This morning bade Adieu in bed to the company of my wife.
We rose andI gave my wife some money to serve her fora time, and
what papers of consequence I had. Then Ileft her to get her ready
and went to my Lord’s with my boy Eliezer to my Lord’s lodging at
Mr. Crews. Here I had much business with my Lord; and papers,
great store, given me by my Lord to dispose of as of the rest. After
that, with Mr. Moore home to my house and took my wife by
coach to the Chequer in Holborne; where after we had drunk &c.,
she took coach and so farewell. Thence with Mr. Hawly to dinner
at Mr. Crews. After dinner, to my own house, where all things
were put up into the dining-room and locked up, and my wife took
the key along with her. This day, in the presence of Mr. Moore
(who made it) and Mr. Hawly, I did (before I went out with my
wife) seal my will to her, wherebyI did give her all that Ihave in the
world but my books, which I gave to my Brother John, excepting
only French books, which my wife is to have. In the evening at the
Admiralty: met my Lord there and got a Comission for Williamson
to be Captain of the Harp frigate.
