Lords day. Up betimes and put ona
black cloth suit with white
Lynings under all, as the fashion is to wear, to appear under the
breeches. So being ready, walked to St. James — where I sat talking
with Mr. Coventry while he made himself ready, about several
businesses of the Navy. And after the Duke being gone out, he andI
walked to Whitehall together over the parke, | telling him what had
happened about Tom Hater; at which he seems very sorry, but tells
me that if it is not made very public it will not be necessary to put
him away at present, but give him a good caucion for the time to
come. However, he will speak to the Duke about it and know his
pleasure. Parted with him there; and I walked back to St. James’s
273
and was there at Masse, and was forced in the croud to kneel down;
and Masse being done, to the King’s head ordinary, whither I sent
for Mr. Creed and there we dined; where many parliament-men
and most of their talk was about the news from Scotland that the
Bishop of Galloway was besieged in his house by some women and
had like to have been outraged, but, I know not how, he was
secured — which is bad news and looks just as it did in the beginning
of the late troubles. From thence they talked of rebellion; and I
perceive they make it their great maxime to be sure to Maister the
City of London, whatever comes of it or from it. After that, to
some other discourse; and among other things, talking of the way
of ordinaries, that it is very convenient because a man knows what
he hath to pay, one did wish that among many bad, we could learn
two good things of France — which were that we would not think it
below the gentleman or person of honour at a taverne to bargain for
his meat before he eats it; and next, to take no servants without
Certificate from some friend or gentleman of his good behaviour
and abilities.
