Up, and with Sir
J.Mennes to Whitehall by his coach, by the
way talking of my brother John, to get a spiritual promotion for
him, which I now am to look after, forasmuch as he is shortly to be
Maister in Arts, and writes me this weeka Latin letter that he is to
go into Orders this Lent. There to the Duke’s chamber and find our
fellows discoursing there on our business; so I was sorry to come
late, but no hurt was done thereby. Here the Duke, among other
things, did bring out a book, of great antiquity, of some of the
customs of the Navy about 100 years since, which he did lend us to
read and deliver him back again. Thence I to the Exchequer, and
there did strike my tallies for a quarter for Tanger and carried them
home with me. And thence to Trinity house, being invited to an
Elder Brother’s feast. And there met and sat by Mr. Prin and had
good discourse about the privileges of Parliament, which he says
are few to the Commons’ house, and those not examinable by them
but only by the House of Lords. Thence with my Lord Bruncker to
587
Gresham College, the first time after the sickness that I was there,
and the second time any met. And hear a good lecture of Mr.
Hookes about the trade of Felt making, very pretty. And anon
alone with me about art of drawing pictures by Prince Roberts rule
and machine, and another of Dr. Wren’s; but he says nothing doth
like Squares, or, which is the best in the world, like a darke roome —
which pleased me mightily. Thence with Povy home to my house,
and there late, settling accounts with him — which was very
troublesome to me. And he gone, found Mr. Hill below, who sat
with me till late talking; and so away, and we to bed.
