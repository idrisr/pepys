To my Lord’s in the morning, where I met with Capt.
Cuttance. But my Lord not being up, Iwent out to Charing cross to
see Maj.-Gen. Harrison hanged, drawn, and quartered — which was
done there — he looking as cheerfully as any man could do in that
condition. He was presently cut down and his head and his heart
shown to the people, at which there was great shouts of joy. It is
said that he said that he was sure to come shortly at the right hand of
Christ to judge them that now have judged him. And that his wife
doth expect his coming again. Thus it was my chance to see the
King beheaded at Whitehall and to see the first blood shed in
revenge for the blood of the King at Charing cross. From thence to
my Lord’s and took Capt. Cuttance and Mr. Sheply to the Sun
taverne and did give them some oysters. After that I went by water
home, where I was angry with my wife for her things lying about,
and in my passion kicked the little fine Baskett which I bought her
in Holland and broke it, which troubled me after I had done it.
Within all the afternoon, setting up shelfes in my study. At night to
bed.
