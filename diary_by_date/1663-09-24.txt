Inthe afternoon, telling my wife that I go to Deptford, I went
by water to Westminster hall; and there finding Mrs. Lane, took her
over to Lambeth where we were lately, and there did what I would
with her but only the main thing, which she would not consent to,
for which God be praised; and yet I came so near, that I was
310
provoked to spend. But trust in the Lord I shall never do so again
while I live. After being tired with her company, I landed her at
Whitehall and so home and at my office writing letters, till 12 at
night almost; and then home to supper and bed and there find my
poor wife hard at work, which grieved my heart to see that Ishould
abuse so good a wretch,* and that it is just with God to make her
bad to me for my wronging of her; but I do resolve never to do the
like again. So to bed.
