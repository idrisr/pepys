Up earely to my father’s, where by appointment Mr. Moore
came to me; and he and I to the Temple, and thence to Westminster
hall to speak with Mr. Wm. Mountagu about his looking upon the
title of those lands whichI do take as Security for 3000] of my Lord’s
money.! That being done, Mr. Moore andI parted; and in the Hall
I met with Mr. Fontleroy (my old acquaintance, whom I have not
seen in a long time) and he and I to the Swan; and in discourse he
seems to be wise and say little, though I know things are changed
against his mind. Thence home by water, where my father, Mr.
Snow and Mr. Moore did dine with me. After dinner Mr. Snow
and I went up together to discourse about the putting out of 80l to a
man which lacks the money and would give me 15/ per annum for
eight years for it — which I did not think profit enough; and so he
seemed to be disappointed by my refusal of it. But ]would not now
part with my money easily.
