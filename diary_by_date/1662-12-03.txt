Called up by Comissioner Pett, and with him (by water much
against my will) to Deptford; and after drinking a warm morning
draught, with Mr. Wood and our officers measuring all the
morning his New England Masts, with which sight I was much
pleased for my information, though I perceive great neglect and
indifference in all the King’s officers in what they do for the King.
That done, to the globe and there dined with Mr. Woode; and so by
water with Mr. Pett home again, all the way reading his Chest
accompts, in which I did see things did not please me; as, his
allowing himself 300! for one year’s looking to the business of the
Chest and 150/ per annum for the rest of the years. But I found no
fault to him himself, but shall when they come to be read at the
board. Home and did alittle business; and so, taking Mr. Pett by the
way, we walked to the Temple, in our way seeing one of the Russia
Embassadors coaches go along, with his footmen not in liverys but
their country habits; one of one colour and another of another,
which was very strange.
