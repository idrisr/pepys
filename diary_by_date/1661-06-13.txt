I went up and down to Ald. Backwells, but his servants not

being up, I went home and put on my gray cloth suit and faced
white coate, made of one of my wife’s pettycoates — the first time
that Ihave had it on. And so, ina riding garbe, back again and spoke
with Mr. Shaw at the Aldermans; who offers me 3001, if my Lord
pleases, to buy cloth with’ - which pleased me well. So to the
Wardrobe and got my Lord to order Mr. Creed to imprest so much
upon me, to be paid by Ald. Backwell. So with my Lord to
Whitehall by water. And he having taken leave of the King, comes
to us at his lodgeings and from thence goes to the garden Staires and
there takes barge. And at the stairs was met by Sir R. Slingsby, who
there took his leave of my Lord; and Iheard my Lord thank him for
his kindness to me, which Sir Robert answered much to my
advantage. I went down with my Lord in the barge to Deptford;
and there went on board the Duch yacht and stayed there a good
while, W. Howe not being come with my Lord’s things, which
made my Lord angry. By and by he comes and so we set sayle; and
anon went to dinner. My Lord and we very merry. And after dinner
I went down below and there sang and took leave of W. Howe,
Capt. Rolt, and the rest of my friends; then went up and took leave
of my Lord, who gave me his hand and parted with great respect.
So went, and Capt. Ferrers with me, into our wherry. And my
Lord did give five guns, all they had charged, which was the
greatest respect my Lord could do me and of which Iwas nota little
proud. So with a sad and merry heart I left them, sailing pleasantly
from Erith, hoping to be in the Downes tomorrow earely. We
toward London in our boat. Pulled off our Stockings and bathed
our legs a great while in the River— which Ihad not done some years
before.
