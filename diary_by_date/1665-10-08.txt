Lords day. Up, and after being trimmed, to the office, whither
I, upon a letter from the Duke of Albemarle to me to order as many
ships forth out of the River as I can presently, to joyne to meet the
Duch, had ordered all the Captains of the ships in the River to come
to me. I did some business with them, and so to Capt. Cockes to
dinner — he being in the country, but here his brother Salomon was,
and for guests, myself, Sir G. Smith, anda
very fine lady, one Mrs.
Penington — and two more Gentlemen. But, both [before] and after
dinner, most excellent witty discourse with this lady, who is a very
fine witty lady, one of the best I ever heard speak — and indifferent
handsome. There after dinner an hour or two, and so to the office,
where ended my business with the Captains; and Ithink of 22 ships,
we shall make shift to get out seven (God help us — men being sick —
or provisions lacking); and so to write letters to Sir Ph. Warwicke,
Sir W. Coventry, and Sir G. Carteret to Court, about the last six
months’ accounts, and sent away by an express tonight.
