Up, and to the office — where by and by Mr. Coventry came;
and after doinga
little business, took his leave of us, being to go to
sea with the Duke tomorrow. At noon I and Sir
J.Mennes and Lord
Berkely (who with Sir J. Duncum and Mr. Chichly are made
Maisters of the Ordnance) to the Office of the Ordnance to
discourse about Wadding for guns. Thence to dinner, all of us, to
the Lieutenant of the Towers — where a good dinner, but disturbed
in the middle of it by the King’s coming into the Tower; and so we
broke up, and to him and went up and down the storehouses and
magazines; which are, with the addition of the new great Store-
house, a noble sight. He gone, I to my office, where Bagwell’s wife
stayed for me; and together with her a good while, to meet again
shortly. So all the afternoon at my office —till late; and then to bed —
joyed in my love and ability to fallow my business. This day Mr.
440
Lever sent my wife a pair of silver candlesticks, very pretty ones —
the first man that ever presented me to whom I have not only done
little service, but apparently did him the greatest disservice in his
business of accounts, as Purser generall, of any man at the board.
