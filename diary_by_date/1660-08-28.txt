At home looking over my papers and books and house as to
the fitting of it to my mind till 2 in the afternoon. Some time I spent
this morning beginning to teach my wife some skill in Musique,
and find her apt beyond imagination. This day I heard my poor
mother hath these two days been very ill, and I fear she will not last
long. To bed —a little troubled that I fear my boy Will is a thief and
hath stole some money of mine — perticularly a letter that Mr.
Jenkins did leave the last week with me with half a crown in to send
to his son.
