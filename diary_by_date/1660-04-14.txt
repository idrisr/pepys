Islept till almost 10 a-clock — and then rise and drank a good
morning draught there with Mr. Sheply, which occasioned my
thinking upon the happy life that I live now, had I nothing to care
for but myself. The sea was this morning very high; and looking
out of the window, I saw our boat come with Mr. Pierce the purser
in it, in great danger; who endeavouring to come on board us, had
like to have been drowned had it not been for a rope.
