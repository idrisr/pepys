To my Lady and dined with her. She told me how danger-
ously ill the Princess Royall is: and that this morning she was said to
be dead. That she hears that she hath married herself to young
Jermin, which is worse then the Duke of Yorkes marrying the
Chancellor’s daughter — which is now publicly owned. After dinner
to the office all the afternoon. At seven at night I walked through
the dirt to Whitehall to see whether my Lord be come to town; and I
find him come — and at supper; and I supped with him. He tells me
that my aunt at Brampton hath voided a great Stone (the first time
that ever I heard she was troubled therewith) and cannot possibly
live long. That my uncle is pretty well, but full of pain still. After
supper home and to bed.
