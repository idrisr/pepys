washing day. My wife andI by water to Westminster. She to her
116
mother’s and I to Westminster hall, where I find a full terme; and
here I went to Will’s and there found Shaw and Ashwell and
another, Brograve (who knew my mother washmaid to my Lady
Veere); who by cursing and swearing made me weary of his
company, and so! went away. Into the Hall and there saw my Lord
Treasurer (who was sworn today at the Exchequer, with a very
great company of Lords and persons of Honour to attend him) go
up to the Treasury Offices and take possession thereof. And also
saw the heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton set up upon the
further end of the hall.
