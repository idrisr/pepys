Lords day. To Whitehall Chappell, where I heard a good
sermon of the Deane of Elys upon Returning to the old wayes —
and a most excellent Anthem (with Symphony’s between) sung
by Capt. Cooke. Then home with Mr. Fox and his lady and
there dined with them, where much company came to them.
Most of our discourse was what Ministers are flung out that will
not conform. And the care of the Bishop of London that we are
here supplied with very good men. Meeting Mr. Pierce the
Chyrurgeon, he took me into Somersett house and there carried
me into the Queene-Mother’s presence-chamber, where she
was, with our own Queene sitting on her left hand (whom I did
never see before; and though she be not very charming, yet she
hath a good modest and innocent look which is pleasing): here I
also saw Madam Castlemayne and, which pleased me most, Mr.
223
Crofts! the King’s bastard, a most pretty sparke of about 15 year
old; who I perceive doth hang much upon my Lady Castlemayne
and is alway with her. And I hear the Queenes, both of them, are
mighty kind to him. By and by, in comes the King, and anon the
Duke and his Duchesse; so that, they being all together, was such a
sight as I could never almost have happened to see with so much
ease and leisure.
