Sir J. Mennes, Sir W. Batten and I going forth toward
Whitehall, we hear that the King and the Duke are come this
morning to the Tower to see the Dunkirke money. So we by coach
to them and there went up and down all the Magazins with them.
But methought it was but poor discourse and frothy that the King’s
companions (young Killigrew among the rest, about the codpieces
on some of the men in armer there to be seen) had with him. We saw
none of the money; but Mr. Slingsby did show the King andI did
see the stamps of the new money that is now to be made by
Blondeau’s fashion, which are very neat and like the King. Thence
the King to Woolwich, though a very cold day; and the Duke to
Whitehall, commanding us to come after him, which we did by
coach; and in his closet, my Lord Sandwich being there, did
discourse with us about getting some of this money to pay off the
Fleets and other matters.
