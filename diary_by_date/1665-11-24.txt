After dinner, Capt. Cocke and I about some business; and
then with my other barrel of oysters home to Greenwich, sent them
by water to Mrs. Penington, while he and I landed and visited Mr.
Eveling — where most excellent discourse with him; among other
things, he showed mea Lieger ofa Treasurer of the Navy, his great-
grandfather, just 100 years old; which Iseemed mighty fond of, and
he did present me with it; which Itake as a great rarity, and he hopes
to find me more, older then it. He also showed us several letters of
the old Lord of Liecesters in Queen Elizabeth’s time — under the
very handwriting of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary Queen of
Scotts and others, very venerable names. But Lord, how poorly
methinks they wrote in those days, and on what plain uncut paper.
Thence, Cocke having sent for his coach, we to Mrs. Penington,
and there sat and talked and eat our oysters with great pleasure; and
so home to my lodging late, and to bed.
