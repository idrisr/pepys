My wife andI to the Theatre and there saw The Joviall Crew,
where the King, Duke and Duchesse, and Madam Palmer were;
and my wife, to her great content, had her full sight of them all, all
the while. The play full of mirth. Thence to my father’s and there
stayed to talk a while; and so by foot home by mooneshine. In my
way and at home, my wife making a sad story to me of her brother
Balty’s condition, and would have me to do something for him;
which I shall endeavour to do, but am afeared to meddle therein for
fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands of him again when I once
concern myself for him. I went to bed, my wife all the while telling
me his case with teares, which troubled me.
