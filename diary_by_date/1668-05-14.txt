Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and at
noon home to dinner with my people; but did not stay to dine out
with them, but rose and straight by water to the Temple, and so to
Penny’s my tailor; where by and by, by agreement comes Mercer
and she to my great content brings Mrs. Gayet, and I carried them
to the King’s House; but coming too soon, we out again to the Rose
tavern and there I did give them a tankard of cool drink, the weather
being very hot; and then into the playhouse again and there saw The
Country Captain, a very dull play that did give us no content; and
besides, little company there, which made it very unpleasing.
Thence to the waterside at Strand bridge, and so up by water and to
Foxhall, where we walked a great while, and pleased mightily with
the pleasure thereof and the company there; and then in and eat and
drank, and then out again and walked; and it beginning to be dark,
we to a Corner and sang, that everybody got about us to hear us;
and so home, where I saw them both at their doors; and full of the
909
content of this afternoon’s pleasure, I home and to walk in the
gardenalittle, and so home to bed.
