Up, and [my wife] with me as heretofore; and so I to the
office, where all the morning; and at noon to dinner, and Mr.
Wayth, who being at my office about business, I took him with me
to talk and understand his matters. And so having dined, we parted,
and I to my wife and to sit with hera
little; and then called her and
Willet to my chamber, and there did with tears in my eyes, which I
could not help, discharge her and advise her to be gone as soon as
she could, and never to see me or let me see her more while she was
in the house; which she took with tears too, but I believe
understands me to be her friend; and I am apt to believe, by what
my wife hath of late told me, is a Cunning girl, if not a slut.
