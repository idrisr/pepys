Up betimes to the Duke of Albemarle about money to be got
for the Navy, or else we must shut up shop. Thence to Westminster
hall and up and down, doing not much; then to London, but to
prevent Povys dining with me (whoI see is at the Change) I went

meat and dined, and then to my Lord Treasurers and there with Sir

chamber with Sir Philip till dark night, about four hours talking of
the business of Navy charge and how Sir G. Carteret doth order

to get the City to do it —it is impossible to find money. We having

which comes to 2500000l. Being very glad of this day’s discourse,
in all but that Ifear Ishall quite lose Sir G. Carteret, who knows that
I have been privately here all this day with Sir Ph. Warwicke.
However, I will order it so as to give him as little offence as I can. So
home to my office, and then to supper and to bed.
