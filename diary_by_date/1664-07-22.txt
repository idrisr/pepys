Upandto my office, where busy all the morning. At noon to
the Change, and so home to dinner and then down by water to
Deptford; where coming too soon, Ispent an hour in looking round
the yard and putting Mr. Shish to measure a piece or two of timber;
which he did most cruelly wrong and to the King’s loss, 12 or 13s.
in a piece of 28f[oot] in contents. Thence to the Clerke of the
Cheques, from whose house Mr. Falconer was buried today — Sir
J.
Mennes and I the only principall officers that were there. We
walked to church with him; and then Ileft them without staying the
sermon, and straight home by water and there find as I expected,
Mr. Hill and Andrews and one slovenly and ugly fellow, Seignor
Pedro, who sings Italian songs to the Theorbo most neatly;
407
and they spent the whole evening in singing the best piece of
musique, counted of all hands in the world, made by Seignor
Charissimi the famous master in Rome. Fine it was endeed, and too
fine for me to judge of. They have spoke to Pedro to meet us every
week, andI fear it will grow a trouble to me if we once come to bid
guests to meet us, especially idle masters — which dothalittle
displease me to consider. They gone, comes Mr. Lanyon, who tells
me Mr. Alsop is now become dangerously ill and fears his
recovery, which shakes my expectation of 300/ per annum by that
business. And therefore bless God for what Mr. Gauden hath sent
me; which from some discourse today with Mr. Osborne,
swearing that he knows not anything of this business of the
victualling but the contrary, that it is not that that moves Mr.
Gauden to send it me, for he hath had order for it any time these two
months. Whether this be true or no, I know not; but I shall hence
with the more confidence keep it. To supper and to the officea
little
and to walk in the garden, the moon shining bright and fine warm
fair weather. And so home to bed.
