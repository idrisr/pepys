Atnoon dined at home; and after dinner my wife andI to Sir
W. Penn’s to see his Lady the first time — who is a well-looked, fat,
short, old Dutchwoman, but one that hath been heretofore pretty
handsome; and is now very discreet and I believe hath more wit
then her husband. Here we stayed talking a good while. And very
well pleased I was with the old woman at first visit. So away home,
and Ito my office; my wife to go see my aunt Wight, newly come to
town. Creed came to me and he and I out; among other things, to
look out a man to make a case for to keep my Stone that I was cut of
in. And he to buy Daniels History; which he did, but I missed of my
end. So parted upon Ludgate hill and I home and to the office,
where busy till supper; and home to supper to a good dish of
fritters, which I bespoke and were done much to my mind; then to
the office a while again, and so home to bed.
