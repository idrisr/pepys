I rose and went to Westminster hall, and there walked up and
down upon several businesses; and among others, Imet with Sir W.
Pen, who told me that he had this morning heard Sir G. Carteret
extreme angry against my man Will; that he was every other day
with the Comissioners of Parliament at Westminster and that his
uncle’ was a rogue and that he did tell his uncle everything that
passes at the office.
