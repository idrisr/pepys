Inthe morning to see the Dock houses. First, Mr. Pett’s the
builder, and there was very kindly received. And among other
things, he did offer my Lady Batten a parrot, the best ever I saw —
that knew Mingo as soonas it saw him, having bred formerly in the
house with them. But for talking and singing, Inever heard the like.
My Lady did accept ofit. At night, to Hempson’s: here we had, for
my sake, two fiddles, the onea bass viall; on which he that played,
played well some Lyra lessons,* but both together made the worst
musique that ever I heard. We hada
fine collacion, but I took little
pleasure in that, for the illnesse of the Musique and for the
intentnesse of my mind upon Mrs. Rebecca Allen. After we had
done eating, the ladies went to dance; and among the men we had, I
was forced to dance too —and did make an ugly shift. Mrs. R. Allen
danced very well, and seems the best-humourd woman that ever I
saw. Among other things, Capt. Pett was saying that he thought
that he had got his wife with Childe since I came thither.’ Which I
tooke hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to
have it said for my honour that it was of my getting? He merrily
answered that he would, if1 would promise to be godfather to it ifit
did come within the time just; and I said that I would. So that Imust
remember to compute it when the time comes.
1. In January 1661.
