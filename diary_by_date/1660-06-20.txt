Upby4inthe morning to write letters to sea and a Comission
for him that Murford solicits for. Called on by Capt. Sparling, who
did give me my Duch money again, and so much as he had changed
into English money, by which my mind was eased of a great deal of
trouble — and some other sea-Captains. I did give them a good
morning draught. And so to my Lord, who lay long in bed this day,
because he came home late from supper with the King. With my
Lord to the Parliament house; and after that, with him to Gen.
Monkes, where he dined at the Cockepitt. I home and dined with
my wife, now making all things ready there again.
