The Dancing Maister came; whom standing by seeing him
instructing my wife, when he had done with her he would needs
have me try the steps of a Coranto; and what with his desire and my
wife’s importunity, I did begin, and then was obliged to give him
entry-money, 10s. — and am become his Scholler. The truth is, I
think it is a thing very useful for any gentleman and sometimes |
may have occasion of using it; and though it cost me, which I am
heartily sorry it should, besides that I must by my oath give half as
much more to the poor, yet I am resolved to get it up some other
way; and then it will not be above a month or two ina year. So
though it be against my stomach, yet Iwill try it a little while; if] see
it comes to any great inconvenience or charge, I will fling it off.
After I had begun with the steps of half a coranto, which I think I
shall learn well enough, he went away and we to dinner.
