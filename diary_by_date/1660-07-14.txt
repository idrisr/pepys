Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our
things in a readiness to be sent to our new house. To Westminster
hall, where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from
thence. Here Imet with Mr. Eglin, who would needs take me to the
Leg in King’s street and give me a dish of meat to dinner; and so I
sent for Monsieur Limpertinent, where we sat long and were
merry. After that, parted; and I took Mr. Butler with me into
London by coach and showed him my house at the Navy Office.
And did give order for the laying in coals. So into Fanchurch street
and there did give him a glass of wine at Rawlinson’s, and was
trimmed in the street. So to my Lord’s late writing letters; and so
home, where I find my wife hath packed up all her goods in the
house, fit for a removal. So to bed.
