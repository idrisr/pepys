earely up to Court with Sir Wm. Pen; where at Mr. Coventry’s
chamber we met with all our fellow officers; and there a hot debate
about the business of paying off the fleet and how we should joyne
with the Commissioners of Parliament. That being done, I to the
tavern, where Sir Wm. Pen and the Comptroller and several others
were, men and women; and we had a very great and merry dinner.
And after dinner the Comptroller begun some sports; among
others, the Nameing of people round, and afterward demanding
Questions of them that they are forced to answer their names to;
which doth make very good sport. And here I took pleasure to take
the forfeits of the ladies who could not do their duty, by kissing of
them — among others, a pretty lady who I found afterward to be
wife to Sir W. Battens son.
