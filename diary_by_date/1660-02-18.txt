A great while at my Viall and voice, learning to sing Fly boy,
fly boy without book. So to my office, where little to do. In the Hall
I met with Mr. Eglin and one Looker, a famous gardiner, servant to
my Lord Salsbury; and among other things, the gardiner told a
strange passage in good earnest: how formerly Mr. Eglin did in his
company put his finger, which being sore had a black case over it,
into a woman’s belly, he named her Nan (which I guess who it is),
and left his case within her; which Mr. Eglin blushed but did not
deny it. Which truly I was sorry to hear and did think of it a good
while afterward. Home to dinner; and then went to my Lord’s
lodgings to my turret there, and took away most of my books and
sent them_home by my maid. Hither came Capt. Holland to me,
who took me to the Half Moone tavern and Mr. Southorne,
Blackburnes clerk. Thence he took me to the Mitre in Fleet street,
where we heard (in a room over the music-room) very plainly
through the ceiling. Here we parted, and Ito Mr. Wottons and with
him to an alehouse and drank; where he told mea great many stories
of comedies which he had formerly seen acted and the names of the
principal actors, and gave me a very good account of it. Hence to
Whitehall, where I met with Lueliin and at the Clerkes chamber
wrote a letter to my Lord. So home and to bed. This day, two
soldiers were hanged in the Strand for their late mutiny at Somerset
house.
