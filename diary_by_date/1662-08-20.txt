Up earely and to my office. And thence to my Lord
Sandwich, who find in bed and he sent for me in; and among other
talk, doth tell me that he hath put me into commission with a great
many great persons in the business of Tanger,'whichis a very great
Honour to me and may be of good concernment to me. By and by
comes in Mr. Coventry to us, who my Lord tells that he is also put
into the commission, and that I am there; of which he said he was
glad and did tell my Lord that Iwas endeed the life of this office, and
much more to my commendation, beyond measure. And that
whereas before he did bear me respect for his sake, he doth do it
now much more for my own -—
whichis a great blessing to me— Sir
G. Carteret having told me what he did yesterday concerning his
speaking to my Lord Chancellor about me. So that on all hands, by
God’s blessing, I find myself a very rising man. By and by comes
my Lord Peterborow in, with whom we talked a good while, and
he is going tomorrow towards Tanger again. I perceive there is yet
little hopes of peace with Guyland, which is of great concernment
to Tanger. And many other things I heard which yet I understand
not, and so cannot remember. In the evening Mr. Hayward came to
me to advise with him about the business of the Chest, which I
have now a mind to put in practice, though I know it will vex Sir
Wm. Batten — which is one of the ends, God forgive me, that Ihave
in it. So home and eat a bit, and to bed.
