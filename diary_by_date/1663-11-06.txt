This morning, waking, my wife was mighty earnest with me
to persuade me that she should prove with child — which ifit be, let
it come and welcome. Up to my office, whither Comissioner Pett
came, newly come out of the country, and he and Iwalked together
in the garden, talking of business a great while. Thence, he being
gone, to my office and there despatched many people. And at noon
to the Change to the Coffee-house; and among other things, heard
Sir John Cutler say that of his own experience in time of thunder, so
many barrels of beer as have a piece of Iron laid upon them will not
be stirred, and the others will.
