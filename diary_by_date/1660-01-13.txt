To my office, where nothing to do. So to Will’s with Mr.
Pinkny, who invited me to their feast at his Hall the next Monday.
Thence I went home and took my wife and dined at Mr. Wade’s.
And after that we went and visited Catau.' From thence home
again, and my wife was very unwilling to let me go forth; but with
some discontent, would go out if I did; and I going forth towards
Whitehall, I saw she fallowed me, and so I stayed and took her
round through Whitehall, and so carried her home angry.
