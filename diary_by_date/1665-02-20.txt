Up, and with Sir
J.Mennes to attend the Duke; and then we
back again and rode into the beginnings of my Lord Chancellors
new house,near St. James’s, which common people have already
called Dunkirke house, from their opinion of his having a good
bribe for the selling of that town.’ And very noble I believe it will
be. Near that is my Lord Berkely beginning another on one side,
and Sir
J.Denham on the other. Thence Ito the House of Lords and
spoke with my Lord Bellases; and so to the Change and there did
business; and so to the Sun Taverne — having in the morning had
some high words with Sir J. Lawson about his sending of some
bayled goods to Tanger; wherein the truth is, I did not favour him.
But being conscious that some of my profit may come out, by some
words that fell from him; and to be quiet, I have accommodated it.
Here we dined, merry; but my club and the rest come to 7s. 6d.,
which was too much. Thence to the office and there found
Bagwells wife, whom I directed to go home and I would do her
business; which was to write a letter to my Lord Sandwich for her
husband’s advance into a better ship as there should be occasion —
which I did; and by and by did go down by water to Deptford yard,
and then down further and so landed at the lower end of the town;
and it being dark, did privately entrer en la maison de la femme de
Bagwell, and there I had sa compagnie, though witha great deal of
difficulty; néanmoins, enfin je avais ma volonté d’elle. And being
sated therewith, I walked home to Redriffe, it being now near 9 a-
clock; and there I did drink some strong waters and eat some bread
and cheese, and so home — where at my office, my wife comes and
tells me that she hath hired a chambermaid, one of the prettiest
maids that ever she saw in her life, and that she is really jealous of me
for her — but hath ventured to hire her from month to month. But I

think she means merrily. So to supper and to bed.
