Up, and with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Penn to Whitehall; but
there finding the Duke gone to his lodgings at St. James’s for
altogether, his Duchesse being ready to lie in, we to him and there
did our usual business. And here Imet the great news, confirmed by
the Dukes own relation, by a letter from Capt. Allen — first, of our
loss of two ships, the Phenix and Nonesuch, in the Bayof Gibraltar —
then, of his and his seven ships with him, in the Bay of Cales or
thereabouts, fight with the 34 Duch Smirna fleet — sinking the King
Salamon, a ship worth 150000! or more, some say 200000!, and
another, and taking three merchant-ships. Thence to Jervas’s, my
mind, God forgive me, running too much after sa fille, but elle not
being within, I away by coach to the Change — and thence home to
dinner; and finding Mrs. Bagwell waiting at the office after dinner,
away elle and I to a cabaret where elle and I have été before; and
there I had her company toute l’aprés-diner and had mon plein
plaisir of elle — but strange, to see how a woman, notwithstanding
her greatest pretences of love 4 son mari and religion, may be
vaincue. Thence to the Court of the Turky Company at Sir Andr.
Rickard’s, to treat about carrying some men ofours to Tanger, and
had there a very civil reception, though a denial of the thing, as not
practicable with them, and Ithink so too. So to my office a little; but
being minded to make an end of my pleasure today, that I might
fallow my business, I did take coach and to Jervas’s again, thinking
to avoir rencontré Jane; mais elle n’était pas dedans. So I back again
to my office, where I did with great content faire a vow to mind my
business and laisser aller les femmes for a month; and am with all
my heart glad to find myself able to come to so gooda resolution,
that thereby I may fallow my business, which, and my honour
thereby, lies a-bleeding. So home to supper and to bed.
