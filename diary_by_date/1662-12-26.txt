Up. My wife to the making of Christmas-pies all day, being
now pretty well again. And I abroad to several places about small
businesses; among others, bought a bake pan in Newgate market
and sent it home; it cost me 16s. Then to [Mr. Moore at] the
Wardrobe, who is not yet well. Hither came Mr. Battersby; and we
falling into a discourse of a new book of Drollery in verse called
Hudebras, | would needs go find it out; and met with it at the
Temple, cost me 2s.- 6d. But when I came to read it, it is so silly an
abuse of the Presbyter-Knight going to the warrs, that I am
ashamed of it; and by and by meeting at Mr. Townsends at dinner, I
sold it to him for 18d.
