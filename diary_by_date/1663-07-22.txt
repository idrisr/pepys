Abroad, calling at several places upon small errands; among
others, to my brother Toms barbers and had my hair cut while his
boy played on the vyallin; a plain boy, but hath a very good genius
and.understands the book very well. Thence to my Lord Crews:
my Lord not being come home, I met and stayed below with Capt.
Ferrer, who was come to wait upon my Lady Jemimah to St.
James’s, she being one of the four ladies that holds up the mantle at
the christening this afternoon of the Dukes child, a boy. In
discourse of the ladies at Court, Capt. Ferrer tells me that my Lady
Castlemayne is now as great again as ever she was, and that her
going away was onlya fit of her own, upon some slighting words
of the King’s, so that she called for her coach at a Quarter of an
hour’s warning and went to Richmond; and the King the next
morning, under pretence of going a-hunting, went to see her and
make friends, and never was a-hunting at all — after which she came
back to Court and commands the King as much as ever, and hath
294
and doth what she will. This day I hear that the Moores have made
some attaques upon the outworkes of Tanger; but my Lord Tiviott,
with the loss of about 200 men, did beat them off, and killed many
of them.
