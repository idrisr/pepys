Thisnoon Mr. Coventry discoursed largely and bravely to me
concerning the different sort of valours, the active and passive
valour. For the latter, he brought as an instance General Blacke,
who in the defending of Taunton and Lime for the Parliament did
through his stubborn sortof valour defend it the most opiniastrement
that ever any man did anything — and yet never was the man that
ever made any attaque by land or sea, but rather avoyded it on all,
even fair occasions. On the other side, Prince Rupert the boldest
attaquer in the world for personal courage; and yet in the defending
of Bristoll, no man did ever anything worse, he wanting the
391
patience and seasoned head to consult and advise for defence and to
bear with the evils of a Siege. The like he says is said of my Lord
Tiviott, who was the boldest adventurer of his person in the world,
and from a mean man in few years was come to this greatness of
command and repute only by the death of all his officers, he many
times having the luck of being the only survivor of them all, by
venturing upon services for the King of France that nobody else
would. And yet no man upon a defence — he being all fury and no
judgment ina fight. He tells me above all of the Duke of Yorke, that
he is more himself, and more of judgment is at hand in him, in the
middle of a desperate service then at other times — as appeared in the
business of Dunkirke, wherein no man ever did braver things or
was in hotter service in the close of that day, being surrounded with
enemies; and then, contrary to the advice of all about him, his
counsel carried himself and the rest through them safe
— by advising
that he might make his passage with but a dozen with him; “‘For,”’
says he, “the enemy cannot move after me so fast with a great body,
and with a small one we shall be enough to deal with them.” And
though he is a man naturally Martiall to the highest degree, yet a
man that never in his life talks one word of himself or service of his
own; but only that he saw such or sucha thing, and lays it down for
a maxime that a Hector can have no courage. He told me also, as a
great instance of some men, that the Prince of Conde’s excellence is
that there not being a more furious man in the world, danger in
fight never disturbs him, more then just to make him Civill and to
command in words of great obligation to his officers and men but
without any the least disturbance in his judgment or spirit.
