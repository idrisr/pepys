After dinner I went to the Theatre, where I saw The Lost lady,
which doth not please me much. Here I was troubled to be seen by
four of our office Clerkes, which sat in‘the half-Crowne box and I in
the 1s. 6d. From hence by Linke, and bought two mousetrapps of
Tho. Pepys the Turner; and so went and drank a cup of ale with
him; and so home and wrote by post to Portsmouth to my Lord,
and so to bed.
