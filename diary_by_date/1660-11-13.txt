earely going to my Lord’s, I met with Mr. Moore (who was
going to my house; and endeed I find to be a most careful, painful,
and able man in business) and took him by water to the Wardrobe
and showed him all the house; and endeed there is a great deal of
roome in it — but very ugly till my Lord hath bestowed great cost
upon it. So to the Exchequer and there took Spicer and his fellow
Clarke to the Dogg taverne and did give them a peck of oysters; and
so home to dinner. Where I find my wife making of pyes and tarts
to try her oven with (which she hath never yet done); but not
knowing the nature of it, did heat it too hot and so didalittle
overbake her things, but knows how to do better another time. At
home all the afternoon. At night made up my accounts of my Sea
expences in order to my clearing of my imprest bill of 30! which I
had in my hands at the beginning of my voyage — which Ientend to
show to my Lord tomorrow. To bed.
