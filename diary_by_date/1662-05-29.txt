With my wife and the two maids and the boy took boat and to
Foxhall — where I have not been a great while — to the Old Spring
garden. And there walked long and the wenches gathered pinks.
Here we stayed; and seeing that we could not have anything to eat
but very dear and with long stay, we went forth again without any
notice taken of us; and so we might have done if we had had
anything. Thence to the New one, where Inever was before, which
much exceeds the other. And here we also walked, and the boy
creeps through the hedge and gather[s] abundance of roses. And
after long walk, passed out of doors as we did in the other place.
And so to another house that was an ordinary house, and here we
have cakes and powdered beef and ale; and so home again by water,
with much pleasure. This day, being the Kings birthday, was very
solemnely observed; and the more for that the Queene this day
comes to Hampton Court. In the evening bonefires were made, but
nothing to the great number that was heretofore at the burning of
the Rump. So to bed.
