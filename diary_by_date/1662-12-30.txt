To the Change-ward to see what play there was, but I liked
none of them; and so homeward and calling in at Mr. Rawlinsons,
where he stopped me to dine with him and two East India officers of
ships and Howell our Turner. With the officers I had good
discourse, perticularly of the people at the Cape of Good Hope - of
whom they of their own knowledge do tell me these one or two
things. viz., that when they come to age, the men do cut off one of
the stones of each other, which they hold doth help them to get
children the better and to grow fat. That they never sleep lying, but
always sitting upon the ground. That their speech is not so
articulate as ours, but yet understand one another well. That they
paint themselfs all over with the grease the Duch sell them (who
have a fort there) and Sutt. After dinner, drinking five or six glasses
of wine (which liberty Inow take till Ibegin my oath again), I went
home.
