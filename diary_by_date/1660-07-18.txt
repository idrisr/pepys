This morning the carpenter made an end of my door out of
my chamber upon the leads. This morning we met at the office. I
dined at my house in Seething lane. Thence to my Lord about
business; and being in talk, in comes one with half a Bucke from
Hinchingbrooke, and it smelling a little strong, my Lord did give it
me, though it was as good as any could be. I did carry it to my
mother to dispose of as she pleased. After that home; where WII.
Ewre! now was and did lie this night with us, the first night.
