My wife and Iup very early this day. And though the weather
was bad and the wind high, yet my Lady Batten and her mayde and
we two did go by our barge to Woolwich (my Lady being very
fearful), where we found both Sir Wms: and much other company,
expecting the weather to be better that they might go about
weighing up the Assurance, which lies there under water; only the
upper deck may be seen, and the masts. Capt. Stoakes is very
melancholly; and being in search for some clothes and money of
his, which he says he hath lost out of his Cabbin, I did the first office
of a Justice of Peace to examine a seaman thereupon. But could find
no reason to commit him. After dinner, my Lady being very
fearefull, she stayed and kept my wife there; and I and another
gentleman, a friend of Sir W. Pen’s, went back in the barge; very
merry by the way, and I went as far as Whitehall in her. To the
Privy Seale, where I signed many pardons and some few things
else. From thence, Mr. Moore and J into London to a taverne near
my house and there we drank and discoursed of ways how to put
out a little money to the best advantage. And at present he hath
persuaded me to put out 250 for sol per annum for eight years — and
Ithink I shall do it. Thence home— whereI find the wench washing:
and Iup to my study, and there did make up an even 100/ and sealed
it to lie by. After that to bed.
