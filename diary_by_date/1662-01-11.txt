To Sir Wm. Battens, where in discourse I heard the Custome
of the Eleccion of the Dukes of Genoa, who for two years are every
day attended in the greatest state and 4 or 500 men always waiting

may be but with one man at his heels, and the new one brought
immediately in his room, in the greatest state in the world. Another
account was told us, how in the Dukedome of Regusa in the
Adriatique (a State that is little, but more ancient they say then

about it — that they change all the officers of their guard, for fear of
conspiracy, every 24 houres, so that nobody knows who shall be
Captain of the guard tonight; but two men come to a man, and lay
hold of him as a prisoner and carry him to the place; and there he
hath the keys of the garrison given him, and he presently issues his
orders for that night’s Watch; and so always, from night to night.
Sir Wm. Rider told the first of his own knowledge; and both he and
Sir Wm. Batten confirm the last.
