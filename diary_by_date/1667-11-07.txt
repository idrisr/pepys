Up, and at the office hard all the morning; and at noon resolve
with Sir W. Penn to go see The Tempest, an old play of
Shakespeares, acted here the first day. And so my wife and girl and
W. Hewer by themselfs, and Sir W. Penn and I afterward by
ourselfs, and forced to sit in the side Balcone over against the
Musique-room at the Dukes House, close by my Lady Dorsett and
a great many great ones: the house mighty full, the King and Court
there, and the most innocent play that ever I saw, and a curious
piece of Musique in an Echo of half-sentences, the Echo repeating
the former half while the man goes on to the latter, which is mighty
pretty. The play no great wit; but yet good, above ordinary plays.
Thence home with W. Penn, and there all mightily pleased with the
play; and so to supper and to bed, after having done at the office.
