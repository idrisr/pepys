Lords day. Up and spent the morning till the Barber came in
reading in my chamber part of Osborne’s Advice to his Son (which I
shall not never enough admire for sense and language); and being
by and by trimmed — to church, myself, wife, Ashwell, &c; and
home to dinner, it raining. While that was prepared, to my office to
read over my vowes, with great affection* and to very good
purpose. So to dinner, and very well pleased with it. Then to
266
church again, where a simple bawling young Scott preached. So
home to my office alone till dark, reading some part of my old Navy
precedents, and so home to supper. And after some pleasant talk, my
wife, Ashwell and I — to prayers and to bed.
