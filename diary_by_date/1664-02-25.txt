Up and to the office, where we sat, and thence with Mr.
Coventry by coach to the Glasshouse and there dined, and both
before and after did my Lord Peterborough’s accounts. Thence
home to the office and there did business till called by Creed; and
with him by coach (setting my wife at my brother’s) to my Lord’s
and saw the young ladies and talkeda
little with them; and thence to
Whitehall a while, talking but doing no business; but resolved of
going to meet my Lord tomorrow, having got a horse of Mr.
Coventry today. So home, taking up my wife. And after doing
something at my office, home, God forgive me, disturbed in mind
out of my jealousy of my wife tomorrow when I am out of town,
which is a hell to my mind and yet without all reason. God forgive
me for it and mend me. So home, and getting my things ready for
my journey, to bed.
