This morning Itried on my riding-cloth suit with close knees,
the first that ever I made, and I think they will be very convenient —
ifnot too hot to wear any other open-knees after them. At the office
all the morning — where we havea full Board, viz., Sir G. Carteret,
Sir John Mennes, Sir W. Batten, Mr. Coventry, Sir W. Pen, Mr.
Pett and myself. Among many other businesses, I did get a vote
signed by all concerning my issuing of warrants, which they did not
smell the use I entend to make of it; but it is to plead for my clerks to
have their right of giving out all warrants, in which I am nota little
pleased. But a great difference happened between Sir G. Carteret
and Mr. Coventry about passing the victuallers account, and
whether Sir George is to pay the Victualler his money, or the
Exchequer; Sir George claiming it to be his place to save his
threepences.! It ended in anger, and I believe will come to be a
Question before the King and Council. I did what I could to keep
myself unconcerned in it, having some things of my own to do
before I would appear high in anything.
