Up, and Mr. Cesar, my boy’s lute Maister, being come
betimes to teach him, I did speak with him seriously about the boy,
what my mind was ifhe did not look after his lute and singing, that I
would turn him away — which I hope will do some good upon the
boy. All the morning busy at the office. Atnoon dined at home; and
then to the office again, very busy till very late; and so home to
supper and to bed — my wife making great preparation to go to
483
Court to chapel to-morrow. This day I have news from Mr.
Coventry that the fleet is sailed yesterday from Harwich to the coast
of Holland, to see what the Duch will do. God go along with them.
