Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning and
finished Sir W. Warren’s great contract for timber; with great
content to me, because just in the terms I wrote last night to Sir W.
Warren, and against the terms proposed by Sir W. Batten. At noon
home to dinner and there find Creed and Hawly. After dinner
comes in Mrs. Ingram, the first time, to make a visit to my wife.
After a little stay I left them, and to the committee of the Fishery,
and there did make my report of the late public Collections for the
Fishery, much to the satisfaction of the Comittee, and I think much
to my reputation, for good notice was taken of it and much it was
commended. So home (in my way taking care ofa piece of plate for
Mr. Chr. Pett, against the lanching of his new great ship tomorrow
at Woolwich, which I singly did move to His Royall Highness
yesterday, and did obtain it for him, to the value of 20 peeces). And
he, under his hand, doth acknowledge to me that he did never
receive so great a kindness from any man in the world as from me
herein. So to my office and then to supper; and then to my office
435
again, where busy late, being very full nowadays of business, to my
great content Ithank God; and so home to bed- my house being full
of a design to go tomorrow, my wife and all her servants, to see the
new ship lanched.
