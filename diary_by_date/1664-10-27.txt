Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy. At noon Sir
G. Carteret, Sir
J.Mennes, Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Penn and myself
436
were treated at the Dolphin by Mr. Foly the Ironmonger, where a
good plain dinner; but I expected Musique, the missing of which
spoiled my dinner. Only, very good merry discourse at dinner.
Thence with Sir G. Carteret by coach to Whitehall to a committee
of Tanger: and thence back to London, and light in Cheapside and I
to Nellsons; and there met with a rub at first, but took him out to
drink and there discoursed, to my great content, so far with him
that I think I shall agree with him for Bewpers, to serve the Navy
with. So with great content home and to my office, where late. And
having got a great cold in my head yesterday, home to supper and
to bed.
