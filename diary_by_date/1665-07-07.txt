Up, and having set my neighbour Mr. Hudson, wine cooper,
at work drawing outa tierce of wine for the sending of some of it to
my wife —I abroad, only taking notice to what a condition it hath
pleased God to bring me, that at this time Ihave two tierces of claret
— two quarter-cask of canary, and a smaller vessel of sack — a vessel
of tent, another of Malaga, and another of white wine, all in my
wine-cellar together — which I believe none of my friends of my
name now alive ever had of his own at one time.
