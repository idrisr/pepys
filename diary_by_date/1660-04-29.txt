Sunday. This day I put on first my fine cloth suit, made of
a
cloak that had like to have been beshit behind a year ago the very
day that I put it on. After sermon in the morning, Mr. Cooke came
from London witha packet, bringing news how all the young lords
that were not in arms against the Parliament do now sit. That a
letter is come from the King to the House; which 1s locked up by the
Council till next Tuesday, that it may be read in the open House
when they meet again, they having adjourned till then to keepa fast
tomorrow — and so the contents is not yet known.
