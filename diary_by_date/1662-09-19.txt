Up betimes and to my office; and at 9 a-clock (none of the rest
going) I went alone to Deptford and there went on to pay
Woolwich yard; and so at noon dined well, being chief at the table,
and do not see but everybody begins to give me as much respect and
honour as any of the rest. After dinner to pay again and so till 9 at
night — my great trouble being that I was forced to begin an ill
practice of bringing down the wages of servants, for which people
did curse me; which I do not love. At night, after I had eaten a cold
pullet, I walked by brave Mooneshine, with three or four armed
[men] to guard me, to Redriffe — it being a joy to my heart to think
of the condition that I am now in, that people should of themselfs
provide this for me, unspoke to. I hear this walk is dangerous to
walk alone by night, and much robbery committed here. So from
thence by water home. And so to my lodgings to bed.
