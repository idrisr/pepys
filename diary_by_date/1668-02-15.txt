Up betimes, and with Capt. Cocke by coach to the Temple to
his Counsel again about the prize goods, in order to the drawing up
his answer to them; where little done but a confirmation that our
best interest is for him to tell the whole truth; and so parted, and I
home to the office, where all the morning. And at noon home to
dinner; and after dinner, all the afternoon and evening till midnight
almost, and till I had tired my own backe and my wife’s and Deb’s,
in titleing of my books for the present year and in setting them in
order; which is now done to my very good satisfaction, though not
altogether so completely as I think they were last year, when my
mind was more at leisure to mind it. So about midnight to bed,
where my wife taking some physic overnight it wrought with her;
and those coming upon her with great gripes, she was in mighty
pain all night long; yet God forgive me, I did find that I was more
desirous to take my rest then to ease her; but there was nothing I
could do to do her any good with.
