This day it was moved in the House that a day might be
appointed to bring in an Impeachment against the Chancellor, but it
was decried as being irreguler; but that if there was ground for
complaint, it might be brought to the committee for miscarriages,
and if they thought good, to present it to the House; and so it was
carried.
