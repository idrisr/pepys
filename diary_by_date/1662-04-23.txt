Up earely and to Petersfield, and there dined well; and thence
got a contry-man to guide us by Havan, to avoid going through the
forrest;! but he carried us much out of the way. The Doctor and I
lay together at Wiards the Chyrurgeons in Portsmouth —his wife a
very pretty woman. We lay very well and merrily. In the morning,
concluding him to be of the eldest blood and house of the Clerkes,
because that all the fleas came to him and not to me.
