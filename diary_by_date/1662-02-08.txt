All morning in the sellar with the Colliers, removing the Coles
out of the old coal-hole into the new one, which cost me 8s. the
doing; but now the cellar is done and made clean, it doth please me
exceedingly, as much as anything that was ever yet done to my
house. I pray God keep me from setting my mind too much uponit.
About 3 a-clock, the Colliers having done, I went up to dinner (my
wife having often urged me to come, but my mind is so set upon
these things that I cannot but be with the workmen to see things
done to my mind; which if am not there is seldom done); and so to
the office, and thence to talk with Sir W. Penn, walking in the dark
in the garden some turns, he telling me of the ill management of our
office and how Wood the Timber merchant and others were very
Knaves, which I am apt to believe. Home, and wrote letters to my
father and my brother John, and so to bed — beingalittle chillish —
entending to take physique tomorrow morning.
