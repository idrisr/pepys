Up, and all the morning busy at the office to my great
content, tending to the settling of papers there, that I may have the
more rest in winter for my eyes by how muchI do the more in the
settling of all things in the summer by daylight. At noon home to
dinner, where is brought home the Espinette Ibought the other day
of Haward; costs me s/. So to St. James’s, where did our ordinary
business with the Duke of York. And so to Unthankes to my wife,
and with her and Deb to visit Mrs. Pierce, whom I do not now so
much affect since she paints. But stayed here a while, and
understood from her how my Lady Duchess of Monmouth is still
lame, and likely alway to be so — which is a sad chance for a young
[lady] to get, only by trying of tricks in dancing. So home, and
there Capt. Deane came and spent the evening with me, to draw
some finishing lines on his fine draft of the Resolution, the best ship,
by all report, in the world. And so to bed. Wonderful hot all day
and night, and this the first night that I remember in my life that
ever I could lie with only a sheet and one rug; so much I am now
stronger then ever I remember myself to be, at least since before I
had the stone.
