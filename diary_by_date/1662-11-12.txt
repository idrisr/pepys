Atnoon dined at home with my wife. And by and by, by my
wife’s appointment comes two young ladies, sisters, acquaintance
of my wife’s brother’s, who are desirous to wait upon some ladies —
and proffer their service to my wife. The youngest, endeed, hath a
good voice and sings very well, besides other good Qualitys; but I
fear hath been bred up with too great liberty for my family, and I
fear great inconveniences of expenses and my wife’s liberty will
fallow, which I must study to avoide till I have a better purse —
though I confess the gentlewoman being pretty handsome and
singing makes me have a good mind to her. Anon I took them by
coach and carried them to a friend’s of theirs in Lincolnes Inne
fields, and there I left them. Thence I walked home, callinga
little in
Paul’s Churchyard; and I thank God, can read and never buy a
book, though I have a great mind to it. From hence home to my
office and there made an end, though late, of my colleccion of the
prices of Masts for these twelve years to this day, in order to the
buying of some of [Mr.] Wood. And I bound it up in painted paper,
to lie by as a book for future use. So home and to supper and bed.

And alittle before and after we were in bed, we had much talk and
difference between us about my wife’s having a woman; which I
seemed much angry at that she should go so far in it without
consideration and my being consulted with. So to sleep.
