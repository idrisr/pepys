Slept pretty well, and my wife waked to ring the bell to call up
our maids to the washing about 4 a-clock and I was, and she, angry
that our bell did not wake them sooner; but I will get a bigger bell.
So we to sleep again till 8 a-clock. Atnoon, Lewellin coming to me,
I took him and Deane, and there met my uncle Thomas and we
dined together. But was vexed that it being washing-day, we had
no meat dressed; but sent to the cook’s and my people had so little
wit to send in our meat from abroad in the cook’s dishes, which
were marked with the name of the Cooke upon them; by which, if
they observed anything, they might know it was not my own
dinner. Finding myself beginning to be troubled with wind, as I
used to be, and with pain in making water, [at night] I took a couple
of pills that I had by me of Mr. Hollyards.
