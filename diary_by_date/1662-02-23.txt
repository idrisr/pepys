Lords day. My cold being increased, I stayed at home all day,
pleasing myself with my dining-room, now graced with pictures,
and reading of Dr. Fullers worthys. So I spent the day; and at night
comes Sir W.. Pen and supped and talked with me. This day, by
God’s mercy I am 29 years of age, and in very good health and like
to live and get an estate; and if] havea heart to be contented, Ithink I
may reckon myself as happy a man as any is in the world— for which
God be praised. So to prayers and bed.
