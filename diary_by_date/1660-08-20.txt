Office day. As Sir W. Pen andI were walking in the garden, a
messenger came to me from the Duke of Yorke to fetch me to the
Lord Chancellor, but my Lord Chancellor being gone to the House
of Lords, I went thither and (there being a law case tried before
them this day) got in; and there stayed all the morning, seeing their
manner of sitting on Woolpacks, &c., which I never did before.
After the House was up, I spoke to my Lord and had order from
him to come to him at night. The afternoon at the Privy Seale;
where reckoning with Mr. Moore,’ he had got rool for me
together, which I was glad of, guessing that the profits of this
month to me would come to rool. In the evening I went all alone to
drink at Mrs. Harpers, where I found Mrs. Crisps daughter, with
whom and her friends I stayed and drank. And so with W. Ewre by
coach to Worcester house, where I light, sending him home with
the rool that I received today. Here I stayed and saw my Lord
Chancellor come into his Great Hall, where wonderful how much
company there was to expect him at a Seale. Before he would begin
any business, he took my papers of the state of the debts of the fleet
and there viewed them before all the people and did give me his
advice privately how to order things to get as much money as we
can of the parliament. That being done, I went home, where I find
all my things come home from sea, of which I was glad, though
many of my things are quite spoiled with mould, by reason of lying
so long a-shipboard and my cabin being not tight. I spent much
time to dispose of them tonight, and so to bed.
