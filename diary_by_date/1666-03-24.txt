After dinner I to Whitehall to a committee for Tanger, where
the Duke of York was — and I acquitted myself well in what I had to
do. After the committee up, I had occasion to fallow the Duke into
his lodgings into a chamber where the Duchesse was sitting to have
her picture drawn by Lilly, who was there at work. But I was well
pleased to see that there was nothing near so much resemblance of
her face in his work, which is now the second, ifnot the third time,
as there was of my wife’s at the very first time. Nor doI think at last
it can be like, the lines not being in proportion to those of her face.
So home and to the office, where late; and so to bed.
