Lords day. My wife and I at church, our pew filled (which
vexed me at her confidence) with Mrs. Backwell and six more that
she brought with her. Dined at home, and W. Batelier with us, and
I all the afternoon drawing up a foul draft of my petition to the
Duke of York about my eyes, for leave to spend three or four
months out of the office, drawing it so as to give occasion to a
voyage abroad; which I did to my pretty good liking. And then
with my wife to Hyde park, where a good deal of company, and
good weather; and so home to supper and to bed.
