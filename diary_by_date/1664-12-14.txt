Up; and after a while at the office, I abroad in several places;
among other, to my booksellers and there spoke for several books
against New Year’s day, I resolving to lay out about 7 or 8/, God
having given me some profit extraordinary of late. And bespoke
also some plate, spoons, and forks. I pray God keep me from too
great expenses, though these will still be pretty good money. Then
to the Change; and I home to dinner, where Creed (and Mr.
Czesare, my boy’s lute master, who plays endeed mighty finely);
and after dinner I abroad, parting from Creed, and away to and fro,
laying-out or preparing for laying-out more money, but Ihope and
resolve not to exceed therein. And tonight spoke for some fruit for
the country for my father against Christmas; and where should I do
it but at the pretty woman’s that use to stand at the door in
Fanchurch street —I having a mind to know her. So home and late at
my office, evening reckonings with Shergoll and so away home to
supper and to bed, not being very well through my taking cold of
late and so troubled with some wind.
