1666-09-23

Sunday. Up, and after being trimmed, all the morning at the
office, with my people about me, till about one a-clock; and then
home, and my people with me, and Mr. Wayth; and eat a bit of
victuals in my old closet, now my little dining-room, which makes
a pretty room; and my house being so clean makes me mightily
pleased, but only I do lack Mercer or somebody in the house to sing
with. As soon as eat a bit, Mr. Wayth and I by water to Whitehall,
and there at Sir G. Carteret’s lodgings Sir W. Coventry met, and we
did debate the whole business of our account to the Parliament —
where it appears to us that the charge of the war, from September 1
1664 to this Michaelmas, will have been but 3200000!/, and we have
paid in that time somewhat about 2200000/; so that we owe above
gooooo!: but our method of accounting, though it cannot I believe
be far wide from the mark, yet will not abide a strict examination if
the Parliament should be troublesome. Here happened apretty
question of Sir W. Coventry, whether this account of ours will not
put my Lord Treasurer to a difficulty to tell what is become of all
the money the Parliament hath given in this time for the war, which
hath amounted to about 4000000! — which nobody there could
answer; but I perceive they did doubt what his answer could be.

Having done, and taken from Sir W. Coventry the minutes of a
letter to my Lord Treasurer, Wayth and I back again to the office.
And thence back down to the water with my wife, and landed him
in Southworke, and my wife andI for pleasure to Foxhall, and there
eat and drank, and so back home; and I to my office till midnight,
drawing the letter we are to send with our account to my Lord
Treasurer; and that being done to my mind, I home to bed.
