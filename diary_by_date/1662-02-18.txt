Lay long in bed. Then up to the office (we having changed our
days to Tuseday and Saturday in the morning and Thursday at
night); and by and by, with Sir Wm. Pen, Mr. Kenard and others to
Survey his house again and to contrive for the alterations there —
which will be handsome | think. Having agreed with Sir Wm. Pen
and my wife to meet them at the Opera, and finding by my walking
in the streets, which were everywhere full of brickbattes and tyeles
flung down by the extraordinary Winde the last night (such as hath
not been in memory before, unless at the death of the late
Protector), that it was dangerous to go out of doors; and hearing
how several persons have been killed today by the fall of things in
the streets and that the pageant in Fleetstreete is most of it blown
down, and hath broke down part of several houses, among others
Dick Brigdens, and that one Lady Sanderson, a person of Quality in
Covent garden, was killed by the fall of the house in her bed last
night, I sent my boy home to forbid them to go forth.
