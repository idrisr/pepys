Lords day. At church, alone in the pew, in the morning. In the
afternoon, by water I carried my wife to Westminster; where she
went to take leave of her father and I to walk in the parke, which is
now every day more and more pleasant, by the new works upon it.
Here meeting with Laud Crispe, I took him to the further end and
sot under a tree in the corner and there sung some songs; he singing
well, but no skill and so would sing false sometimes.
