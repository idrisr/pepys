Upand to my office— whither by and by came John Noble, my
father’s old servant, to speak with me. I smelling the business, took
him home; and there all alone he told me how he had been
serviceable to my brother Tom in the business of his getting his
servant, an ugly jade, Margeret, with child. She was brought to bed
in St. Sepulchers parish of two children. One is dead, the other is
alive; her name Elizabeth and goes by the name of Taylor, daughter
to John Taylor. It seems Tom did a great while trust one Crawly
with the business, who daily got money of him; and at last, finding
himself abused, he broke the matter to J. Noble — upon a vow of
secrecy. Toms first plot was to go on the other side the water and
give a beggar-woman something to take the child. They did once
go, but did nothing, J. Noble saying that seven year hence the
mother might come to demand the child and force him to produce
it, or to be suspected of murther. Then, I think it was, that they
consulted and got one Cave, a poor pensioner in St. Brides parish,
to take it, giving him s/; he thereby promising to keep it for ever,
without more charge to them. The parish hereupon indite the man
Cave for bringing this child upon the parish, and by Sir Rd.
Browne is sent to the Counter.
