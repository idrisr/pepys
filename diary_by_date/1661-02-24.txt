Sunday. Mr. Mills made an excellent sermon in the morning
against Drunkennesse that ever I heard in my life. I dined at home.
Another good one of his in the afternoon. My Valentine had her
fine gloves on at church today that I did give her. After sermon my
wife and I into Sir W. Batten’s and sat awhile. Then home — I to
read. Then to supper and to bed.
