To Hales’s and there sat till almost quite dark upon working
my gowne, whichI hired to be drawn [in] — an Indian gown, and I
do see all the reason to expect a most excellent picture of it. Thus
home, and to my private accounts in my chamber till past one in the
morning; and so to bed — with my head full of thoughts for my
evening of all my accounts tomorrow, the latter end-of the month;
in which God give me good issue, for I never was in such a
confusion in my life, and that in great sums.
