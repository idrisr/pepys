By the way, Ihear today that my boy Waynman hath behaved
himself so with Mr. Davis, that they have got him put into a
Berbados ship to be sent away; and though he sends to me to get a
release for him, I will not, out of love to the boy; for I doubt to keep
him here were to bring him to the gallows.
