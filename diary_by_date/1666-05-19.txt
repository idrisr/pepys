Up, and to the office all the morning. At noon took Mr.
Deane (lately come to town) home with me to dinner; and there,
after giving him some reprimendes and good advice about his
deportment in the place where by my interest he is at Harwich, and
then declaring my resolution of being his friend still — we did then
fall to discourse about his ship Rupert, built by him there; which
succeeds so well, as he hath got great honour by it, and I some by
recommending him — the King, Duke, and everybody saying it is
the best ship that was ever built. And then he fell to explain to me
his manner of casting the draught of water which a ship will draw
beforehand — which isa secret the King and all admire in him; and he
is the first that hath come to any certainty beforehand of foretelling
the draught of water of a ship before she be launched.
