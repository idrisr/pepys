Office day. To the office till late at night; and so Sir W. Pen, the
Comptroller and I to the Dolphin, where we found Sir W. Batten
(who is seldom a night from hence); and there we did drink a great
Quantity of Sack. And did tell many merry stories, and in good
humours we were all. So home and to bed.
