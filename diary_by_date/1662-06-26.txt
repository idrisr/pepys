Up and took phisique, but such as to go abroad with, only to
loosen me, for I am bound. So to the office — and there all the
morning, setting till noon; and then took Comissioner Pett home
with me to dinner, where my stomach was turned when my
sturgeon came to table, upon which I saw very many little worms
creeping, which I suppose was through the staleness of the pickle.
He being gone, comes Mr. Nicholson, my old fellow-student at
Magdalen, and we played three or four things upon violin and
Basse; and so parted, andI to my office till night; and then came Mr.
Sheply and Creede in order to setting some accounts of my Lord
right; and so to bed.
