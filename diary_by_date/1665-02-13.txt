Up, and to St. James’s; did our usual business before the
Duke. Thence I to Westminster and by water (taking Mr. Stapely
the rope-maker by the way) to his rope-ground and to Limehouse,
there to see the manner of Stoves, and did excellently inform myself
therein. And coming home, did go on board Sir W. Petty’s
experiment — which is a brave roomy vessel — and I hope may do
well. So went on shore to a Dutch [house] to drink some Mum, and
there light upon some Dutchmen, with whom we had good
discourse touching Stoveing and making of cables. But to see how
despicably they speak of us for our using so many hands more to do
anything then they do, they closing a cable with 20 that we use 60
men upon. Thence home and eat something; and then to my office,
where very late; and then to supper and to bed.
