Up and to my office, where all the morning. And Sir J.
Mennes and I dida little, and buta little, business at the office. So I
eate a bit of victuals at home and so abroad to several places, as my
booksellers; and lastly to Westminster hall — where I expected some
bands made me by Mrs. Lane. By and by Mrs. Lane comes; and my
bands not being done, she and Iparted and met at the Crowne in the
palace yard, where we eat (a chicken I sent for) and drank and were
mighty merry, and I had my full liberty of towsing her and doing
what I would but the last thing of all.
