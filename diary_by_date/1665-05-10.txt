Up betimes, and abroad to the Cockepitt, where the Duke!
did give Sir W. Batten and me an account of the late taking of eight
ships and of his* intent to come back to the Gunfleete with the fleet
presently — which creates us much work and haste therein, against
the fleet comes. So to Mr. Povy; and after discourse with him,
home and thence to the Guard in Southworke, there to get some
soldiers, by the Duke’s order, to go keep press-men on board our
ships. So to the Change and did much business; and then home to
dinner and there find my poor mother come out of the country
today, in good health; and I am glad to see her, but my business,
which I am sorry for, keeps me from paying the respect I ought to
her at her first coming — she being grown very weak in her
judgment, and doting again in her discourse, through age and some
trouble in her family. Left her and my wife to go abroad to buy
something, and then I to my office. In the evening, by appointment
to Sir W. Warren and Mr. Dering at a tavern hard by, with intent to
do some good upon their agreement in a great bargain of plank. So
home to my office again, and then to supper and to bed, my mother
being in bed already.
