Upand to the office, where sat till 2 a-clock; and then home to
dinner, whither by and by comes in Creede and he and I talked of
our Tanger business and do find that there is nothing in the world
done with true integrity but there is design along with it; as in my
Lord Rutherford, who desigas to have the profit of victualling of
the garrison himself, and others to have the benefit of making the
molle. So that ! am almost discouraged from coming any more to
the Committee, were it not that it will possibly hereafter bring me
to some acquaintance of the great men. Then to the office again,
where very busy till past 10 at night; and so home to supper and
bed.
