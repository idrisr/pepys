Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the
Change; where just before I came, the Swede that had told the King
and the Duke so boldly this great lie, of the Dutch flinging our men
back to back into the sea at Guinny, so perticularly and readily and
confidently, was whipped round the Change —he confessing it a lie,
and that he did it in hopes to get something. Thence to the Sun
Taverne, and there dined with Sir W. Warren and Mr. Gifford the
merchant; and I hear how Nich. Colborne, that lately lived and got
a great estate there, is gone to live like a prince in the country; and
that this Wadlow, that did the like at the Devil by St. Dunstanes,
did go into the country, and there spent almost all he had got, and
hath now choused this Colborne out of his house, that he might
come to his old trade again. Thence home to the office, where
despatch much business; at night late home and to clean myself with
warm water; my wife will have me, because she doth herself; and so
to bed.
