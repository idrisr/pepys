Up;and my new Taylor, Langford, comes and takes measure
of me for a new black cloth suit and cloak. And Ithink he will prove
a very careful fellow and will please me well. Thence to attend my
Lord Peterborough in bed and give him an account of yesterday’s
proceeding with Povey. I perceive I labour in a business will bring
me little pleasure; but no matter, I shall do the King some service.
Thence to the Coffee-house and to the Change a while. News
uncertain how the Dutch proceed; some say for, some say against a
warr. The plague encreases at Amsterdam. So home to dinner; and
after dinner to my office, where very late, till my eyes (which begin
to fail me nowadays by candlelight) begin to trouble me. Home at
night to supper and to bed.
