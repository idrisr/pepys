At the office all the morning; at noon dined at home; and then
my wife and Deb andI to the King’s playhouse and saw The Indian
Queene; but do not dote up[on] Nan Marshall’s acting therein as the
world talks of her excellence therein. Thence with my wife to buy
some linen, 13/ worth, for sheets, &c., at the new shop over against
the New Exchange, come out of London since the fire; who says his
and other tradesmen’s retail trade is so great here, and better then it
was in London, that they believe they shall not return, nor the City
be ever so great for retail as heretofore. Sohome and to my business
and supper, and to bed.
