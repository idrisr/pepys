All the morning with Mr. Berchenshaw and after him Mr.
Moore, in discourse of business; and at noon by Coach by
invitacion to my Uncle Fenners, whereI find his new wife, a pitiful,
old, ugly, illbread woman ina hatt, a midwife. Here were many of
his and as many of her relations, sorry mean people. And after
choosing our gloves, we all went over to the Three Crane taverne,
and (though the best room of the house) in such a narrow dogghole
we were crammed (and I believe we were near 40) that it made me
loathe my company and victuals; and a sorry poor dinner it was too.
