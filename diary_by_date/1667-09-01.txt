Lords day. Up, and betimes by water from the Tower; and
called at the Old Swan fora glass of strong water and sent word to
have little Michell and his wife come and dine with us today; and so,
taking in a gentleman and his lady that wanted a boat, I to
Westminster, setting them on shore at Charing cross; I to Mrs.
Martin’s, where I had two pair of cuffs which I bespoke, and there
did sit and talk with her and no mas, ella having aquellos upon her;
and here I did see her little girl my god-daughter, which will be
pretty. And there having stayedalittle, laway to Creeds chamber;
and when he was ready, away to Whitehall, where I met with
several people and had my fill of talk. So home by water to dinner,
where comes Pelling and young Michell and his wife, whom I have
not seen a great while, poor girl. And then comes Mr. How, and all
dined with me very merry; and spent all the afternoon, Pelling,
How, I and my boy, sing[ing] of Locke’s Response to the Ten
Commandments, which he hath set very finely, and was a good
while since sung before the King and spoilt in the performance —
which occasioned his printing them for his vindication, and are
excellent good. They parted, in the evening my wife and I to walk
in the garden; and there scolded a little, Ibeing doubtful that she had
received a couple of fine pinners (one of point-de-Gesne), which I
find she hath from some[one] or other of a present; but on the
contrary, I find she hath bought them for me to pay for them,
without my knowledge. This doth displease me much; but yet doth
so much please me better then if she had received them the other
way, that I was not much angry, but fell to other discourse; and so
to my chamber, and got her to read to me for saving of my eyes; and
then having gota great cold, I know not how, I to bed and lay ill at
ease all the night.
