Lay long in bed. This morning my wife and I went to
Paternoster Rowe and there we bought some greene watered
Moyre for a morning wastcoate. And after that we went to Mr.
Cades to choose some pictures for our house. After that my wife
went home and I to Popes head [Alley] and bought me an aggat
heafted knife which cost me ss. So home to dinner; and so to the
96
office all the afternoon. And at night to my viallin (the first time that
I have played on it since I came to this house) in my dining-roome;
and afterwards to my Lute there — and Itook much pleasure to have
the neighbours come forth into the yard to hear me. So downe to
supper and sent for the barber, who stayed so long with me that he
was locked into the house and we were fain to call up Griffith to let
him out. So up to bed, leaving my wife to wash herself and to do
other things against tomorrow to go to Court.
