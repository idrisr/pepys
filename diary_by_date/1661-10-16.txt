Inbed till 12 a-clock. This morning came several maids to my
wife to be hired; and at last she pitched upon one Nell, whose
mother, an old woman, came along with her; but would not be
hired under half'a year, which I am pleased at their drolenesse. This
day dined by appointment with me Dr. Tho. Pepys and my Cosen
Snow and my brother Tom, upona Fin of Ling and some Sounds,
neither of which did I ever know before, but most excellent meat
they are both, that in all my life I never eat the like fish. So after
dinner came in W. Joyce and eat and drank and were merry. So up
to my chamber and put all my papers at rights. And in the evening
our maid Mary (who was with us upon triall for a month) did take
her leave of us, going as we suppose to be married, for the maid
liked us and we her; but all she said was that she had a mind to live in
a tradesmans house where there was but one maid. So to supper and
to bed.
