With my wife to the King’s house, there to see Vulpone, a
most excellent play — the best I think I ever saw, and well acted. So
with Sir W. Penn home in his coach, and then to the office; so home
[to] supper and bed - resolving, by the grace of God, from this day
to fall hard to my business again, after some, a week or fortnight’s,
neglect.
