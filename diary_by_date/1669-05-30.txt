Whitsunday. By water to Whitehall, and thence to Sir W.
Coventry, where all the morning by his bedside, he being
indisposed; our discourse was upon the notes I had lately prepared
for commanders’ instructions; but concluded that nothing will
render them effectual without an amendment in the choice of them,
that they be seamen, and not gentlemen above the command of the
Admiral by the greatness of their relations at Court. Thence to
Whitehall and dined alone with Mr. Chevins his sister; whither by
and by came in Mr. Progers and Sir Tho. Allen, and by and by fine
Mrs. Wells, who is a great beauty and there Ihad my full gaze upon
her, to my great content, she being a woman of pretty conver-
sation. Thence to the Duke of York, who, with the officers of the
1022
Navy, made a good entrance on my draft of my new instructions to
commanders, as well as expressing his general [views] of a refor-
mation among them, as liking of my humble offers towards it.
Thence, being called by my wife, Mr. Gibson and we to the park,
whence the rain sent us suddenly home.
