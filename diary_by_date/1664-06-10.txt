Up, and by water to Whitehall and there to a Committee of
392
Tanger. And had occasion to see how my Lord Ashwith! deports
himself; which is very fine endeed, and itjoys my heart to see that
there is anybody looks so near into the King’s business as I perceive
he doth in this business of my Lord Peterborough’s accounts.
Thence into the parke and met and walked with Capt. Sylas Taylor,
my old acquaintance while I was of the Exchequer, and Dr. Whore
— talking of music and perticularly of Mr. Berchenshaw’s way,”
which Taylor magnifies mightily, and perhaps but what it deserves
— but not so easily to be understood as he and others make of it.
Thence home by water; and after dinner abroad to buy several
things: as, a map and powder and other small things; and so home
to my office, and in the evening with Capt. Taylor by water to our
Tanger ship; and so home well pleased, having received 261 profit
today of my bargain for this ship — which comforts me mightily,
though I confess my heart, what with my being out of order as to
my health and the fear Ihave of the money my Lord oweth me and I
stand endebted to him in, is much cast down of late. In the evening
home to supper and to bed.
