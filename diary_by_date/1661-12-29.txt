Lords day. Long in bed with my wife. And though I had
determined to go to dine with my wife at my Lady’s (chiefly to put
off dining with Sir W. Penn today, because Holmes dined there),
yet I could not get a coach time enough to go thither, and so I dined
at home and my brother Tom with me. And then a coach came and
I carried my wife to Westminster and she went to see Mrs. Hunt;
and I to the Abby and there meeting with Mr. Hooper, he took me
in among the Quire and there I sang with them their service.
