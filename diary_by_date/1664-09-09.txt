Up, and to put things in order against dinner, | out and bought
some things; among others, a dozen of Silver Salts. Home and to
the office, where some ofus met a little; and then home and at noon
comes my company - viz., Anth. and Will Joyce and their wifes -
my aunt James newly come out of Wales, and my Cosen Sarah
Gyles — her husband did not come, and by her I did understand
afterward that it was because he was not yet able to pay me the 4os.
she had borrowed a year ago of me. Iwas as merry asI could, giving
them a good dinner; but W. Joyce did so talk, that he made
everybody else Dumb, but only laugh at him. I forgot, there was
Mr. Harman and his wife. My aunt a very good harmelesse
423
woman. All their talk is of her and my two she-Cosen Joyces and
Will’s little boy Will (who was also here today) [going] down to
Brampton to my father’s next week — which will be trouble and
charge to them; but however, my father and mother desire to see
them, and so let them. They eyed mightily my great Cupboard of
plate, I this day putting my two Flaggons upon my table; and
endeed, it is a fine sight and better then ever I did hope to see of my
own. Mercer dined with us at table, this being her first dinner in my
house. After dinner left them and to Whitehall, where a small
Tanger committee; and so back again home and there my wife and
Mercer and Tom and Isat till 11 at night, singing and fiddling; anda
great joy it is to see me maister of so much pleasure in my house,
that it is, and will be still I hope, a constant pleasure to me to be at
home. The girle plays pretty well upon the Harpsicon, but only
ordinary tunes; but hath a good hand. Singsa
little, but hath a good
voyce and eare. My boy, a brave boy, sings finely and is the most
pleasant boy at present, while his ignorant boy’s tricks last, that
ever I saw. So to supper, and with great pleasure to bed.
