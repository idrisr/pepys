Lords day. Kept my bed all the morning, having laid a poultice
to my cods last night to take down the tumour there which I got
yesterday; which it did do, being applied pretty warm and soon
after the beginning of the swelling — and the pain was gone also. We
lay talking all the while; among other things, of religion, wherein I
am sorry so often to hear my wife talk of her being and resolving to
die a Catholique; and endeed, a small matter I believe would
absolutely turn her, which I am sorry for.
