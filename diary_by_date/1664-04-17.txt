Lords day. Up; and I put on my best cloth black suit and my
velvet cloak, and with my wife, in her best laced suit, to church —
where we have not been these nine or ten weeks. The truth is, my
jealousy hath hindered it, for fear she should see Pembleton. He was
here today, but I think sat so as he could not see her; which did
please me, God help me, mightily — though I know well enough
that in reason this is nothing but my ridiculous folly. Home to
dinner; and in the afternoon, after long consulting whether to go to
Woolwich or no to see Mr. Falconer, but endeed to prevent my
378
wife going to church, I did however go to church with her, where a
young simple fellow did preach—I slept soundly all the sermon; and
thence to Sir W. Pens, my wife and I, and there sat talking with him
and his daughter; and thence with my wife walked to my Uncle
Wights and there supped; where very merry, but I vexed to see
what charges the vanity of my aunt puts her husband to among her
friends,* and nothing at all among ours. Home and to bed.
