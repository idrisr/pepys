Atthe office all the morning. At noon Mr. Davenport, Phillips
and Mr. Wm. Bernard and Furbisher came by appointment and
dined with me, and we were very merry. After dinner, I to the
Wardrobe and there stayed talking with my Lady all the afternoon,
till late at night. Among other things, my Lady did mightily urge
me to lay out money upon my wife, which I perceived wasa
little
more earnest then ordinary; and so I seemed to be pleased with it
and do resolve to bestow a lace upon her — and what with this and
other talk, we were exceeding merry. So home at night.
