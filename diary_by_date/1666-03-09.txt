Up, and being ready, to the Cockepitt — to make a visit to the
Duke of Albemarle; and to my great joy find him the same man to
me that heretofore, which I was in great doubt of through my
negligence in not visiting of him a great while; and having now set
all to rights there, Iam in mighty ease in my mind, andI think shall
never suffer matters to run so far backward again, as I have done of
late with reference to my neglecting him and Sir W. Coventry.
Thence by water down to Deptford, where I met my Lord
Brouncker and Sir W. Batten by agreement, and to measuring Mr.
Castles new third-rate ship, which is to be called the Defyance. And
here I had my end, in saving the King some money and getting
myself some experience in knowing how they do measure ships.
Thence I left them and walked to Redriffe, and there taking water,
was overtaken by them in their boat, and so they would have me in
with them to Castle’s house, where my Lady Batten and Madame
Williams were, and there dined and a deal of doings. I had a good
dinner, and counterfeit mirth and pleasure with them, but had but
little, thinking how I neglected my business. Anon all home to Sir
W. Batten’s, and there, Mrs. Knipp coming, we did spend the
evening] together very merry, she and I singing; and God forgive
me, I do still see that my nature is not to be quite conquered, but
will esteem pleasure above all things; though, yet in the middle of
it, it hath reluctancy after my business, which is neglected by my
following my pleasure. However, music and women I cannot but
give way to, whatever my business is. They being gone, I to the
office a while, and so home to supper and to bed.
