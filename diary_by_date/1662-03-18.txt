All the morning at the office with Sir W. Pen. Dined at home,
and Luellin and Blurton with me. After dinner to the office again,
where Sir George Carteret and we stayed awhile, and then Sir W.
Pen and I on board some of the ships now fitting for East Indys and
Portugall, to see in what forwardness they are. And so back home
again.
