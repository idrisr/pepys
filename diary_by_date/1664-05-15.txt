Lords day. Rose, and as Ihad intended without reference to this
pain, took physic and it wrought well with me. My wife lying from
me tonight, the first time she did in the same house ever since we
were married Ithink (unless while my father was in town that he lay
with me); she took physic also today, and both of our physics
wrought well; so we passed our time today, our physic having done
working, with some pleasure talking; but I was not well, for I could
make no water yet but a drop or two with great pain, nor break any
wind. In the evening came Mr. Vernatty to see me and discourse
about my Lord Peterborough’s business. And also my Uncle Wight
and Norbury; but I took no notice nor showed any different
385
countenance to my Uncle Wight or he to me, for all that he carried
himself so basely to my wife the last week — but will take time to
make my use of it. So being exceeding hot, to bed and slept well.
