Up, it being a great frost upon the snow; and we sat all the
morning upon Mr. Creedes accounts, wherein Ididhim some service
and some disservice. At noon he dined with me and we sat all the
afternoon together, discoursing of ways to get money, which] am
now giving myself wholly up to; and in theevening he wentaway and
Ito my office, concluding all matters concerning our great letter, so
long in doing, to my Lord Treasurer, till almost one in the morning;
and then home with my mind much eased, and so to bed.
