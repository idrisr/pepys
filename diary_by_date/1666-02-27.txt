Up, and after a harsh word or two, my wife and I good
friends; and so up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon,
late to dinner, my wife gone out to Hales’s about her picture. And
after dinner I after her, and do mightily like her picture and think it
will be as good as my Lady Peters’s. So home, mightily pleased,
and there late at business; and so home and set down my three last
days’ Journalls, and so to bed — overjoyed to thinkof the pleasure of
$92
the last Sunday and yesterday, and my ability to bear the charge of
those pleasures — and with profit too — by obliging my Lord and
reconciling Sir G. Carteret’s family.
