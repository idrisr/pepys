Up and to read a
little; and by and by, the Carver coming, I
directed him how to make me a neat head for my viall that is
making. About 10 a-clock my wife and I, not without some
discontent, abroad by coach, and I set her at her father’s; but their
condition is such that she will not let me see where they live — but
goes by herself when I am out of sight. Thence I to my brother’s,
taking care for a passage for my wife the next week in a coach to my
father’s. Thence to Pauls churchyard, where I find several books
ready bound for me; among others, the new Concordance of the
Bible, which pleases me much and is a book I hope to make good
use of.
