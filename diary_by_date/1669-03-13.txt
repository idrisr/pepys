Up and to the Tower to see Sir W. Coventry, and with him
talking of business of the Navy all alone an hour, he taking physic.
And so away to the office, where all the morning; and then home to
dinner with my people and so to the office again. And there all the
afternoon till night, when comes by mistake my cousin Turner and
her two daughters (which loves such freaks) to eat some anchoves
and ham of bacon with me, by mistake instead of noon at dinner,
when I expected them; but however, Ihad done my business before
they came and so was in good humour enough to be with them; and
so home to them to supper, and pretty merry — being pleased to see
Betty Turner, which hath something mighty pretty. But that
which put me in good humour, both at noon and night, is the fancy
that I am this day made a Captain of one of the King’s ships. Mr.
Wren having this day sent me the Duke of York’s commission to be
Captain of the Jerzy, in order to my being of a Court Martiall for
examining the loss of the Defyance, and other things — which doth
give me occasion of much mirth, and may be of some use to me; at
least, I shall get a little money by it for the time I have it, it being
designed that I must really be a Captain to be able to sit in this
Court. They stayed till about 8 at night, and then away; and my
wife to read to me, and then to bed in mighty good humour, but for
my eyes.
