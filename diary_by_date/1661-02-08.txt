At the office all the morning. At noon to the Exchange. Here I
met with many sea-commanders; and among others, Capt. Cuttle,
and Curtis and Mootham; and I went to the Fleece tavern to drink
and there we spent till 4 a-clock telling stories of Algier and the
manner of the life of Slaves! there; and truly, Capt. Mootham and
Mr. Dawes (who have been both slaves there) did make me full
acquainted with their condition there. As, how they eat nothing but
bread and water. At their redempcion, they pay so much for the
water that they drink at the public fountaynes during their being
slaves. How they are beat upon the soles of the feet and bellies at the
Liberty of their Padron. How they are all at night called into their
master’s Bagnard, and there they lie. How the poorest men do use
their slaves best. How some rogues do live well, ifthey do endent to
bring their masters in so much a week by their industry or theft; and
then they are put to no other work at all. And theft there is counted
no great crime at all. Thence to Mr. Rawlinsons, having met my
old friend Dick Scobell, and there I drank a great deal with him; and
so home and to bed betimes, my head akeing.
