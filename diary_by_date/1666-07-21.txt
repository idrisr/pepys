Up, and to the office, where all the morning sitting. At noon
walked in the garden with Comissioner Pett (newly come to town),
who tells me how infinite the disorders are among the commanders
and all officers of the fleet— no discipline— nothing but swearing and
cursing, and everybody doing what they please; and the Generalls,
understanding no better, suffer it, to the reproaching of this Board
or whoever it will be. He himself hath been challenged twice to the
field, or something as good, by Sir Edwd. Spragg and Captain
Seamour; he tells me the captains carry, for all the late orders, what
men they please. Demand and consume what provisions they
please. So that he fears, and I do no less, that God Almighty
can[not] bless us while we keep in this disorder that we are in. He
observing to me too, that there is no man of counsel or advice in the
fleet; and the truth is, the gentlemen Captains will undo us, for they
are not to be kept in order, their friends about the King and Duke
and their own houses is so free, that it is not for any person but the
Duke himself to have any command over them. He gone, I to
dinner, and then to the office, where busy all the afternoon.
