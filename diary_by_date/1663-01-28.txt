Up, and all the morning at my office doing business — and at
home seeing my painters’ work measured. So to dinner and abroad
with my wife, carrying her to Unthankes, where she lights and I to
my Lord Sandwiches, whomIfind missing his ague fit today and is
254
pretty well, playing at dice (and by this I see how time and example
may alter a man; he being now acquainted with all sorts of pleasures
and vanities which heretofore he never thought of nor loved, or it
may be, hath allowed) with Ned Pickering and his page Loud.
Thence to Wottons the shoemaker and there bought another pair of
new boots for the other Ibought my last journey, that would not fit
me. And here I drank with him and his wife, a pretty woman, they
broaching a vessel of Cyder a-purpose for me. So home, and there
find my wife come home and seeming to cry; for bringing home in
a coach her new Ferradin waistcoat, in Cheapside a man asked her
whether that was the way to the tower, and while she was
answering him, another on the other side snatched away her bundle
out of her lap, and could not be recovered — but ran away with it —
which vexes me cruelly, but it cannot be helped. So to my office and
there till almost 12 at night with Mr. Lewes, learning to understand
the manner of a pursers account — which is very hard and little
understood by my fellow-officers, and yet mighty necessary. So at
last with great content broke up, and home to supper and bed.
