A solemne Fast for the King’s murther. And we were forced to
keep it more then we would have done, having forgot to take any
victuals into the house. I to church in the forenoon, and Mr. Mills
made a good sermon upon David’s heart smiting him for cutting off
the garment of Saule. Home and whiled away some of the
afternoon at home, talking with my wife. So to my office, and all
alone making up my month’s accounts; which to my great trouble I
find that I am got no further then 640] — but I have had great
expenses this month. I pray God the next may bealittle better, as I
hope it will. In the evening my [Navy] manuscript is brought
home, handsomely bound to my full content; and nowI think I
have a better collection in reference to the Navy, and shall have by
the time Ihave filled it, then any of my predecessors. So home to eat
something, such as we have, bread and butter and milk; and so to
bed.
