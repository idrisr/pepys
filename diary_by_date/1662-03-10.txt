At the office, doing business all the morning. And my wife
being gone to buy some things in the City, I dined with Sir W.
Batten; and in the afternoon met Sir W. Pen at the Treasury Office
and there paid off the Guift— where late at night, and so called in and
eat a bit at Sir W. Battens again; and so home and to bed, tomorrow
being washing-day.
