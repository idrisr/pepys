Up, and to my office, where busy all the morning. At noon
with Creed to dinner to Trinity house to dinner, where a very good
dinner among the old Sokers — where and extraordinary discourse
of the manner of the loss of the Royall Oake, coming home from
Bantam, upon the rocks of Scilly; many passages therein being very
extraordinary — and if I-can, I will get it in writing. Thence with
Creed to Gresham College — where I had been by Mr. Povy the last
week proposed to be admitted a member; and was this day
admitted, by signing a book and being taken by the hand by the
President, my Lord Brunkard, and some words of admittance said
to me. But it is a most acceptable thing to hear their discourses and
see their experiments; which was this day upon the nature of fire,
and how it goes out ina place where the ayre is not free, and sooner
out where the ayre is exhausted; which they showed by an engine
on purpose. After this being done, they to the Crowne tavern
behind the Change, and there my Lord and most of the company to
a club supper — Sir P. Neale, Sir R. Murrey, Dr. Clerke, Dr.
Whistler, Dr. Goddard, and others of most eminent worth. Above
all, Mr. Boyle today was at the meeting, and above him Mr.
Hooke, who is the most, and promises the least, of any man in the
world that ever I saw. Here, excellent discourses till 10 at night, and
then home.
