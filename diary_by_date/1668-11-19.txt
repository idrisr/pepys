Up, and at the office all the morning, with my heart full ofjoy
to think in what a safe condition all my matters now stand between
my wife and Deb and me; and at noon, running upstairs to see the
upholsters, who are at work upon hanging my best room and
setting up my new bed, I find my wife sitting sad in the dining-
room; which inquiring into the reason of, she begun to call me all
the false, rotten-hearted rogues in the world, letting me understand
that I was with Deb yesterday; which, thinking impossible for her
ever to understand, I did a while deny; but at last did, for the ease of
my mind and hers, and for ever to discharge my heart of this wicked
business, I did confess all; and above-stairs in our bed-chamber
there, I did endure the sorrow of her threats and vows and curses all
the afternoon. And which was worst, she swore by all that was
good that she would slit the nose of this girl, and be gone herself this
very night from me; and did there demand 3 or 400l of me to buy
my peace, that she might be gone without making any noise, or else
protested that she would make all the world know of it. So, with
most perfect confusion of face and heart, and sorrow and shame, in
the greatest agony in the world, I did pass this afternoon, fearing
963
that it will never have an end; but at last I did call for W. Hewers,
who I was forced to make privy now to all; and the poor fellow did
cry like a child [and] obtained what I could not, that she would be
pacified, upon condition that I would agree it under my hand never
to see or speak to Deb while I live, as I did before of Pierce and
Knepp; and whichIdid also, God knows, promise for Deb too, but
I have the confidence to deny it, to the perjuring of myself. So
before it was late, there was, beyond my hopes as well as desert, a
tolerable peace; and so to supper, and pretty kind words, and to
bed, and there yo did hazer con ella to her content; and so with some
rest spent the night in bed, being most absolutely resolved, ifever I
can maister this bout, never to give her occasion while Ilive of more
trouble of this or any other kind, there being no curse in the world
so great as this of the difference between myself and her; and
therefore I do by the grace of God promise never to offend her
more, and did this night begin to pray to God upon my knees alone
in my chamber; which God knows I cannot yet do heartily, but I
hope God will give me the grace more and more every day to fear
Him, and to be true to my poor wife. This night the Upholsters did
finish the hanging of my best chamber, but my sorrow and trouble
is so great about this business, that put me out of all joy in looking
upon it or minding how it was.
