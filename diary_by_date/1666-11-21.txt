Up; with Sir W. Batten to Charing cross, and thence I to wait
on Sir Ph. Howard, whomIfind dressing himself in his night-
gown and Turban like a Turke; but one of the finest persons: that
ever I saw in my life. He had several gentlemen of his own waiting
on him, and one playing finely on the gittarr. He discourses as well
as ever I heard man, in few words and handsome. He expressed all
kindness to Balty, whom I told how sick he is. He says that before
he comes to be mustered again, he must bring certificate of his
swearing the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and having taken
the sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England. This
I perceive is imposed on all — and he will be ready to do. I pray God
he may have his health again to be able to do it. Being mightily
satisfied with his civility, I away to Westminster hall; and there
walked with several people, and all the discourse is about some
trouble in Scotland I heard of yesterday, but nobody can tell the
truth of it. And thence I to the Excize Office about some tallies, and
then to the Exchange, where I did much business; and so home to
dinner, and then to the office, where busy all the afternoon till
night; and then home to supper, and after supper an hour reading to
my wife and brother something in Chaucer with great pleasure, and
so to bed.
