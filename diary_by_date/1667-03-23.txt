At the office all the morning, where Sir W. Penn came, being
returned from Chatham from considering the means of fortifying
the River Medway, bya chain at the stakes and ships laid there, with
guns to keep the enemy from coming up to burn our ships — all our
care now being [to] fortify ourselfs against their invading us. At
noon home to dinner, and then to the office all the afternoon again —
where Mr. Moore came, who tells me that there is now no doubt
made of a peace being agreed on, the King having declared this
week in council that they wouid treat at Bredagh. He gone, I to my
office, where busy late; and so to supper and to bed — vexed with
our maid Luce, our cook-maid, who is a good drudging servant in
everything else and pleases us, but that she will be drunk, and hath
been so last night and all this day, that she could not make clean the
house — my fear is only fire.
