Inthe morning, Tom, that was my Lord’s foot-boy, came to
see me and had ros. of me of the moneyof his which I have to keep
of his. So that now I have but 35s. more of his. Then came Mr. Hill
the instrument maker, and I consulted with him about the altering
of my lute and my viall. After him, I went into my study and made
up my accounts, and find that I am about 4ol beforehand in the
world. And that is all. So to my office and from thence brought Mr.
Hawly home with me to dinner; and after dinner wrote a
letter to
Mr. Downing about his business — and gave it Hawly; and so Iwent
to Mr. Gunings to his weekly fast; and after sermon, meeting there
with Mr. L’impertinent, we went and walked in the park till it was
dark. I played on my pipe at the Echo, and then drank a cup of ale at
Jacob’s. So to Westminster hall, and he with me; where I heard that
some of the members of the House was gone to meet with some of
the secluded members and Gen. Monke in the City. Hence we went
to Whitehall, thinking to hear more news. Where I met with Mr.
Hunt, who told me how Monke had sent for all his goods that he
had here into the City. And yet again, he told me that some of the
members of the House had this day laid in firing into their lodgings
at Whitehall for a good while. So that we are at a great stand to think
what will become of things, whether Monke will stand to the
Parliament or no. Hence, Monsieur Limpertinent and I to Harpers
and there drank a cup or two to the King, and to his fair sister
Frances good health, of whom we had much discourse of her not
being much the worse for the smallpox which she had this last
summer. So home and to bed. (This day we were invited to my
uncle Fenners wedding feast, but went not, this being the 27th
year.)
