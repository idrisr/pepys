Long with Mr. Berchenshaw in the morning at my Musique
practice, finishing my song of Gaze not on swans in two parts, which
pleases me well. And I did give him s/ for this month or five weeks
that he hath taught me, which is a great deal of money and troubled
me to part with it. After supper, called Will up and chid him before
my wife for refusing to go to church with the maids yesterday, and
telling his mistress that he would not be made a slave of — which
vexes me. So to bed.
