Lords day. Lay long in bed; then up and took physique, Mr.
Hollyard[’s]. But it being cold weather and myself negligent of
myself, I fear I took cold and stopped the working of it. But I feel
myself pretty well. All the morning looking over my old wardrobe
and laying by things for my brother John and my father, by which I
shall leave myself very bare in clothes, but yet as much as Ineed and
the rest would but spoil in the keeping. Dined, my wife and I, very
well. All the afternoon my wife and I above, and then the boy and I
to singing of psalms, and then came in Mr. Hill and he sung with us
a while; and he being gone, the boy and | again to the singing of Mr.
Porter’s mottets, and it is a great joy to me that I am come to this
condition, to maintain a person in the house able to give me such
pleasure as this boy doth by his thorough understand of music, as he
sing anything at first sight. Mr. Hill came to tell me that he had gota
gentlewoman for my wife, one Mrs. Ferrabosco, that sings most
admirably. I seemed glad of it; but I hear she is too gallant for me
and am not sorry that I misse her. ThenI to the office, setting some
papers right; and so home to supper and to bed — after prayers.
