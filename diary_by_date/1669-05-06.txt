Upand by coach to W. Coventry’s; but he gone out, Iby water
back to the office and there all the morning; then to dinner and then
the office again; and anon with my wife by coach to take the ayre, it

our journey and our condition of doing it in our own coach; and so
home and to walk in the garden; and so to supper and to bed, my
eyes being bad with writing my journall, part of it, tonight.
