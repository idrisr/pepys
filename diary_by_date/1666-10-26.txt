Up, and all the morning and most of the afternoon within
doors, beginning to set my accounts in order from before this Fire, I
being behindhand with them ever since. And this day I got most of
my tradesmen to bring in their bills, and paid them. Dined at home,
and busy again after dinner; and then abroad by water to
Westminster hall, where I walked till the evening; and then out, the
first time I ever was abroad with Doll Lane, to the Dog tavern, and
there drank with her — a bad face, but good-bodied girl. Did
nothing but salute and play with her, and talk; and thence away by
coach home, and so to doa little more in my accounts, and then to
supper and to bed.
