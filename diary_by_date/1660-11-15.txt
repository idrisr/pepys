To Westminster, and it being very cold upon the Water, I
went all alone to the Sun and drank a draught of mulled White wine.
To my Lord’s — where I found my Lord within and stayed hearing
him and Mr. Childe playing upon my Lord’s new Organ — the first
time I ever heard it. My Lord did this day show me the Kings
picture which was done in Flanders, that the King did promise my
Lord before he ever saw him and that we did expect to have had at
sea before the King came to us. But it came but today. And endeed
it is the most pleasant and the most like him that ever I saw picture
in my life.’ As dinner was coming to table, my wife came hither
and I got her carried into my Lady (who took phisique today and
was just now hiring of a French maid that was with her, and could
not understand one another till my wife came to interpret): here I
did leave my wife to dine with my Lord (the first time that ever he

did take notice of her as my wife, and did seem to have a great
esteem for her); and did myself walk homewards (hearing that Sir
W. Pen was gone before in a coach) to overtake him. To Sir W.
Batten’s to dinner, he having a couple of servants married today;
and so there was a great number of Merchants and others of good
Quality, on purpose after dinner to make an offering, which when
dinner was done, we did;-and I did give ros. and no more, though I
believe most of the rest did give more and did believe that I did so
too.
