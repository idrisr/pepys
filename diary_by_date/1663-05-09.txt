Up betimes and to my office; whither sooner then ordinary
comes Mr. Hater, desiring to speak a word to me alone, which |
was from the disorder of his countenance amused* at; and so the
poor man begun telling me that by Providence being the last Lord’s
day at a meeting of some Friends upon doing of their duties, they
were surprized and he carried to the Counter, but afterward
released; however, hearing that Sir W. Batten doth hear of [it], he
thought it good to give me an account of it, lest it might tend to any
prejudice to me. I was extraordinary surprized with it and troubled
for him, knowing that now it is out, it is impossible for me to
conceal it, or keep him in imployment under me without danger to
myself. I cast about all I could and did give him the best advice I
could; desiring to know if I should promise that he would not for
the time to come commit the same, he told me he desired that I
would rather forbear to promise that; for he durst not do it,
what[ever] God in His providence shall do with him; and that for
my part, he did bless God and thank me for all the love and kindness
I have showed him hitherto. I could not, without tears in my eyes,
discourse with him further, but at last did pitch upon telling the
truth of the whole to Mr. Coventry as soon as I could; and to that
end did use means to prevent Sir W. Batten (who came to town last
night) from going to that end today, lest he might doe it to Sir G.
Carteret or Mr. Coventry before me- which I did prevail, and kept
him at the office all the morning. At noon dined at home with a
heavy heart for the poor man.
