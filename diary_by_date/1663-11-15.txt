Lords day. I dined by myself; and in the afternoon to my office
again and there drew up a letter to my Lord, stating to him what the
321
world talks concerning him, and leaving it to him; and myself to be
thought of by him as he pleases, but Ihave done but my duty init. I
wait Mr. Moores coming for his advice about sending it. So home
to supper to my wife, myself finding myself, by cold got last night,
beginning to have some pain; which grieves me much in my mind,
to see to what a weakness I am come. This day being our Queenes
birthday, the guns of the tower went all off. And in the evening the
Lord Mayor sent from church to church to order the constables to
cause bonefires to be made in every street — which methinks is a
poor thing to be forced to be commanded. After a good supper with
my wife, and hearing on the maids read in the Bible, we to prayers
and to bed.
