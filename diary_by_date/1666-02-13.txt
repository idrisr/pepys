Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon to the Change,
and thence, after business, dined at the Sheriffes (Hooker), being
carried by Mr. Lethulier; where to my heart’s content I met his
wife, a most beautiful fat woman. But all the house melancholy
upon the sickness of a daughter of the house in childbed, Mr.
Vaughans lady — so all of them undressed; but however, this lady a
very fine woman — I hada salute of her; and after dinner some
discourse, the Sheriff and I, about a parcel of
tallow Iam buying for
the office of him, I away home, and there at the office all the
afternoon till late at night, and then away home to supper and to
bed. Ill news this night, that the plague is encreased this week, and
in many places else about the town, and at Chatham and elsewhere.
This day, my wife wanting a chambermaid, with much ado got our
oldlittle Jane to be found out, who came to see her; and hath lived
all this while in one place, but is so well, that we will not desire her
removal; but are mighty glad to see the poor wench, who is very
well, and doth well.
