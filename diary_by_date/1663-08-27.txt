Up, after much pleasant talk with my wife andalittle that
vexes me, for I see that she is confirmed in it that all that I do is by
design, and that my very keeping of the house in dirt,' and the
doing of this and anything else in the house, is but to find her
imployment to keep her within and from mindingofher pleasure.
In which, though I am sorry to see she minds it, is true enough in a
great degree.
