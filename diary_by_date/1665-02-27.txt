Up, and to St. James’s, where we attend the Duke as usual. At
home to dinner; and then in Sir
J.Mennes’s coach, my wife and I
with him, and also Mercer, abroad; he and I to Whitehall, and he
would have his coach to wait upon my wife on her visits — it being
the first time my wife hath been out of doors (but the other day to
bath her) several weeks. We to a committee of the Council to
discourse concerning pressing of men; but Lord, how they meet;
never sit down —one comes, now another goes, then comes another

— one complaining that nothing is done, another swearing that he
hath been there these two hours and nobody came. At last it came to
this: my Lord Annesly, says he, “‘I think we must be forced to get
the King to come to every committee, for I do not see that we do
anything at any time but when he is here.”’ And Ibelieve he said the
truth. And very constant he is at the council table on council days;
which his predecessors, it seems, very rarely did. But thus, I
perceive, the greatest affair in the world at this day is likely to be
managed by us. But to hear how my Lord Berkely and others of
them do cry up the discipline of the late times here, and in the
former Dutch warr, is strange — wishing with all their hearts that
the business of religion were not so severely carried on as to
discourage the sober people to come among us, and wishing that
the same law and severity were used against drunkenness as there
was then — saying that our evil-living will call the hand of God upon
us again. Thence to walk alone a good while in St. James park with
Mr. Coventry, whoI perceive is grown alittle melancholy, and
displeased to see things go as they do — so carelessly.
