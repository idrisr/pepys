Up very betimes; and angry with Will that he made no more
haste to rise after I called him. So to my office and all the morning
there. At noon to the Exchange and so home to dinner, whereI find
my wife hath been with Ashwell at La Roches to have her tooth
drawn, which it seems akes much. But my wife could not get her to
be contented to have it drawn after the first twich, but would let it
alone; and so they came home with it undone, which made my wife
and me good sport. After dinner to the office, where Sir
J.Mennes
did make a great complaint to me alone, how my clerk Mr. Hater
had entered in one of the Seabookes a ticket to have been signed by
him before it had been examined; which makes the old foole mad
almost, though there was upon enquiry the greatest reason in the
world for it — which though it vexes me, yet it is most [plain] to see
from day to day what a coxcomb he is, and that so great a trust
should lie in the hands of sucha foole. We sat all the afternoon; and I
late at my office, it being post night; and so home to supper. And
after supper to bed; and after some talk, to sleep.
