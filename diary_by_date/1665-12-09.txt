Called up betimes by my Lord Brouncker, who is come to
town from his long Water worke at Erith last night— to go with him
to the Duke of Albemarle, which by his coach I did — our discourse
upon the ill posture of the times through lack of money. At the
Dukes did some business, andI believe he was not pleased to see all
the Duke’s discourse and applications to me and everybodys else.
Discoursed also with Sir G. Carteret about office business, but no
money in view. Here my Lord and I stayed and dined, the Vice-
Chamberlain taking his leave. At table, the Duchesse, a damned ill-
looked woman, complaining of her Lord’s going to sea the next
year, said these cursed words — “If my Lord had been a coward he
had gone to sea no more it may be; then he might have been excused
and made an Embassador’”’ (meaning my Lord Sandwich); this
made me mad, andI believe she perceived my countenance change,
and blushed herself very much. I was in hopes others had not
minded it; but my Lord Bruncker, after we were come away, took
notice of the words to me with displeasure. Thence after dinner
away by water, calling and taking leave of Sir G. Carteret, whom
we found going through at Whitehall; and so over to Lambeth and
took coach and home; and so to the office, where late writing
letters; and then home to Mr. Hill and sang, among other things,
my song of Beauty [retire], which he likes; only, excepts against two
notes in the bass, but likes the whole very well. So, late to bed.
