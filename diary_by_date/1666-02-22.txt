Up, and to the office, where sat all morning; at noon home to
dinner, and\thence by coach with my wife for ayre, principally for
her. I alone stopped at Hales’s, and there mightily am pleased with
my wife’s picture that is begun there—and with Mr. Hill’s, though!
must [own] Iam not more pleased with it, now the face is finished,
then I was when I saw the second time of sitting. Thence to my
Lord Sandwiches, but he not within, but goes tomorrow. My wife
to Mrs. Hunts, who is lately come to town, and grown mighty fat. I
called her there, and so home —and late at the office, and so home to
supper and bed. We are much troubled that the sickness in general
(the town being so full of people) should be [up] by 3, and yet of the
perticular disease of the plague, there should be Io encrease.
