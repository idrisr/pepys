Having sat up all night, to past 2 a-clock this morning, our
porter, being appointed, comes and tells us that the Bellman tells
him that the star is seen upon Tower hill. So I, that had been all
night setting in order all my old papers in my chamber, did leave off
all; and my boy and I to Tower hill, it being a most fine bright
moonshine night anda great frost, but no Comett to be seen; so
after running once round the Hill, land Tom, we home and then to
bed. Rose about 9 a-clock; and then to the office, where sitting all
the morning. At noon to the Change to the Coffee-house, and there
heard Sir Rd. Ford tell the whole story of our defeat at Guinny —
wherein our men are guilty of the most horrid cowardize and
perfidiousness, as he says and tells it, that ever Englishmen were.
Capt. Raynolds, that was the only commander of any of the King’s
ships there, was shot at by De Ruyter, with a bloody flag flying. He,
instead of opposing (which endeed had been to no purpose, but
only to maintain honour), did poorly go on board himself to ask
what DeRuter would have; and so yielded to whatever Ruyter
would desire. The King and Duke are highly vexed at it, it seems,
and the business deserves it. Thence home to dinner and then
abroad to buy some things; and among others, to my bookseller’s
and there saw several books Ispoke for, which are finely bound and
good books, to my great content. So home and to my office, where
late. This evening, I being informed, did look and saw the Comett,
which is now, whether worn away or no I know not, but appears
not witha tail; but only is larger and duller then any other star, and
is come to rise betimes and to make a
great arch, and is gone quite to
a new place in the heavens then it was before — but I hope, in a
clearer night something more will be seen. So home to bed.
