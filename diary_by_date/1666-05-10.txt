Soup and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, and there busy all the afternoon till past 6 a-clock; and
then abroad with my wife by coach — who is now at great ease, her
cheek being broke inward. We took with us Mrs. Turner, who was
come to visit my wife, just as we were going out. A great deal of
tittle-tattle discourse to little purpose; Ifinding her (though in other
things a very discreet woman) as very a gossip, speaking of her
neighbours, as anybody. Going out toward Hackny by coach for
the ayre, the silly coachman carries us to Shorditch, which was so
pleasant a piece of simplicity in him and us, that made us mighty
merry. So back again late, it being wonderous hot all the day [and]
night, and it lightening exceedingly all the way we went and came,
but without Thunder. Coming home, we called ata little alehouse
and had an eele pie, of which my wife eat part, and brought home
the rest. So being come home, we to supper and so to bed. This day
came our new cookmaid Mary, commended by Mrs. Batters.
