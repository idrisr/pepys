To Whitehall; and thence, the Council being up, walked to St.
James’s and there had much discourse with Sir W. Coventry at his
chamber — who I find quite weary of the war. Decries our having
any war at all, or himself to have been any occasion of it. That he
hopes this will make us shy of any war hereafter, or to prepare
better for it. Believes that one overthrow on the Duch side would
make them desire peace, and that one on ours will make us willing
to accept of one. Tells me that Comissioner Pett is fallen infinitely
under the displeasure of the Prince and Duke of Albemarle, not
giving them satisfaction in the getting out of the fleet; and that that
complaint, he believes, is come to the King. Thence home, and to
the office — where I met with a letter from Dover which tells me
636
(and it did come by express) that news is brought over by a
gentleman from Callice that the Duch fleet, 130 sail, are come upon
the French coast — and that the country is bringing in Pickeaxes and
Shovells and wheelbarrows into Callice. That there are 6000 men,
armed with head, back, and breast (Frenchmen), ready to go on
board the Duch fleet, and will be fallowed by 12000 more. That
they pretend they are to come to Dover. And that thereupon the
Governor of Dover Castle-is getting the victuallers’ provision out
of the town into the castle, to secure it — but I do think this is a
ridiculous conceit. But a little time will show. At night, home to
supper and to bed.
