earely, Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Wms, and I on board the
Experiment to dispatch her away, she being to carry things to the
Maderas with the East India fleet. Here (Sir W. Penn going to
Deptford to send more hands), we stayed till noon, talking and
eating and drinking a good ham of English bacon; and having put
things in good order, home - whereIfind Jane, my old maid, come
out of the country; and I have a mind to have her again. By and by
comes la Belle Perce to see my wife and to bring her a pair of
peruques of hair, as the fashion now is for ladies to wear — which are
pretty and are of my wife’s own hair, or else I should not endure
them. After a good while stay, I went to see if any play was acted,
and I find none upon the post, it being passion weeke. To
Westminster hall and there bought Mr. Grant’s book of obser-
vations upon the weekely bills of Mortality — which appear to me,
upon first sight, to be very pretty. So back again and took my wife,
calling at my brother Tom’s, whom Ifind full of work, which Iam
glad of; and thence at the New Exchange and so home. AndI to Sir
W. Battens and supped there, out of pure hunger to save getting
anything ready at home, which is a thing I do not nor shall not use
to do. So home and to bed.
