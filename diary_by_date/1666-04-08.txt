Up, and was in great trouble how to get a passage to Whitehall,
it raining — and no coach to be had. SoI walked to the Old Swan and
there got a scull. To the Duke of Yorke, where we all met to hear
the debate between Sir Tho. Allen and Mr. Wayth — the former
1. It was however untrue.
2. Mrs. Knepp.

complaining of the latter’s ill-usage of him at the late pay of his ship
— but a very sorry poor occasion he had for it. The Duke did
determine it with great judgment, chiding both, but encouraging
Wayth to continue to be a check to all Captains in anything to the
King’s right. And endeed I never did see the Duke do anything
more in order, nor with more judgment, then he did pass the
verdict in this business. The Court full this morning of the news of
Tom Cheffins’s death, the King’s closet-keeper. He was well last
night as ever, playing at tables in the House — and not very ill this
morning, 6 a-clock; yet dead before 7— they think of an impostume
in his breast. But it looks fearfully among people nowadays, the
plague, as we hear, increasing everywhere again. To the Chapel,
but could not get in to hear well. But I had the pleasure once in my
life to see an Ar[ch]bishop (this was of Yorke) ina pulpit. Then at a
loss how to get home to dinner, having promised to carry Mrs.
Hunt thither. At last got my Lord Hinchingbrooke’s coach, he
staying at Court; and so took her up in axe yard, and home and
dined — and good discourse of the old matters of the Protector’ and
his family, she having a relation to them. The Protector lives in
France; spends about soo] per annum. Thence carried her home
again; and then to Court, and walked over to St. James’s chapel,
thinking to have heard a Jesuite preach but came too late. So got a
hackney, and home and there to business. At night had Mercer
comb my head; and so to supper, sing a psalm, and to bed.
