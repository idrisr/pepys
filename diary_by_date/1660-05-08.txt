All the morning busy. After dinner my Lord and we at nine-
pins: I lost nine shillings. My letters today tell me how it was
entended that the King should be proclaimed today in London with
a great deal of pomp. I have also news who they are that are chosen
of the Lords and Commons to attend the King. And also the whole
story of what we did the other day in the fleet at reading the King’s
declaration; and my name at the bottom of it. After supper, some
music and to bed —I resolving to rise betimes tomorrow to write
letters to London.
