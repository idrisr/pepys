Atmy office all the morning, reading Mr. Holland’s discourse
of the Navy, lent me by Mr. Turner; and am much pleased with
them, they hitting the very diseases of the Navy which we are
troubled with nowadays. I shall bestow writing of them over and
much reading thereof. This morning Sir W. Batten came in to the
office and desired to speak with me. He begun with telling me that
he observed a strangeness between him and me of late, and would
know the reason of it — telling me that he heard I was offended with
merchants coming to his house and making contracts there. I did
tell him that as a friend I have spoke of it to Sir W. Pen and desired
him to take a time to tell him of it, and not as a backbiter; with
which he was satisfied. at last, he desired the difference between our
wifes might not make a difference between us; which I was
exceeding glad to hear, and do see every day the fruits of looking
after my business, which I pray God continue me in - for I do begin
to be very happy.
