This morning my Lord (all things being ready) carried me by
coach to Mr. Crews, in the way talking how good he did hope my
place would be to me and, in general, speaking that it was not the
salary of any place that did make a man rich, but the opportunities
of getting money while he is in the place: where he took leave and
went into the coach, and so for Hinchingbrooke: my Lady Jem and
Mr. Thomas Crew in the coach with him. Thence to Whitehall
about noon, where I met with Mr. Madge, who took me along
with him and Capt. Cooke (the famous singer) and other Maisters
of Musique to dinner at an ordinary above Charing cross, where we
dined, all paying their club. Thence to the Privy Seal, where there
hath been but little work these two days. In the evening, home.
