To the office; and after dinner by water to Whitehall, where I
find the King gone this morning by 5 of the clock to see a Duch
pleasure-boat” below bridge, where he dines, and my Lord with
him. The King doth tire all his people that are about him with early
rising since he came. To the office. All the afternoon I stayed there.
And in the evening went to Westminster hall, where I stayed at
Mrs. Michells; and with her and her husband sent for some drink
and drunk with them: by the same token, she and Mrs. Murford
and another old woman of the Hall were going a-gossiping*
tonight. From thence to my Lord’s, where I found him within and
he did give me direction about his business in his absence, he
entending to go into the country tomorrow morning.
