This day, by the blessing of Almighty God, I have lived 32
years in the world — and am in the best degree of health at this
minute that I have been almost in my life-time, and at this time in
the best condition of estate that ever I was in; the Lord make me
thankful. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning. At
noon to the Change, where I hear the most horrid and astonishing
news that ever was yet told in my memory — that De Ruiter, with
his fleet in guinny, hath proceeded to the taking of whatever we
have-— forts, goods, ships, and men—and tied our men back to back
and thrown them all into the sea — even women and children also.
This a Swede or Hamburger is come into the River and tells that he
saw the thing done. Home to dinner, and then to the office, where
471
sat all the afternoon; and then at night to take my finall leave of Mrs.
Bland, who sets out tomorrow for Tanger. And then I back to my
office till past 12, and so home to supper and to bed.
