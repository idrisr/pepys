Up, and to my office; and then with Sir W. Batten to St.
James, where many came to take leave, as was expected, of the
Duke; but he doth not go till Monday. The Duke did give us some
commands, and so broke up, not taking leave of him. But the best
piece of newes is that instead of a great many troublesome Lords,
the whole business is to be left with the Duke of Albemarle, to act as
Admirall' in his stead; which is a thing that doth cheer my heart —
for the other would have vexed us with attendance, and never done
the business. Thence to the Committee of Tanger, where the Duke
a little, and then left us and we stayed — a very great Committee —
the Lords Albemarle, Sandwich, Barkely, Fitzharding, Peterbor-
ough, Ashley, Sir Tho. Ingram, Sir G. Carteret, and others. The
whole business was the stating of Povys accounts; of whom, to say
no more, never could man say worse himself nor have worse said of
him then was by that company to his face —I mean as to his folly,
and very reflecting words to his honesty. So broke up. Then he
took occasion to desire me to step aside, and he and I by water to
London together: in the way, of his own accord, proposed to me
that he would surrender his place of Treasurer to me, to have half
the profit. The thing is new to me; but the more I think, the more I
like it, and do put him upon getting it done by the Duke: whether it
takes or no, I care not, but I think at present it may have some
convenience in it.
