Early in the morning, Mr. Hill comes to string my Theorbo,
which we were about till past 10 a-clock, with a great deal of
pleasure. To Westminster by water, only seeing Mr. Pinkny at his
own house, where he showed me how he hath alway kept the Lion
and Unicorne in the back of his chimney bright, in expectation of
the King’s coming again. Great hopesof the King’s coming again.
To bed.
