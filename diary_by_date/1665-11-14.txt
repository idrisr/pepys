1665-11-14

Called up by break of day by Capt. Cocke by agreement, and
he and I in his coach through Kent Streete (a sad place through the
plague, people sitting sick and with plasters about them in the
street, begging) to Viners and Colvills about money business; and
so to my house there and took 3001, in order to the carrying it down
to my Lord Sandwich, in part of the money I am to pay for Capt.
Cocke by our agreement. So I took it down, and down went to
Greenwich to my office, and there sat busy till noon; and so home
to dinner, and thence to the office again, and by and by to the Duke
of Albemarles by water, late— where I find he had remembered that
I had appointed to come to him this day about money, which I
excused not doing sooner. But I see, a dull fellow as he is, doth
sometimes remember what another thinks he minded not. My
business was about getting money of the East India Company. But
Lord, to see how the Duke himself magnifies himself
inwhat he had
done with that Company, and my Lord Craven, what the King
could have done without my Lord Duke; and a deal of stir, but most
$53
mightily, what a brave fellow Iam. Back by water, it raining hard,
and so to the office and stopped my going, as I entended, to the
Buoy of the Noure; and great reason I had to rejoice at it, for it
proved the night of as great a Storme as was almost ever
remembered. Late at the office, and so home to bed. This day,
calling at Mr. Rawlinson’s to know how all did there, [hear that my
pretty grocer’s wife, Mrs. Beversham, over the way there, her
husband is lately dead of the plague at Bow, which I am sorry for,
for fear of losing her neighbourhood.
