Up and to my office, and afterwards sat — where great contest
with Sir W. Batten and Mr. Wood and that doting fool Sir J.
Mennes, that says whatever Sir W. Batten says, though never
minding whether to the King’s profit or not. At noon to the Coffee-
house, where excellent discourse with Sir W. Petty; who proposed
it, as a thing that is truly questionable, whether there really be any
difference between waking and dreaming — that it is hard not only
to tell how we know when we do a thing really or in a dream, but
also to know what the difference between one and the other.
Thence to the Change; but hearing at this discourse and afterward
with Sir Tho. Chamberlin, who tells me what I heard from others,
that the complaints of most Companies were yesterday presented
to the committee of Parliament against the Dutch, excepting that of
the East India, which he tells me was because they would not be said
to be the first and only cause of a war with Holland, and that it is
very probable as well as most necessary that we fall out with that
people — I went to the Change and there found most people gone;
and so home to dinner, and thence to Sir W. Warren’s and with him
passed the whole afternoon; first looking over two ships of Capt.
Taylors and Phin. Pett’s now in building, and am resolved to learn
something of that art, for I find it is not hard, and very useful. And
thence to Woolwich; and after seeing Mr. Falconer, who is very ill,
Ito the yard and there heard Mr. Pett tell me several things of Sir W.
Batten’s ill managements; and so with Sir W. Warren walked to
373
Greenwich, having good discourse; and thence by water, it being
now moonshine and 9 or 10 a-clock at night, and landed at Wapping
and by him and his man safely brought to my door; and so he home
— having spent the day with him very well. So home and eat
something and then to my office a while; and so home to prayers
and to bed.
