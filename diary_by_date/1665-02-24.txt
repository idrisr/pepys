Up, and to my office, where all the morning — upon advising
again with some Fishermen and the Waterbayliffe of the City, by
Mr. Coventry’s direction, touching the protections’ which are
desired for the fishermen upon the River; and I am glad of the
occasion to make me understand something of it. At noon home to
dinner, and all the afternoon, till 9 at night, in my chamber, and Mr.
Hater with me (to prevent being disturbed at the office), to perfect
my contract-book, which for want of time hath a long time lain
without being entered in, as I used to do, from month to month.
