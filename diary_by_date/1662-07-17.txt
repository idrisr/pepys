To my office; and by and by to our sitting — where much
business. Mr. Coventry took his leave, being to go with the Duke
over for the Queene-Mother. I dined at home and so to my Lord’s,
where I presented him with a true state of all his accounts to last
Monday, being the 14 of July — which did please him; and to my
great joy, I continue in his great esteem and opinion. I this day took
a general acquittance from my Lord to the same day —so that now I
have but very few persons to deal withal for money in the world.
Home, and find much business to lie upon my hand; and was late at
the office, writing letters by candlelight, which is rare at this time of
the year. But I do it with much content and joy, and then Ido please
me to see that I begin to have people direct themselfs to me in all
businesses.
