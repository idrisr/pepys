office day. My Brother Tom came to my house witha letter
from my Brother John, wherein he desires some books — Barthol.
Anatomy; Rosinus Roman antiquities, and Gassendus astronomy. The
last of which I did give him, and an angell toward my father’s
buying of the others. At home all the afternoon looking after my
workmen in my house, whose lazinesse doth much trouble me.
