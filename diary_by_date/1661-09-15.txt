Lords day. To my aunt Kites in the morning — to help my uncle
Fenner to put things in order against anon, for the burial. And at
noon home again; and after dinner to church, my wife and I. And
after sermon with my wife to the buriall of my aunt Kite — where
besides us and my uncle Fenners family, there was none of any
Quality, but poor rasckally people. So we went to church with the
Corps and there had service read at the grave; and back again with
Pegg Kite — who will be, I doubt, a troublesome carrion to us
Executors. But if she will not be ruled, I shall fling up my
Executorship. After that home - and Will. Joyce along with me —
where we sat and talked and drunk and eat an hour or two; and so he
went away. And I up to my chamber, and then to prayers and to
bed.
