Up, and to Simpson at work in my office; and thence with Sir
G. Carteret (who came to talk with me) to Broad streete, where
great crowding of people for money, at which he blessed himself.
Thence with him and Lord Brouncker to Capt. Cockes (he out of
doors) and there drunk their morning draught; and thence G.
Carteret and I toward the Temple in coach together, and there he
did tell me how the King doth all he can in the world to overthrow
my Lord Chancellor, and that notice is taken of every man about
the King that is not seen to promote the ruine of the Chancellor; and
that this being another great day in his business, he dares not but be
there. He tells me that as soon as Secretary Morrice brought the
great Seale from my Lord Chancellor, Babb. May fell upon his
knees and ketched the King about the legs and joyed him, and said
that this was the first time that ever he could call him King of
England, being freed this great man — which was a most ridiculous
saying.
