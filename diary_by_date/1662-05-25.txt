Lords day. To trimming myself, which I have this week done
every morning, with a pumice stone, which I learnt of Mr. Marsh
when I was last at Portsmouth; and I find it very easy, speedy and
cleanly, and shall continue the practice of it. To church and heard a
good sermon of Mr. Woodcockes at our church. Dined at home,
and Mr. Creede with me. This day Ihad the first dish of pease Ihave
had this year. After discourse, he and I abroad; and walked up and
down and look into many churches — among other, Mr. Baxters at
Blacketryers. Then to the Wardrobe, where I find my Lord takes
physic, so I did not see him. But with Capt. Ferrers to Charing
cross; and there at the Triumph taverne he showed me some
portugall Ladys which are come to towne before the Queene. They
are not handsome, and their farthingales a strange dress. Many
ladies and persons of Quality come to see them. I find nothing in
them that is pleasing. And I see they have learnt to kiss and look
freely up and downe already, and I do believe will soon forget the
recluse practice of their own country. They complain much for lack
of good water to drink. So to the Wardrobe back on foot, and
supped with my Lady; and so home, and after a walk upon the leads
with my wife, to prayer and bed.
