With Capt. Erwin, discoursing about the East Indys, where
he hath often been. And among other things, he tells me how the
King of Syam seldom goes out without 30 or 40000 people with
him, and not a word spoke nor a hum or cough in the whole
company to be heard. He tells me the punishment frequently there
for malefactors is cutting off the Crowne of their head, which they
do very dexterously, leaving their brains bare, which kills them
presently. He told me, what I remember he hath once done
heretofore — that everybody is to lie flat down at the coming by of
the King, and nobody to look upon him, upon pain of death. And
that he and his fellows, being strangers, were invited to see the sport
of taking of a wild Eliphant. And they did only kneel and look
toward the King. Their Druggerman did desire them to fall down,
for otherwise he should suffer for their contempt of the King. The
sport being ended, a messenger comes from the King, which the
Druggerman thought had been to have taken away his life. But it
was to enquire how the strangers liked the sport. The Druggerman
answered that they did cry it up to be the best that ever they saw,
and that they never heard of any prince so great in everything as this
King. The messenger being gone back, Erwin and his company
asked their Druggerman what he had said, which he told them.
“But why,” say they, “would you say that without our leave, it
being not true?” “It is no matter for that,” says he, “I must have said
it, or have been hanged, for our King doth not live by meat nor
29
drink, but by having great lyes told him.”
