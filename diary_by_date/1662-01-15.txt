This morning Mr. Berchenshaw came again; and after he had
examined me and taught me something in my work, he and I went
173
to breakfast in my chamber, upon a Coller of brawne. And after we
had eaten, he asked me whether we have not committed a fault in
eating today, telling me that it is a fast-day, ordered by the
parliament to pray for more seasonable weather — it having hitherto
been some summer weather, that it is, both as to warmth and every
other thing, just as ifit were the middle of May or June, which doth
threaten a plague (as all men think) to fallow; for so it was almost
the last winter and the whole year after hath beena very sickly time,
to this day. I did not stir out of my house all day, but con’d my
Musique; and at night, after supper to bed.
