Sol went to my Lady’s and elsewhere to take leave. And of
Mr. Townsend did borrow avery fine side-saddle for my wife; and
so afterallthings were ready, she and I took coach to the end of the
towne toward Kingsland; and there got upon my horse and she
upon her pretty mare that I hired her. And she rides very well; by
the mare at one time falling, she got a fall but no harm. So we got to
ware and there supped and to bed, very merry and pleasant.
