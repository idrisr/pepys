Up by 5 a-clock; and after my Journall put in order, to my
office about my business, which I am resolved to fallow, for every
day [I] see what ground I get by it. By and by comes Mr. Cooper,
Mate of the Royall Charles, of whom I entend to learn Mathemat-
iques; and so begin with him today, he being a very able man and no
great matter, I suppose, will content him. After an hour’s being
with him at Arithmetique, my first attempt being to learn the
Multiplicacion table, then we parted till tomorrow: and so to my
business at my office again — till noon; about which time Sir W.
Warren did come to me about business and did begin to instruct me
in the nature of Firre, timber and deals, telling me the nature of
every sort;,and from that, we fall to discourse of Sir W. Batten’s
corruption and the people that he imploys, and from one discourse
to another of that kind; I was much pleased with his company and
so stayed talking with him alone at my office till 4 in the afternoon,
without eating or drinking all day; and then parted and Ihome to eat
a bit, and so back again to my office.
