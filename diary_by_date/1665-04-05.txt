This day was kept publicly, by the King’s command, asa Fast
day against the Duch war. And I betimes with Mr. Tooker, whom I
have brought into the Navy to serve us as a husband to see goods
timely shipped off from hence to the fleet and other places, and took
him with me to Woolwich and Deptford, where by business I have
been hindered a great while of going. Did a very great deal of
business. And then home, and there by promise find Creed, and he
and my wife, Mercer and I, by coach to take the ayre; and where we
have formerly been, at Hackny, did there eat some pullets we
carried with us and some other things of the house; and after a game
or two at shuffleboard, home; and Creed lay with me but being
sleepy, he had no mind to talk about business, which endeed I
intended by inviting him to lie with me. But Iwould not force it on
him, and so to bed, he and I, and to sleep — being the first time Ihave
been so much at my ease and taken so much fresh ayre these many
weeks or months.
