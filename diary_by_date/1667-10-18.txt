To several places to buy a hat and books and neckcloths, and
several errands I did before I got home; and among others, bought
me two new pair of spectacles of Turlington, who it seems is
famous for them. And his daughter, he being out of the way, doth
advise me to very young sights,
' as that that will help me most; and
promises me great ease from them, andI will try them.
