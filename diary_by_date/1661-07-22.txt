Up by 3 and going by 4 on my way to London. But the day
proves very cold; so that having put on noe stockings but thread
ones under my boots, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buya pair of
coarse woollen ones and put them on. So by degrees, till I came to
Hatfield before 12 a-clock — where I had a very good dinner with
my hostesse,at my Lord of Salsburys Inn; and after dinner, though
weary, I walked all alone to the Vineyard, which is now a very
beautiful place again; and coming back, I met with Mr. Looker my
Lord’s gardener (a friend of Mr. Eglins), who showed me the
house, the chappell with rare pictures, and above all the gardens,
such as I never saw in all my life; nor so good flowers nor so great
goosburys, as big as nutmegs. Back to the Inne and drank with him;
and so to horse again, and with much ado got to London and set
him up in Smithfield.
