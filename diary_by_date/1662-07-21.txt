To Woolwich to the Ropeyard; and there looked over the
several sorts of hemp, and did fall upon my great survey of seeing
the working and experiments of the strength and the charge in the
dressing of every sort; and I do think have brought it to so great a
certainty as Ihave done the King great service in it. And do purpose
to get it ready against the Dukes coming to towne, to present to
him. I breakfasted at Mr. Falconer’s well, and much pleased with
214
my inquiries. Thence to the Dock, where we walked in Mr.
Sheldens garden, eating more fruit and drinking and eating figs,
which were very good, and talking, while the Royall James was
bringing towards the docke; and then we went out and saw the
manner and trouble of dockeing such a ship; which yet they could
not do, but only brought her head into the docke and so shored her
up till next tide. But, good God, what a deal of company was there
from both yards to help to do it, when half the company would
have done it as well; but I see it is impossible for the King to have
things done as cheap as other men.
