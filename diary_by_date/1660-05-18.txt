To Delfe to see the town, where when we were come, we got
a smith’s boy to go along with us (but could speak nothing but
Duch), and he showed us the church where Van Trump lies
intombed with a very fine Monument: his epitaph concludes thus
(Tandem Bello Anglico tantum non victor certé invictus vivere et vincere
desijt). There is a sea-fight the best cut in Marble, with the Smoake
the best expressed that ever I saw in my life. From thence to the
great church that stands ina fine great Merket-place over against the
Stathouse; and there I saw a stately tomb of the old Prince of
Orange, of Marble and brass. Wherein, among other rarities, there
is the angels with their trumpets, expressed as it were calling. Here
were very fine organs in both the churches. It is a most sweet town,
with bridges and a river in every street. Observing that in every
46
house of entertainment there hangs in every room a poor-man’s
box and desirous to know the reason thereof, it was told me that it is
their custom to confirm all bargains by putting something into the
poor people’s box, and that that binds as fast as anything. We saw
likewise the Guesthouse, where it was very pleasant to see what
neat preparation there is for the poor. We saw one poor man a-
dying there. Back by water, where a pretty sober Duch lass sat
reading all the way, and I could not fasten any discourse upon her.
