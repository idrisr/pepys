Lords day. Up betimes and got myself ready to go by water; and
about 9 a-clock took boat with Hen. Russell to Gravesend, coming
thither about one, where at the Ship I dined; and thither came to me
Mr. Hosier, whom I went to speak with about several businesses of
work that he is doing, and I would have him do, of writing work
for me. AndI did go with him to his lodging and there did see his
wife, a pretty tolerable -woman, and do find him upon an
extraordinary good work of designing a method of keeping our
storekeepers’ accounts in the Navy. Here I should have met with
Mr. Willson, but he is sick and could not come from Chatham to
me. So having done with Hosier, I took boat again the beginning of
the flood, and came home by 9 at night — with much pleasure, it
being a fine day. Going downI spent readingof the Five Sermons of
Five Several Styles; worth comparing one with another, but I do
think when all is done, that contrary to the design of the book, the
Presbyterian style and the Independent are the best of the five for
sermons to be preached in; this I do by the best of my present
judgment think. And coming back I spent reading the book of
warrants of our office in the first Dutch war, and do find that my
letters and warrants and method will be found another-gate’s
business than this that the world so much adores —and I am glad for
my own sake to find it so. My boy was with me, and read to me all
day, and we sang a while together; and so home to supper a
little,
and so to bed.
