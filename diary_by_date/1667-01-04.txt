Up; and seeing things put in order for a dinner at my house
today, I to the office awhile; and about noon home, and there saw
all things in good order. Anon comes our company — my Lord
Brouncker — Sir W. Penn, his Lady, and Peg and her servant, Mr.
Lowder — my Lady Batten — Sir W. Batten being forced to dine at
Sir R. Ford’s, being invited — Mr. Turner and his wife. Here I had
good room for ten, and no more would my table have held well had
Sir
J.Mennes (who was fallen lame) and his sister and niece and Sir
W. Batten come, which was a great content to me to be without
them. I did.make them all gaze to see themselfs served so nobly in
plate; and a neat dinner endeed, though but of seven dishes. Mighty
merry I was and made them all — and they mightily pleased. My
Lord Brouncker went away after dinner to the Ticket Office, the
rest stayed; only my Lady Batten home, her ague-fit coming on her
at table. The rest merry, and to cards and then to sing and talk; and
at night to sup and then to cards; and last of all, to have a flagon of
Ale and apples, drunk out ofawood Cupp as a Christmas draught,
made all merry; and they full of admiration at my plate, perticularly
my flagons (which endeed are noble); and so late home, all with
great mirth and satisfaction to them as I thought, and to myself to
see all I have and do so much out-do, for neatness and plenty,
anything done by any of them. They gone, I to bed much pleased.
And do observe Mr. Lowder to bea pretty gentleman — and I think
too good for Peg. And by the way, Peg Penn seems mightily to be
kind to me, andI believe by her father’s advice, who is also himself
so — but I believe not a little troubled to see my plenty; and was
much troubled to hear the song I sung — The new Droll —it touching
him home. So to bed.
