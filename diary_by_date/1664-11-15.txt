ThatI might not be too fine for the business Iintend this day, I
did leave off my fine new cloth suit lined with plush and put on my
poor black suit; and after office done (where much business but
442
little done), I to the Change; and thence Bagwell’s wife with much
ado fallowed me through Moorfields to a blind alehouse, and there I
did caress her and eat and drank, and many hard looks and sithes the
poor wretch did give me, and | think verily was troubled at what I
did; but at last, after many protestings, by degrees I did arrive at
what I would, with great pleasure. Then in the evening, it raining,
walked to the town to where she knew where she was; and then I
took coach and to Whitehall to a Committee of Tanger, where, and
everywhere else I thank God, I find myself growing in repute; and
so home and late, very late, at business, nobody minding it but
myself; and so home to bed— weary and full of thoughts. Businesses
grow high between the Dutch and us on every side.
