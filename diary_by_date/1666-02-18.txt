Lords day. Lay long in bed, discoursing with pleasure with my
wife; among other things, about Pall’s coming up, for she must be
here a little to be fashioned. And my wife hath a mind to go down
for her — which I am not much against, and so I rose and to my
chamber to settle several things. Atnoon comes my Uncle Wight to
dinner, and brings with him Mrs. Wight; sad company to me, nor
was I much pleased with it — only, I must show respect to my
Uncle. After dinner, they gone and it being a brave day, Iwalked to
Whitehall, where the Queene and ladies are all come; I saw some
few of them, but not the Queen nor any of the great beauties. I
endeavoured to have seen my Lord Hinchingbrooke, who came to
town yesterday, but I could not. Met with Creed, and walked with
him a turn or two in the park, but without much content, having
now designs of
getting money in my head, which allows me not the
leisure I used to have with him. Besides, an odde story lately told of
him for a great truth, of his endeavouring to lie with a woman at
Oxford, and her crying out saved her; and this being publicly
known, doth a little make me hate him. Thence took coach, and
calling by the way at my bookseller’s for a book, writ about twenty
years ago in prophecyofthis year coming on, 1666, explaining it to
585
be the mark of the beast. I home and there fell to reading, and then
to supper and to bed.
