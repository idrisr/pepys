This morning my brother Tom brought me my Jackanapes
coat with silver buttons. It rained this morning, which makes us
fear the glory of this great day will be lost, the King and Parliament
being to be intertained by the City today with great pomp. Mr.
Hater was with me today, and I agreed with him to be my clerk.
Being at Whitehall, I saw the King, the Dukes and all their
attendants go forth in the rain to the City and bedaggled manya fine
suit of clothes. I was forced to walk all the morning in Whitehall,
not knowing how to get out because of the rain. Met with Mr.
Cooling, my Lord Chamberlins secretary, who took me to dinner
among the gentlemen wayters — and after dinner into the wine-
cellar. He told me how he hath a project for all us Secretaries to join
together and get money by bringing all business into our hands.
Thence to the Admirallty, where Mr. Blackburne, and I (it
beginning to hold up) went and walked an hour or two in the park,
he giving of me light in many things in my way in this office that I
go about. At my Lord’s at night comes Dr. Petty to me to tell me
that Barlow was come to town and other things, which put me into
a despair and I went to bed very sad.
