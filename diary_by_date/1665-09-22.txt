Up betimes, and to the office, meaning to have entered my
last five or six days’ journall, but was called away by my Lord
Bruncker and Sir
J.Mennes; and to Blackewall, there to look after
the storehouses, in order to the layingof goods out of the East India
ships when they shall be unloaden. That being done, we into
Johnsons house and were much made of—eating and drinking. But
here it is observable what he tells us; that digging his late Docke, he
did 12-foot under ground find perfect trees over-Covered with
earth — nut-trees, with the branches and the very nuts upon them —
some of whose nuts he showed us — their shells black with age and
their Kernell, upon opening, decayed; but their shell perfectly hard
as ever. And an Ewetree he showed us (upon which he says the very
Ivy was taken up whole about it), which upon cutting with an
addes, we found to be rather harder then the living tree usually is —
they say very much; but I do not know how hard a yew-tree
naturally is.
