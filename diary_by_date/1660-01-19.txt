This morning I was sent for to Mr. Downing, and at his
bedside he told me that he hath a kindness for me, and that he
thought that he hath done me one; and that was, that he hath got me
to be one of the Clerks of the Council; at which I was alittle
stumbled and could not tell what to do, whether to thank him or no;
but I by and by did, but not very heartily, for I feared that his doing
of it was but only to ease himself of the salary which he give me.
Thence to my office, and so with Mr. Sheply and Moore to dine
7
upon a turkey with Mrs. Jem; and after that, Mr. Moore and I went
to the French ordinary, where Mr. Downing this day feasted Sir
Arth. Haslerig and a great many more of the Parliament; and did
stay to put him in mind of me. Here he gave me a note to go and
invite some other members to dinner tomorrow. So I went to
Whitehall, and did stay at Marshes with Simons, Luellin and all the
rest of the Clerks of the Council, who Ihear are all turned out, only
the two Leighs; and they do all tell me that my name was mentioned
the last night, but that nothing was done in it. Hence I went and did
leave some of my notes at the lodgings of the members, and so
home. To bed.
