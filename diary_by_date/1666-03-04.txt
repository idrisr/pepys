Lords day. And all day at my Tanger and private accounts,
having neglected them since Christmas; which I hope I shall never
do again, for I find the inconvenience of it, it being ten times the
labour to remember and settle things; but I thank GodI did it at last,
and brought them all fine and right; and I am, Ithink, by all appears
to me (andI am sure I cannot be rol wrong), worth above 4600; for
which the Lord be praised, being the biggest sum I ever was worth
yet.
