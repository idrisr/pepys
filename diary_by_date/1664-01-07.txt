Up, putting on my best clothes, and to the office, where all the
morning we sat busy; among other things, upon Mr. Wood’s
performance of his contract for Masts, wherein I was mightily
concerned, but Ithink was found all along in the right and shall have
340
my desire in it, to the King’s advantage. At noon all of us to dinner
to Sir W. Pens, where a very handsome dinner. Sir J. Lawson
among others, and his lady and his daughter, a very pretty lady and
of good deportment — with looking upon whom I was greatly
pleased. The rest of the company of the women were all of our own
house, of no satisfaction or pleasure at all. My wife was not there,
being not well enough nor had any great mind. But to see how Sir
W. Penn imitates me in everything, even in his having of his
chimney piece in his dining-room the same with that in my wife’s
closet—and in everything else, Iperceive, wherein he can. But to see
again how he was out in one compliment: he lets alone drinking any
of the ladies’ healths that were there (my Lady Batten and Lawson)
till he had begun with my Lady Carteret, who was absent (and that
was well enough), and then Mr. Coventry’s mistress, at which he!
was ashamed and would not have had him have drunk it,
at least before the ladies present; but his policy, as he thought, was
such that he would do it. After dinner, by coach with Sir G.
Carteret and Sir
J.Mennes by appointment to Auditor Beale’s in
Salsbury court, and there we did with great content look over some
old Leigers to see in what manner they were kept; and endeed it was
in an extraordinary good method, and such as (at least out of design
to keep them imployed) I do persuade Sir
J.Mennes to go upon,
which will at least do so much good, it may be, to keep them for
want of something to do from envying those that do something.
