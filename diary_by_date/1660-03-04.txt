Lords day. Before I went to church I sang Orpheus Hymne to my
Viall. After that to Mr. Guning’s; an excellent sermon upon
Charity. Then to my mother to dinner, where my wife and the
maid was come. After dinner, we three to Mr. Messum’s, where
we met Monsieur Limpertinent, who got us a seat and told me a
ridiculous story; how that last week he had caused a simple cit-
izen to spend 8ol in entertainments of him and some friends of his,
upon pretence of some service that he would do him in his suit
after a widow. Then to my mother again; and after supper, she and
I talked very high about Religion, I in defence of the Religion I
24
was born in.! Then home.
