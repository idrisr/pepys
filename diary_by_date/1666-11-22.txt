Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. And my
Lord Brouncker did show me Holler’s new print of the City, witha
pretty representation of that part which is burnt, very fine endeed.
And tells me that he was yesterday sworn the King’s servant, and
that the King hath commanded him to go on with his great map of
1. The Pentland Rising; a rebellion of Covenanters in the South-West.

the City which he was upon before the City was burned, like
Gombout of Paris; which I am glad of. At noon home to dinner,
where my wife and I fell out, I being displeased with her cutting
away a lace hankercher so wide about the neck, down to her breasts
almost, out of belief, but without reason, that it is the fashion. Here
we did give one another the lie too much, but were presently
friends; and then I to my office, where very late and did much
business; and then home, and there find Mr. Batelier — and did sup
and play at Cards awhile. But he tells me the news how the King of
France hath, in defiance to the King of England, caused all his
footmen to be put into Vests, and that the noblemen of France will
do the like; which, if true, is the greatest indignity ever done by one
prince to another.’ So Ileft my people at Cards, and to my chamber
to read, and then to bed. Batelier did bring us some oysters tonight,
and some bottles of new French wine of this year, mighty good —
but I drank but little. This noon Bagwell’s wife was with me at the
office, and I did what I would; and at night came Mrs. Burroughs,
and appointed to meet upon the next holiday and go abroad
together.
