office all the morning. My wife and I by water; Ilanded her at
86
Whitefriers, who went to my father’s to dinner, it being my father’s
wedding day, there being a very great dinner and only the Fenners
and Joyces there. I was forced to go to my Lord’s to get him to meet
the officers of the Navy this afternoon, and so could not go along
with her. But I missed my Lord, who was this day upon the bench
at the Sessions house. So I dined there and went to Whitehall, where
I met with Sir W. Batten and Pen, who with the Comptroller,
Treasurer, and Mr. Coventry (at his Chamber) made upalist of
such ships as are fit to be kept out for the Winter guard —and the rest
to be paid off by the Parliament when they can get money, which I
doubt will not be a great while. That done, I took Coach and called
my wife at my father’s, and so home whereI fell to read The
fmitlesse precaution (a book formerly recommended by Dr. Clerke
at sea to me), which I read in bed till I had made an endofit and do
find it the best-writ tale that ever I read in my life. After that done,
to sleep, which I did not very well do because that my wife, having
a stopping in her nose, she snored much, which Inever did hear her
do before.
