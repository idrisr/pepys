Twelfe day. This morning I sent my lute to the painter’s; and
there I stayed with him all the morning, to see him paint the neck of
my lute in my picture — which I was not much pleased with after it
was done. Thence to dinner to Sir Wm. Pens (it being a solemn
feast-day with him, his wedding day; and we have, besides a good
chine of beef and other good cheer, eighteen mince-pies in a dish,
the number of the years that he hath been married); where Sir W.
Batten and his Lady and daughter was, and Coll. Treswell and Maj.
Holmes, who I perceive would fain get to be free and friends with
my wife; but I shall prevent it, and she herself hath also a defyance
against him.
