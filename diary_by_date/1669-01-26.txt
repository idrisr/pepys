Upand to the office, where busy sitting all the morning. Then
to the office again, and then to Whitehall, leaving my wife at
Unthankes; and I to the Secretary’s chamber, where I was by
perticular order this day summoned to attend, as I find Sir D.
Gawden also was, and here was the King and the Cabinet met; and
being called in among the rest, I find my Lord Privy Seale, whom I
never before knew to be in so much play as to be of the Cabinet. The
business is that the Algerins have broke the peace with us, by taking
982
out some Spaniards and goods out of an English ship which had the
Duke of York’s pass — of which advice came this day; and the King
is resolved to stop Sir Tho. Allen’s fleet from coming home till he
hath amends made him for this affront, and therefore sent for us to
advise about victuals to be sent to the fleet, and some more ships —
wherein I answered them to what they demanded of me, which was
but some few mean things; but I see that on all these occasions they
seem to rely most upon me. And so this being done, I took coach
and took up my wife, and straight home and there late at the office
busy; and then home, and there I find W. Batelier hath also sent the
books which I bade him bring me out of France; among others,
L’estat de France, Marnix, &c., to my great content; and so Iwas well
pleased with them and shall take a time to look them over, as also
one or two printed music-books of songs; but my eyes are now too
much out of tune to look upon them with any pleasure. Therefore,
to supper and to bed. F
