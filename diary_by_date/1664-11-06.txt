Lords day. Up, and with my wife to church. Dined at home.
And I all the afternoon close at my office, drawing up some
proposals to present to the committee for the Fishery tomorrow —
having a great good intention to be serviceable in that business if I
can. At night to supper with my uncle Wight, where very merry;
and so home — to prayers and to bed.
