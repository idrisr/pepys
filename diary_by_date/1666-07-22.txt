Lords day. Up, and to my chamber and there till noon, mighty
busy setting money matters and other things of mighty moment to
rights, to the great content of my mind, Ifinding that accounts but a
little let go can never be put in order by strangers, for I cannot
without much difficulty do it myself. After dinner to them again till
about 4 a-clock, and then walked to Whitehall, where saw nobody
almost, but walked up and down with Hugh May, who is a very
1. Rupert and Albemarle.

ingenious man — among other things, discoursing of the present
fashion of gardens, to make them plain — that we have the best
walks of Gravell in the world — France having none, nor Italy; and
our green of our bowling-alleys is better then any they have. So our
business here being ayre, this is the best way, only witha little
mixture of Statues or pots, which may be handsome, and so filled
with another pot of such or such, a flower or greene, as the season of
the year will bear. And then for Flowers, they are best seen in little
plat by themselfs; besides, their borders spoil the walks of any other
garden. And then for fruit, the best way is to have Walls built
Circularly, one within another, to the South, on purpose for fruit,
and leaving the walking-garden only for that use. Thence walked
through the house, where most people mighty hush, and methinks
melancholy, I saw not a smiling face through the whole Court.
