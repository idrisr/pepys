Lords day. This morning was brought me my boyes fine
livery, which is very handsome, and I do think to keep to black and
gold lace upon gray, being the colour of my armes, for ever. To
church in the morning. And so home with Sir W. Batten and there
eat some boiled great oysters; and so home, and while I was at
dinner with my wife, I was sick and was forced to vomitt up my
oysters again and then I was well. To Whitehall and there met with
Capt. Isham, this day come from Lisbone with letters from the
Queene to the King. And did give me letters which speak that our
fleet is all at Lisbon; and that the Queene doth not entend to
embarque sooner then tomorrow come fortnight.
