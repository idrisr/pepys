Sunday. To Dr. Hardys church and sat with Mr. Rawlinson
and heard a good sermon upon the occasion of the Dukes death. His
78
text was — “And is there any evil in the city and the Lord hath not
done it?”” Home to dinner — having some sport with Wm: who
never hath been at Common prayer before. After dinner, I alone to
Westminster, where I spent my time walking up and down in
Westminster Abbey all sermon time. From thence to the parke,
where I saw how far they have proceeded in the pellmell and in
making ofa river through the parke, which Ihave never seen before
since it was begun. Thence to Whitehall garden, where I saw the
King in purple mourning for his brother. So home; and in my way
met with Dinah, who spoke to me and told me she hath a desire to
speak to [me] about some business when I come to Westminster
again — which she spoke in such a manner that I was afeared she
might tell me something that Iwould not hear of our last meeting at
my house at Westminster. Home, it being very dark. There was a
gentleman in the poultry had a great and dirty fall over a water-pipe
that lay along the Channell.
