Up, without being friends with my wife, nor great enemies,
being both quiet and silent. So out to Colvills; but he not being
come to town yet, I to Paul’s churchyard to treat with a bookbinder
to come and gild the backs of all my books to make them
handsome, to stand up in my new presses when they come.
