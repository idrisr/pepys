Up, and to the office, where all the morning doing little
business, our want of money being so infinite great. At noon home,
and there find old Mr. Michell and Howlett come to desire mine
and my wife’s company to dinner to their son’s; and so away by
coach with them, it being Betty’s wedding-day a year — as also
Shrove tuseday. Here I made myself mighty merry, the two old
women being there also; and a mighty pretty dinner we had in this
little house, to my exceeding great content and my wife’s, and my
heart pleased to see Betty. But I have not been so merry a very great
while as with them, everything pleasing me there as much as
among so mean company I could be pleased. After dinnerI fell to
read the Acts about the building of the City again; and endeed, the
laws seem to be very good, and I pray God I may live to see it built
in that manner. Anon, with much content home, walking with my
wife and her woman; and there to my office, where late doing much
business; and then home to supper and to bed. This morning I hear
that our discourseofpeace is all in the dirt, for the Dutch do not like
of the place;' or at least, the French will not agree to it; so that I do
wonder what we shall do, for carry on the war we cannot. Ilong to
hear the truth of it tomorrow at Court.
