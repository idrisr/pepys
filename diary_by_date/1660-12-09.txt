Lords day. Being called up earely by Sir W. Batten, I rose and
went to his house and he told me the ill news that he hath this
morning from Woolwich: that the Assurance (formerly Capt.
Hollands ship, and now Capt. Stoakes, designed for Guiny and
manned and victualled), was by a gust of wind sunk down to the
bottom. Twenty men drowned. Sir Wms both went by barge
thither to see how things are—and Iam sent to the Duke of Yorke to
tell him. And by boat, with some other company going to
Whitehall from the old Swan, I went to the Duke. And first calling
upon Mr. Coventry at his Chamber, I went to the Duke’s bedside
(who hath sat up late last night and lay long this morning), who was
much surprized therewith. This being done, Iwent to Chappell and
sat in Mr. Blagraves pew and there did sing my part along with
another before the King — and with much ease. From thence going
to my Lady, I met with a letter from my Lord (which Andrew hath
been at my house to bring me, but missed me) commanding me to
go to Mr. Denham to get a man to go to him tomorrow to
IOI
Hinchingbrooke to Contrive with him about some alteracions in
his house; which I did, and got Mr. Kennard. Dined with my Lady
and stayed all afternoon with her; and had infinite of talk of all kinds
of things, especially of beauty of men and women, with which she
seems to be much pleased to talk of.
