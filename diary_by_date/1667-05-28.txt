After dinner, my wife away down with Jane and W. Hewer to
Woolwich in order toa
little ayre, and to lie there tonight and so to
gather May dew tomorrow morning, which Mrs. Turner hath
taught her as the only thing in the world to wash her face with, and I
am contented with it. Presently comes Creed, and he and Iby water
to Foxhall and there walked in Spring garden; a great deal of
company, and the weather and garden pleasant; that it is very
pleasant and cheap going thither, for a man may go to spend what
he will, or nothing, all as one— but to hear the nightingale and other
birds, and here fiddles and there a harp, and here a jews trump, and
here laughing, and there fine people walking, is mighty divertising.
Among others, there were two pretty women alone, that walked a
great while; which [being] discovered by some idle gentlemen, they
would needs take them up; but to see the poor ladies, how they
were put to it to run from them, and they after them; and
sometimes the ladies put themselfs along with other company, then
the others drew back; at last, the ladies did get off out of the house
and took boat and away. I was troubled to see them abused so; and
could have found my heart, as little desire of fighting as I have, to
have protected the ladies. So by water; set Creed down at
Whitehall, and I to Old Swan and so home. My father gone to bed
and wife abroad at Woolwich, I to Sir W. Penn, where he and his
Lady and Pegg, and pretty Mrs. Lowther, her sister-in-law, at
supper; where I sat and talked, and Sir W. Penn, half drunk, did talk
like a fool and vex his wife, that I was half pleased and half vexed to
see so much folly and rudeness from him; and so late home to bed.
