Rules for my health. 1. To begin to keep myself warm as I can.
2. Strain as little as ever Ican backwards, remembering that my pain
will come by and by, though in the very straining I do not feel it.
3. Either by physic forward or by clyster backward, or both ways,
to get an easy and plentiful going to stool and breaking of wind.
4. To begin to suspect my health immediately when I begin to be-
come costive and bound, and by all means to keep my body loose,
and that to obtain presently after Ifind myself going to the contrary.

that he knows much of the temper of the City and is able to acquaint
therein as much as most young men — being of large acquaintance,
and himself I think somewhat unsatisfied with the present state of
things at Court and in the Church.
