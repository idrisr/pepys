Lords day. Got up betimes and walked [towards] St. James’s.
The Queene coming by in her coach, going to her chapel at St.
James’s (the first time it hath been ready for her), I crowded after
her; and got up to the room where her closet is and there stood and
saw — the fine Alter, ornaments, and the fryers in their habits and
the priests come in with their fine Copes. And many other very fine
things. I heard their Musique too; which may be good, but it did
not appear so to me, neither as to their manner of singing nor was it
good Concord to my eares, whatever the matter was. The Queene
very devoute. But what pleased me best was to see my dear Lady
Castlemayne; who though a protestant, did wait upon the Queene
to chapel. By and by, after masse was done, a Fryer with his Coole
did rise up and preach a sermon in Portuges; which I not
understanding, did go away.
