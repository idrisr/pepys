Dined at home; and there being the famous new play acted the
first time today, which is call[ed] The Adventures offive houres, at the
Duke’s house, being they say made or translated by Coll. Tuke, I
did long to see it and so made my wife to get her ready, though we
were forced to send for a smith to break open her Trunke, her maid
Jane being gone forth with the keyes. And so we went; and though
earely, were forced to sit almost out of sight at the end of one of the
lower formes, so full was the house. And the play, in one word, is
the best, for the variety and the most excellent continuance of the
plot to the very end, that ever I saw or think ever shall. And all
possible, not only to be done in that time, but in most other respects
very admittible and without one word of ribaldry. And the house,
by its frequent plaudites, did show their sufficient approbacion. So
home, with much ado in an hour getting a coach home; and after
writing letters at my office, Iwent home to supper and to bed—now -
resolving to set up my rest as to plays till Easter, ifnot Whitsuntide
next, excepting plays at Court.
