Up betimes and to my office; a good while at my new rulers,
then to business. And towards noon to the exchange with Creede,
where we met with Sir J. Minnes coming in his coach from
Westminster; who tells us in great heat that, by God, the parliament
will make mad work; that they will render all men incapable of any
military or Civill imployment that have borne arms in the late
troubles against the King, excepting some persons — which if it be
so, as Ihope it is not, will give great cause of discontent, and Idoubt
will have but bad effects. Ileft them at the Exchange and Iwalked to
Pauls churchyard to look upon a book or two, and so back and
thence to the Trinity house and there dined — where, among other
discourse worth hearing among the old Seamen, they tell us that
they have ketched often in Greenland in fishing Whales, with the
Iron grapnells that had formerly been struck into their bodies
covered over with fat — that they have had eleven hogsheadds of
Oyle out of the Tongue of a Whale.
