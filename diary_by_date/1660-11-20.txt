About 2 a-clock my wife wakes me and comes to bed; and so
both to sleep and the wench to wash. I rise and with Will to my
Lord’s by land, it being a very hard frost and the first we have had
this year. There I stayed with my Lord and Mr. Sheply, looking
over my Lord’s accounts and to set matters straight between him
and Sheply. And he did commit the viewing of those accounts to
me — which was a great joy to me to see that my Lord doth look
upon me as one to put trust in. Then to the Organ, where Mr.
Childe and one Mr. Mackworth (who plays finely upon the viallin)
were playing, and so we played till dinner. After dinner Mr. Sheply
and I to the new Playhouse near Lincolnes Inn fields (which was
formerly Gibbons’s tennis-court), where the play of Beggars’ bush
was newly begun. And so we went in and saw it. It was well acted
(and here I saw the first time one Moone, who is said to be the best
actor in the world, lately come over with the King); and endeed it 1s
the finest playhouse, I believe, that ever was in England. From
thence, after a pot of ale with Mr. Sheply at a house hard by, I went
by link home, callinga little by the way at my father’s and my uncle
Fenner’s, where all pretty well. And so home, where I found the
house in a washing pickle; and my wife in a very joyful condition
when I told her that she is to see the Queene next Thursday. Which
puts me in mind to say that this morning I found my Lord in bed
late, he having been with the King, Queene, and Princesse at the
Cockpitt all night, where Gen. Monke treated them; and after
supper, a play — where the King did put a great affront upon
Singleton’s Musique, he bidding them stop and bade the French
Musique play — which my Lord says doth much out-do all ours.
