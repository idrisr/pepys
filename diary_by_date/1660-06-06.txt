Inthe morning I had letters come that told me, among other
things, that my Lord’s place of Clerke of the Signett' was fallen to
him. Which he most lovingly did tell me that I should execute, in
case he could not get a better imployment for me at the end of the
year — because he thought that the Duke of Yorke would command
all, but he hoped that the Duke would not remove me but to my
advantage. I had a great deal of talk about my uncle Robt:, and he
told me that he could not tell how his mind stood as to his estate.
But he would do all that lay in his power for me. After dinner came
Mr. Cooke from London, who told me that my wife he left well at
Huntsmore, though her health not altogether so constant as it used
to be, which my heart is troubled for. My letters tell me that my
Lord hath some great place conferred on him, and they say Master
of the Wardrobe. I wrote to my father for a coat to be made me
against I come to London, which I think will not be long.
