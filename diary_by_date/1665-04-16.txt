Lords day. Lay long in bed. Then up and to my chamber and
my office, looking over some plats, which Ifind necessary for me to
understand pretty well, because of the Duch warr. Then home to
dinner, where Creed dined with us. And so after dinner he and I
walked to the Rolls chapel, expecting to hear the great Stillingfleete
preach; but he did not, but a very sorry fellow, which vexed me.
The sermon done, we parted, and I home — where I find Mr.
Andrews; and by and by comes Capt. Taylor, my old acquaintance
at Westminster that understands Musique very well and composes
mighty bravely; he brought us some things of two parts to sing,
very hard. But that that is the worst, he is very conceited of them;
and that, though they are good, makes them troublesome to one, to
see him every note commend and admire them. He supped with
me, and a good understanding man he is and a good Scholler — and
among other things, a great Antiquary. And among other things,
he can, as he says, show the very Originall Charter to Worcester of
King Edgars, wherein he styles himself Rex Marium Brittanie &c.;
which is the great text that Mr. Selden and others do quote, but
482
imperfectly and upon trust. But he hath the very originall, which he
says he will show me. He gone, we to bed. This night I am told the
news is come of our taking of three Duch men-of-war, with the loss
of one of our Captains.
