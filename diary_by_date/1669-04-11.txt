Lords day. Easter day. Up, and to church, where Ald.
Backewell’s wife and mother and boy and another gentlewoman
did come and sit in our pew — but no women of our own there, and
so there was room enough. Our parson made a dull sermon; and so
home to dinner, and after dinner my wife and I out by coach, and
Balty with us, to Loton the landskip-drawer, a Dutchman living in
St. James’s market, but there saw no good pictures; but by accident
he did direct us to a painter that was then in the house with him, a
Dutchman newly come over, one Everelst, who took us to his
lodging close by and did show usalittle flower pott of his doing, the
finest thing that ever I saw in my life—the drops of Dew hanging on
the leaves, so as Iwas forced again and again to put my finger to it to
feel whether my eyes were deceived or no. He doth ask 7o! for it; I
had the vanity to bid him 201 — but a better picture Inever saw in my
whole life, and it is worth going twenty miles to see. Thence,
leaving Balty there, I took my wife to St. James’s and there carried
her to the Queen’s Chapel, the first time I ever did it — and heard
excellent music. Thence to the park, my wife and J; and here Sir W.
Coventry did first see me and my wife in.a.coach of our own, and so
did also this night the Duke of York, who did eye my wife
1006
mightily. But I begin to doubt that my being so much seen in my
own coach at this time may be observed to my prejudice — but I
must venture it now. So home; and by night home and so to my
office and there set down my journal, with the help of my left eye
through my tube, for fourteen days past; which is so much, as I
hope shall not run in arrear again, but the badness of my eyes doth
force me to it. So home to supper and to bed.
