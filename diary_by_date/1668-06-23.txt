Up, andall the morning at the office. Atnoon home to dinner;
930
and so to the office again all the afternoon, and then to Westminster
to Dr. Turberville about my eyes; whom I met with, and he did
discourse I thought learnedly about them, and takes time, before he
did prescribe me anything, to think of it. So I away with my wife
and Deb, whomIleft at Unthankes; and so to Hercules Pillars, and
there we three supped on cold powdered beef; and thence home and
in the garden walked a good while with Deane, talking well of the
Navy miscarriages and faults. So home to bed.
