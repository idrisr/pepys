Up early, the first day that I put on my black Camlott coat
with silver buttons. To Mr. Spong, whom I found in his night-
1. The warrant for the issue of the patent appointing him Clerk of the Acts.

gown writing of my patent; and he had done as far as he could by
8 a-clock. It being done, we carried it to Worcester house to the
Chancellors, where Mr. Kipps got me the Chancellors Recepi to my
Bill. And so carried it to Mr. Beale for a Dockett; but he was very
angry, and unwilling to do it, because he said it was ill-writ
(because I had got it writ by another hand and not by him); but by
much importunity I got Mr. Spong to go to his office and make an
end of my patent, and in the meantime Mr. Beale to be preparing
my Dockett; which being done, I did give him two pieces, after
which it was strange how civil and tractable he was to me. From
thence I went to the Navy Office, where we despatched much
business and resolved of the houses for the Officers and Comiss-
ioners, which I was glad of, and I got leave to have a door made me
into the leads. To my Lord’s, late writing letters. And great doings
of Musique at the next house, which was Whallys; the King and
Dukes there with Madam Palmer’, a pretty woman that they have a
fancy to to make her husband a cuckold. Here, at the old door that
did go into those lodgings, my Lord and I and W. Howe did stand
listening a great while to the Musique. After that, home to bed with
the greatest quiet of mind that I have had a great while, having eat
nothing but a bit of bread and cheese today, and a bit of bread and
butter after I was a-bed.
