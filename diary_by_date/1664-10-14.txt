Up by break of day and got to Brampton by
3[sic.] a-clock —
where my father and mother overjoyed to see me — my mother
ready to weep every time she looked upon me. After dinner my
father and I to the Court and there did all our business to my mind,
as I have set down in a paper perticularly expressing our proceed-
ings at this Court. So home, where W. Joyce full of talk and pleased
with his journey. And after supper, I to bed and left my father,
mother and him laughing.
