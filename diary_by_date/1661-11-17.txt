Lords day. To our own church. And at noon by invitation Sir
W. Penn dined with me and I took Mrs. Hester (my Lady Batten’s
kinswoman) to dinner from church with me — and we were very
merry. So to church again and heard a simple fellow upon the praise
of church musique, and exclaiming against men’s wearing their
hats on in the church. But I slept part of the sermon, till later prayer
and blessing; and ail was done without waking, which I never did in
my life. So home; and by and by comes my Uncle Wight and my
aunt and Mr. Norbury and his lady. And we drank hard and were
very merry till supper time; and then we parted, my wife and I
being invited to Sir Pen’s where we also were very merry; and so
home to prayers and to bed.
