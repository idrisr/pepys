My Lord called me into his cabin and told me how he was
commanded to set sail presently for the King, and was very glad
thereof; and so put me to writing of letters and other work that
night till it was very late, he going to bed. I got him afterwards to
42
sign things in bed. After I had done some more work, I to bed also.
