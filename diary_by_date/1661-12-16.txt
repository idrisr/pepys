1661-12-16

Upby 5 a-clock this morning by candlelight (which Ihave not
been of many a day), being called up by one Mr. Bollen by
appointment, who hath business to be done with my Lord Privy
Seale this morning. And so by Coach, calling Mr. Moore at the
Wardrobe, to Chelsy, and there did get my Lord to seal it. And so
back again to Westminster hall, and thence to my Lord Sandwiches
lodgings, where I met my wife (who had been to see Mrs. Hunt,
who was brought to bed the other day ofaboy); and got a Joynt of
meat thither from the Cookes and she and I and Sarah dined
together; and after dinner to the Opera, where there was a new play
(Cutter of Colemanstreete) made in the year 1658, with reflection
much upon the late times. And it being the first time, the pay was
doubled; and so to save money, my wife and I went up into the
gallery and there sat and saw very well; anda very good play it is—it
seems of Cowly’s making. From thence by coach home. And to
bed.
