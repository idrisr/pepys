Saturday. This morning, from some difference between my
wife and Sarah her maid, my wife andI fell out cruelly, to my great
discontent. But I do see her set so against the wench, which Itake to
be a most extraordinary good servant, that I was forced for the
wench’s sake to bid her get her another place — which shall cost
some trouble to my wife, however, before I suffer to be. This day I
bought the book of country-dances against my wife’s woman
Gosnell comes, who dances finely. And meeting Mr. Playford, he
did give me his Latin Songs of Mr. Deerings, which he lately
printed. This day Mr. Moore told me that for certain the Queene
Mother is married to my Lord St. Albans, and he is like to be made
235
Lord Treasurer.’ News that Sir J. Lawson hath made up a peace
now with Tunis and Tripoli as well as Argiers; by which he will
come home very highly honoured.
