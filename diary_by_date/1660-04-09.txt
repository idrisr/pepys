Wehaving sailed all night, were come in sight of the North and
South forelands in the morning, and so sailed all day. In the
afternoon we had a very fresh gale, which I brooked better than I
thought I should be able to do. About 5 a-clock we came to the
Goodwin; so to the castles about Deale, where our fleet lay, among
whom we anchored. Great was the shot of guns from the castles and
ships and our answers, that I never heard yet so great rattling of
guns. Nor could we see one another on board for the smoke that
was among us, nor one ship from another.
