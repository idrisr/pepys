Up betimes, and by water to Westminster, there to speak the
first time with Sir Robt. Long, to give him my privy seal and my
Lord Treasurers order for Tanger Tallys. He received me kindly
enough. Thence home by water; and presently down to Woolwige
and back to Blackewall, and there viewed the Breach, in order to a
1. Sayes Court, Deptford.

mast-Docke; and so to Deptford to the Globe, where my Lord
Brunkard, Sir J. Mennes, Sir W. Batten, and Comissioner Pett
were at dinner, having been at the Breach also — but they find it will
be of too great charge to make use of it. After dinner to Mr.
Evelings; he being abroad, we walked in his garden, and a lovely
noble ground he hath endeed. And among other rarities, a hive of
Bees; so, as being hived in glass, you may see the Bees making their
honey and Combs mighty pleasantly. Thence home, and I by and
by to Mr. Povy’s to see him, who is yet in his chamber, not well.
And thence by his advice to one Lovetts, a Varnisher, to see his
manner of new varnish, but found not him at home; but his wife a
very beautiful woman, who showed me much variety of admirable
work; and is in order to my having of some papers fitted with lines,
for my use for Tables and the like. I know not whether I was more
pleased with the thing, or that Iwas showed it by her. But resolved I
am to have some made. So home to my office late, and then to
supper and to bed. My wife tells me that she hears that my poor
aunt James hath had her breast cut off here in town — her breast
having long been out of order. This day, after I had suffered my
own hayre to grow long, in order to wearing it, I find the
convenience of Perrywiggs is so great, that I have cut off all short
again, and will keep to periwigs.
