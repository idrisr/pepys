Lordsday. To Whitehall on foot, calling at my father’s to change
my long black Cloake for a short one (long cloaks being now quite
out); but he being gone to church, Icould not get one, and therefore
I proceeded on and came to my Lord before he went to Chappell;
and so went with him, where I heard Dr. Spurstow preach before
the King a poor dry sermon; but a.very good Anthemne of Capt.
Cookes afterwards. To my Lord’s and dined with him; he all dinner
time talking French to me and telling me the story how the Duke of
Yorke hath got my Lord Chancellors daughter with child, and that
she doth lay it to him. Discoursing concerning what if the Duke
should marry her,® my Lord told me that among his father’s many
old sayings that he had writ in a book of his, thisis one: that he that
doth get a wench with child and marries her afterward it is as if a
man should shit in his hat and then clap it upon his head. I perceive
my Lord is grown a man very indifferent in all matters of Religion,
and so makes nothing of these things. After dinner to the Abby,
where I heard them read the church service, but very Ridiculously,
that endeed I do not in my mind like it at all. A poor cold sermon of
Dr. Lambs, one of the Prebends, in his habitt, came afterwards; and
1. Ship-model.
2. Until the King’s marriage in 1662, Pepys’s references to the ‘Queen’ are to
Henrietta-Maria, the Queen Mother.
3. They had been secretly married on 8 September.
84
so all ended. And by my trotha pitiful sorry devocion it is that these
men pay. So walked home by land. And before supper I read part of
the Maryan persecution in Mr. Fuller. So to supper, prayer, and to
bed.
