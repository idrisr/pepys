Office day. To it all the morning. And dined at home, where
my father came and dined with me — who seems to take much
pleasure to have a son that is neat in his house, I being now making
my new door into the entry, which he doth please himself much
with. After dinner to the office again and there till night. And that
being done, the Comptroller and I to the Miter to a glass of wine —
where we fell in discourse of poetry, and he did repeat some verses
of his own making, which were very good. Home; there hear that
my Lady Batten hath given my wifea visitt (the first that ever she
made her), which pleased me exceedingly. So after supper to bed.
