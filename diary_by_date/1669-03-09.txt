Up, and to the tower and there find Sir W. Coventry alone,
writing down his journall, which he tells me he now keeps of the
material things; [upon] which Itold him, and he is the only man that
Iever told it to I think, that Ihave kept it most strictly these eight or
ten years; and I am sorry almost that I told it him — it not being
necessary, nor may be convenient to have it known. Here he
showed me the petition he had sent to the King by my Lord Keeper;
which was not to desire any admittance to imployment, but
submitting himself therein humbly to his Majesty; but prayed the
removal of his displeasure and that he might be set free. But by this
discourse he was pleased to take occasion to show me and read to
me his account, which he hath kept by him under his own hand, of
all his discourse and the King’s answers to him upon the great
business of my Lord Clarendon. And really, I was mighty proud to
be privy to this great transaction, it giving me great conviction of
the noble nature and ends of Sir W. Coventry in it, and
considerations in general of the consequences of great men’s
actions, and the uncertainty of their estates, and other very serious
considerations.
