Lords day. Up, and put on my new stuff suit with a shoulder-
belt, according to the new fashion, and the hands of my vest and
tunic laced with silk lace of the colour of my suit. And so, very
handsome, to church, where a dull sermon of a stranger. And so
home and there Ifind W. How anda younger brother of his come to
dine with me; and there comes Mercer and brings with her Mrs.
Gayet, which pleased me mightily, and here was also W. Hewers;
and mighty merry and after dinner to sing psalms; but Lord, to hear
what an excellent Base this younger brother of W. How’s sings,
even to my astonishment and mighty pleasant. By and by Gayet
goes away, being a Catholique, to her devotions, and Mercer to
church, but we continued an hour or two singing, and so parted;
QII
and Ito Sir W. Penn’s, and there sent for a hackney coach and he and
she and I out to take the ayre. We went to Stepny and there stopped
at the Trinity house, he to talk with the servants there against
tomorrow, which is a great day for the choice of a new Maister.
And thence to Mile end and there eat and drank; and so home, and I
supped with them; that is, eat some butter and radishes, which is
my excuse for not eating of any other of their victuals, which I hate
because of their sluttery. And so home and made my boy read to me
part of Dr. Wilkins’s new book of the Real Character, and so to bed.
