Christmas day. Lay pretty long in bed. And then rise, leaving
my wife desirous to sleep, having sat up till 4 this morning seeing
her maids make mince pies. I to church, where our parson Mills
made a good sermon. Then home, and dined well on some good
ribbs of beef roasted and mince pies; only my wife, brother, and
Barker, and plenty of good wine of my own; and my heart full of
true joy and thanks to God Almighty for the goodness of my
condition at this day. After dinner I begun to teach my wife and
Barker my song, It is decreed — which pleases me mightily, as now I
have Mr. Hinxton’s bass. Then out, and walked alone on foot to
Temple, it being a fine frost, thinking to have seen a play all alone;
but there missing of any Bills, concluded there was none; and so
back home, and there with my brother, reducing the names of all
my books to an Alphabet, which kept us till 7 or 8 at night; and then
to supper, W. Hewer with us, and pretty merry; and then to my
chamber to enter this day’s journal only, and then to bed.
