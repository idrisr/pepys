Lords day. Up and with my wife to church, where Mr. Mills
721
made an unnecessary sermon upon Originall Sin, neither under-
stood by himself nor the people. Home, where Michell and his
wife, and also there came Mr. Carter, my old acquaintance of
Magdalen College, who hath not been here of many years. He hath
spent his time in the North with the Bishop of Carlisle much. He is
grown a very comely person and of good discourse, and one that I
like very much. We had much talk of all our old acquaintance of the
College, concerning their various fortunes; wherein, to my joy, I
met not with any that have sped better then myself.
