Up, and by and by, about 8 a-clock, comes Rere-Adm.
Kempthorne and seven captains more by the Duke of York’s order,
as we expected, to hold the Court Martiall about the loss of the
Defyance; and so presently, we by boat to the Charles, which lies
over against Upnor Castle, and there we fell to the business; and
there I did manage the business, the Duke of York having by special
order directed them to take the assistance of Commissioner
Middleton and me, forasmuch as there might be need of advice in
what relates to the government of the ship in Harbour; and so I did
lay the law open to them, and rattle the Maister-Attendants out of
their wits almost, and I made the trial last till 7 at night, not eating a
bit all the day; only, when we had done examination and Igiven my
thoughts that the neglect of the gunner of the ship was as great as I
thought any neglect could be, which might by the law deserve
death, but Commissioner Middleton did declare that he was against
giving the sentence of death, we withdrew, as not being of the
1002
Court, and so left them to do what they pleased; and while they
were debating it, the bosun of the ship did bring us out of the Kettle
a piece of hot salt beef and some brown bread and brandy; and there
we did makea little meal, but so good as Inever would desire to eat
. better meat while I live — only, I would have cleaner dishes. By and
by they had done, and called us down from the quarter-deck; and
there we find they do sentence that the gunner of the Defyance
should stand upon the Charles three hours, with his fault writ upon
his breast and with a halter about his neck, and be made uncapable
of any office. The truth is, the man doth seem, and is I believe, a
good man; but his neglect, in trusting a girle to carry fire into his
cabin, is not to be pardoned. This being done, we took boat and
home; and there a good supper was ready for us, which should have
been our dinner. The Captains, desirous to be at London, went
away presently for Gravesend, to get thither by this night’s tide.
And so we to supper, it having been a great snowy and mighty cold
foul day; and so after supper, to bed.
