To Westminster hall, where I found my Lord was last night
voted one of the generalls-at-sea, and Monke the other. I met my
Lord in the Hall, who bade me come to him at noon. I met with Mr.
Pierce the purser, Lieut. Lambert, Mr. Creed, and Will Howe, and
went with them to the Sun Taverne. Up to my office, but did
nothing. At noon home to dinner to a sheep’s head; my Brother
Tom came and dined with me, and told me that my mother was not
very well and that my Aunt Fenner was very ill too. After dinner,I
to Warwick house in Holborne to my Lord, where he dined with
my Lord of Manchester, Sir Dudly North, my Lord Fiennes, and
my Lord Barkly. I stayed in the great hall, talking with some
gentlemen there till they all came out. Then I by coach with my
Lord to Mr. Crews, in our way talking of public things and how I
should look after getting of his Comission’s despatch. He told me
he feared there was new design hatching, as ifMonke had a mind to
get into the saddle. Returning, met with Mr. Gifford, who took me
and gave me half a pint of wine and told me, as I this day hear from
many, that things are in a very doubtful posture, some of the
Parliament being willing to keep the power in their hands. After I
had left him, I met with Tom Harper, who took me toa place in
Drury lane, where we drank a great deal of strong water, more
then ever I did in [my] life at one time before. He talked hog-high
that my Lord Protector would come in place again, which en-
deed is much discoursed of again, though I do not see it possible.
Hence home and writ to my father at Brampton by the post; so
to bed.
