Midsummerday. Up earely and to my office, putting things in
order against wesit. Sit all the morning, and Ibless God Ifind that by
my diligence of late and still, Ido get ground in the office every day.
Atnoonto the change, where! begin to be knownalso. Andso home
to dinner and then to the office, all the afternoon dispatching
business. At night news is brought me that Field, the rogue,’ hath
this day cast me at Guildhall in 30/ for his imprisonment, to which I
signed his commitment with the rest of the officers. But they having
been parliament-men, he hath begun the law with me and threatens
more. But I hope the Duke of Yorke will bear me out.
