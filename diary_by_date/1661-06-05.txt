This morning, did give my wife 4] to lay out upon lace and
other things for herself. I to Wardrobe and so to Whitehall and
Westminster; where I dined with my Lord and Ned Pickering —
alone at his lodgings. After dinner to the office, where we sat and
did business; and then Sir W. Penn and I went home with Sir R.
Slingsby to bowles in his ally and there had good sport; and
afterward went in and drank and talked. So home, Sir William and
I; and it being very hot weather, I took my flagilette and played
upon the leads in the garden, where Sir W. Penn came out in his
shirt into his leads and there we stayed talking and singing and
drinking of great draughts of Clarret and eating botargo and bread
and butter till 12 at night, it being moonshine. And so to bed— very
near fuddled.
