Met with Mr. May, who tells me the story of his being put by
Sir John Denham’s place (of Surveyor of the King’s Works, who it
seems is lately dead) by the unkindness of the Duke of Buck-
ingham, who hath brought in Dr. Wren — though he tells me he
hath been his servant for twenty years together, in all his wants and
dangers, saving him from want of bread by his care and manage-
ment, and with a promise of having his help in his advancement,
and an engagement under his hand for 1oool not yet paid; and yet
the Duke of Buckingham is so ungrateful as to put him by — which
is an ill thing — though Dr. Wren is a worthy man. But he tells me
that the King is kind to him, and hath promised him a pension of
300! a year out of the Works, which will be of more content to him
then the place, which under their present wants of money is a place
that disobliges most people, being not able to do what they desire to
their lodgings.
