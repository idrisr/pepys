Valentine’s day. Up earely and to Sir W. Battens. But would
not go in till I had asked whether they that opened the doore was a
man or a woman. And Mingo, who was there, answered “a
Woman;” which, with his tone, made me laugh. So up I went and
took Mrs. Martha for-my Valentine (which I do only for
complacency), and Sir W. Batten, he go[es] in the same manner to
my wife. And so we were very merry. About 10 a-clock we witha
great deal of company went down by our barge to Deptford; and
there only went to see how forward Mr. Pett’s yacht is. And so all
into the barge again, and so to Woolwich on board the Rosebush,
Capt. Brown’s ship, that is brother-in-law to Sir W. Batten—- where
we hada very fine dinner dressed on shoare. And great mirth and all
things sucessefull — the first time I ever carried my wife a-shipboard
—as also my boy Waineman, who hath all this day been called
‘“young Pepys”, as Sir W. Pen’s boy “‘young Pen”. The talk ofthe
towne now is, who the King is like to have for his Queene — and
whether Lent shall be kept with the strictnesse of the King’s
proclamacion; which it is thought cannot be, because of the poor,
who cannot buy fish — and also the great preparacion for the King’s
crowning is now much thought upon and talked of.
1s. At the office all the morning. And in the afternoon at making
up my accounts for my Lord. And that being done, I find myself to
be clear (as I think) 350/ in the world, besides my goods in my
house, and all things paid for.
