Upandto the office, where all the morning; and at noon home
to dinner, Mr. Sheres dining with us by agreement, and my wife,
which troubled me, mighty careful to have a handsome dinner for
him. But yet I see no reason to be troubled at it, he being a very civil
and worthy man think; but only, it doth seem to imply some little
neglect of me. After dinner to the King’s House and there saw The
Generall revived, a good play, that pleases me well; and thence, our
coach coming for us, we parted and home, and I busy late at the
office and then home to supper and to bed — well pleased tonight to
have Lead the vizard-maker bring me home my vizard with a Tube
fastened to it, which I think will do my business, at least in a great
measure, for the easing of my eyes.
