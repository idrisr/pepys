All morning at the office, Harman being come, to my great
satisfaction, to put up my beds and hangings; so I am at rest, and
fallowed my business all day. Dined with Sir W. Batten. Mighty
busy about this account, and while my people were busy, myself
wrote near 30 letters and orders with my own hand. At it till 11 at
night; and it is strange to see how clear my head was, being eased of
all the matter of all those letters; whereas one would think that I
should have been dozed — I never did observe so much of myself in
my life. In the evening there comes to me Capt. Cocke, and walked
a good while in the garden; he says he hath computed that the rents
of houses lost this fire in the City comes to 600000! per annum. That
this will make the Parliament more quiet then otherwise they
would have been and give the King a more ready supply. That the
supply must be by excise, as it is in holland. That the Parliament
will see it necessary to carry on the war. That the late storm
hindered our beating the Duch fleet, who were gone out only to
satisfy the people, having no business to do but to avoid us. That
the French, as late in the year as it is, are coming. That the Duch are
really in bad condition, but that this unhappiness of ours doth give
them heart. That, certainly, never so great a loss as this was borne
so well by citizens in the world as this; he believing that not one
merchant upon the Change will break upon it. That he doth not
apprehend there will be any disturbances in estate upon it, for that
671
all men are busy in looking after their own business, to save
themselfs. He gone, I to finish my letters; and home to bed and find,
to my infinite joy, many rooms clean, and myself and wife lie in our
own chamber again. But much terrified in the nights nowadays,
with dreams of fire and falling down of houses.
