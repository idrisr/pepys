At the office all the morning; and at noonIreceive a letter
from Mr. Creed with a token, viz., a very noble parti-coloured
Indian gowne for my wife. The letter is oddly writ, over-prizing his
present and little owning any past service of mine, but that this was
his genuine respects and I know not what. I confess I had
expectations of a better account from him of my service about his
accounts, and so gave his boy 12d. and sent it back again. And after
having been at the pay of a ship this afternoon at the Treasury, |
went by coach to Ludgate; and by pricing several there, I guess this
gowne may be worth about 12 or 15/. But however, Iexpect at least
sol of him. So in the evening I wrote himaletter telling him clearly
my mind, a copy of which I keep, and his letter; and so I resolve to
have no more such correspondence as I used to have, but will have
satisfaction of him as Ido expect. So to write my letters; and after all
done, I went home to supper and to bed — my mind being pretty
well at ease from my letter to Creed, and more for my receipt this
afternoon of 17/ at the Treasury, for the 17/ paid a year since to the
Carver for his work at my house, whichI did entend to have paid
myself; but finding others to do it, I thought it not amisse to gett it
too — but I am afeared that we may hear of it to our greater
prejudices hereafter.
