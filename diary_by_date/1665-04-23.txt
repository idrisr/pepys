Lords day. Mr. Povy, according to promise, sent his coach
betimes, and I carried my wife and her woman to Whitehall chapel
and set them in the Organ loft. And I, having list to untruss, went to
the Harp and ball, and there drank also, and entertained myself in
talk with the maid of the house, a pretty maid and very modest.
Thence to the chapel and heard the famous young Stillingfleete,
who I knew at Cambridge and is now newly admitted one of the
King’s chaplains — and was presented, they say, to my Lord
Treasurer for St. Andrews Holborne, where he is now minister,
with these words: that they (the Bishops of Canterbury, London,
and another) believed he is the ablest young man to preach the
gospel of any since the Apostles. He did make the most plain,
honest, good, grave sermon, in the most unconcerned and easy yet
substantial manner, that ever I heard in my life—upon the words of
Samuell to the people — “Fear the Lord in truth with all your heart,
and remember the great things that he hath done for you”’ —it being
proper to this day, the day of the King’s Coronation. Thence to Mr.
Povy’s, where mightily treated, and Creed with us. But Lord, to
see how Povy overdoes everything in commending it doth make it
nauseous to me, and was not (by reason of my large praise of his
house) over-acceptable to my wife. Thence after dinner Creed and
we by coach; took the ayre in the fields beyond St. Pancras, it
raining now and then; which it seems is most welcome weather.
And then all to my house — where comes Mr. Hill, Andrews, and
Capt. Taylor, and good Musique; but at supper, to hear the
arguments we had against Taylor concerning a Corant — he saying
that the law of a dancing Corant is to have every barr to end in a
pricked Crochet and quaver— which Idid deny, was very strange. It
proceeded till I vexed him; but all parted friends, for Creed and I to
laugh at when he was gone. After supper Creed and I together to
bed in Mercer’s bed — and so to sleep. :
