This day dined Sir John Boys and some other gentlemen,
formerly great Cavaliers; and among the rest, one Mr. Norwood,
for whom my Lord gave a convoy to carry him to the Brill; but he is
certainly going to the King — for my Lord commanded me that I
should not enter his name in my book. My Lord doth show them
and that sort of people great civility. All their discourse and others’
are of the King’s coming, and we begin to speak of it very freely.
And heard how in many churches in London and upon many signs
there and upon merchants’ ships in the river they have set up the
King’s arms. In the afternoon the Captain would by all means have
me up to his cabin; and there treated me huge nobly, giving me a
barrel of pickled oysters, and opened another for me, anda bottle of
wine, which was a very great favour. At night late singing with W.
Howe, and under the barber’s hands in the coach. This night there
came one witha letter from Mr.: Edwd. Mountagu to my Lord,
with command to deliver it to his own hand. I do believe that he
doth carry some close business on for the King.
