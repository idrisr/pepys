Up, and out with Capt. Witham in several places again to look
for Oates for Tanger. And among other places, to the City
Granarys, where it seems every company have their granary, and
obliged to keep such a quantity of Corne alway there, or at a time of
scarcity to issue so much at so mucha bushell. Andafine thing it is
to see their stores of all sorts for piles for the bridge and for pipes—a
thing I never saw before. Thence to the office and there busy all the
morning. At noon to my uncle Wights and there dined, my wife
being there all the morning. After dinner to Whitehall and there met
with Mr. Pierce and he showed me the Queen’s bedchamber and
her closet, where she had nothing but some pretty pious pictures
and books of devotion. And her holy water at her head as she sleeps,
with a clock by her bedside wherein a lamp burns that tells her the
time of the night at any time. Thence with him to the park and there
met the Queen coming from chappell, with her Maids of honour all
in Silver lace gowns. Thence he carried me to the King’s closet;
where such variety of pictures and other things of value and rarity,
that I was propexly confounded and enjoyed no pleasure in the sight
of them — which is the only time in my life that ever Iwas so ata loss
for pleasure in the greatest plenty of objects to give it me.
