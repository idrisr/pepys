Christmas day. In the morning to church; where Mr. Mills
made a very good sermon. After that home to dinner, where my
wife and I and my brother Tom (who this morning came to see my
wife’s new mantle put on, which doth please me very well) — to a
good shoulder of Mutton and a Chicken. After dinner to church
again, my wife and I, where we have a dull sermon of a stranger
which made me sleep; and so home; and I, before and after supper,
to my Lute and Fullers History, at which I stayed all alone in my
Chamber till 12 at night; and so to bed.
