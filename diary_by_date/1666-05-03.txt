Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon home, and
contrary to my expectation find my little girl Su worse then she
was, which troubled me; and the more to see my wife minding her
painting, and not thinking of her house business (this being the first
day of her beginning the second time to paint). This together made
me froward, that I was angry with my wife and would not have
Browne! to think to dine at my table with me always, being
desirous to have my house to myself, without a stranger and
Mechanique to be privy to all my concernments. Upon this my
wife and I hadalittle disagreement, but it ended by and by. And
then to send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home, and
would have given anything; I offered to the only one that we could
get 20s. per week, and we to find clothes and bedding and physic.
And would have given 30s. as demanded, but desired an hour or
two’s time. So I away by water to Westminster and there sent for
the girl’s mother to Westminster hall to me; she came, and
undertakes to get her daughter a lodging and nurse at next door to
her, though she dare not, for the parish sake (whose sexton her
husband is), to [take] her into her own house. Thence home, calling
at my bookseller’s and other trifling places, three or four, and so
home. And in the evening the mother came, and with a nurse she
hath got, who demanded, andI did agree at, xs. per week to take
her. And so she away — and my house mighty uncouth, having so
few in it, and we shall want a servant or two by it. And the truth is,
my heart was a
little sad all the afternoon, and jealous of myself. But
she went, and we all glad of it. And soa
little to the office; and so to
home to supper and to bed.
