Several people to me about business; among others, Capt.
Taylor, intended Storekeeper for Harwich, whom Idid give some
assistance in his despatch — by lending him money. So out, and by
water to London, and to the Change and up and down about several
businesses. And after the observing (God forgive me) one or two of
my neighbour hermosa mohers come to town, which did please me
very well, home to my house at the office, where my wife had gota
dinner for me. And it was a joyful thing for us to meet here — for
which God be praised. Here was her brother, come to see her and
$59
speak with me about business — it seems my recommending of him
hath not only obtained presently being admitted into the Duke of
Albemarle’s guard and present pay — but also, by the Dukes and Sir
Ph. Howards directions, to be put as a right-hand man, and other
marks of special respect; at which I am very glad, partly for him,
and partly to see that I am reckoned something in my recommenda-
tions — but wish he may carry himself that I may receive no disgrace
by him. Upon the Change today, Colvill tells me from Oxford that
the King in person hath justified my Lord Sandwich to the highest
degree — and is right in his favour to the uttermost. So late by water
home, taking a barrel of oysters with me; and at Greenwich went
and sat with Madam Penington, con laquelle je faisais almost
whatever je voudrais — con mi mano, sino tocar la chose méme; and
Iwas very near it, and made her undress her head and set dishevelled
all night, sporting till two in the morning; and so away to my
lodging, almost cloyed with this dalliance, and so to bed. Over-
fasting all the morning hath filled me mightily with wind, and
nothing else hath done it, that I fear a fit of the Cholique.
