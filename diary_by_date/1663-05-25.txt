Up; and my pill workingalittle, I stayed within most of the
morning. Ashwell did by and by come to me with an errand from
her mistress, to desire money to buy a country suit for her against
she goes as we talked last night; and soI did give her 4l and believe it
will cost me the best part of
4more to fit her out; but with peace and
honour, I am willing to spare anything so as to be able to keep all
ends together and my power over her undisturbed. Mr. Alsopp the
King’s Brewer tells me ofa horseofhis that lately, after four days’
pain, voided at his fundament four stones, bigger then that Iwas cut
of, very heavy and in the middle of each of them either a piece of
Iron or wood. The King hath twoofthem in his closet, anda third,
the College of Physicians to keep for rarities; and by the King’s
command he causes the turd of the horse to be every day searched to
find more.
