This morning Sir W. Pen and I to the Treasury office; and
there we paid off the Amity and another ship, and so home; and after
dinner Sir Wm. came to me, and he and his son and daughter and I
and my wife by Coach to Moorefields to walk (but it was most
foule weather); and so we went into an alehouse and there eat some
cakes and ale; and a Washeall-bowle woman and girl came to us and
sung to us; and after all was done, I called my boy (Waynman) to us
to eat some cake that was left, and the woman of the house told us
that he had called for two Cakes and a pot of ale for himself, at
which I was angry and am resolved to correct him for it. So home;
and Sir W. Penn and his son and daughter to supper to me to a good
Turkey, and were merry at Cards; and so to bed.
