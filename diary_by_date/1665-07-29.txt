Up betimes. And after viewing some of wife’s pictures,
which now she is come to do very finely, to my great satisfaction,
beyond what I could ever look for — 1 went away; and by water to
the office, where nobody to meet me, but busy all the morning. At
noon to dinner, where Ihear that my Will is come in thither and laid
down upon my bed, ill of the headake; which put me into
extraordinary fear, and I studied all I could to get him out of the
house, and set my people to work to do it without discouraging
him. Writing of letters hard; and then at night home and fell to my
Tanger Papers —till late; and then to bed—in some ease of mind that
Will is gone to his lodging and that he is likely to do well, it being
only the the headake.
