Up; and after sending my wife to my aunt Wight’s to get a
place to see Turner’ hanged, I to the office, where we sat all the
morning. And at noon, going to the Change and seeing people
flock in that, I enquired and found that Turner was not yet hanged;
and so I went among them to Leadenhall street at the end of Lyme
street, near where the robbery was done, and to St. Mary Axe,
where he lived; and there Igot for a shilling to stand upon the wheel
of a Cart, in great pain, above an hour before the execution was
done -—he delaying the time by long discourses and prayers one after
another, in hopes of a reprieve; but none came, and at last was flung
off the lather in his cloak. A comely-looked man he was, and kept
his countenance to the end —I was sorry to see him. It was believed
there was at least 12 or 14000 people in the street.
