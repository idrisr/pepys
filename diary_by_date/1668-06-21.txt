Lords day. Up, and to church; and home and dined with my
wife and Deb alone, but merry and in good humour; which is,
when all is done, the greatest felicity of all. And after dinner, she to
read in the IIlustr. Bassa. And so to church, I alone, and thence to see
Sir W. Penn, whois ill again; and then home-—and there get my wife
to read to me till supper, and then to bed.
