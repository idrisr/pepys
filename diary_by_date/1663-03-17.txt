Up betimes and to my office a while, and then home and to Sir
Wm. Batten; with whom by coach to St. Margaretts hill in
Southworke, where the Judge of the Admiralty came and the rest of
the Doctors of the Civill law and some other Comissioners; whose
Commission of Oyer and Terminer was read, and then the charge
given by Dr. Exton — which methought was somewhat dull,
though he would seem to entend it to be very Rhetoricall, saying
thatJustice had two wings, one of which spread itself over the land
and the other over the water, which was this Admiralty court. That
being done and the Jury called, they broke up and to dinner to a
Taverne hard by, where a great dinner, and I with them; but I
perceive that their design and consultation was, I could overhear
them, how to proceed with the most solemnity and spend time,
there being only two businesses to do, which of themselfs would
not spend much time. So home, with my mind at very great ease,
over the water to the Tower; and thence, there being nobody at the
office, we being absent and so no office could be kept — Sir W.
Batten and I to my Lord Mayors, where we found my Lord with
Coll. Strangways and Sir Rd. Floyd, Parliament men, in the cellar
drinking; where we sat with them and then up, and by and by
comes in Sir Rd. Ford. In our drinking, which was alway going, we
had many discourses; but from all of them, I do find Sir R. Ford a
very able man of his brains and tongue, anda Scholler. But my Lord
Mayor I find to be a talking, bragging Bufflehead, a fellow that
263
would be thought to have led all the City in the great business of
bringing in the King; and that nobody understood his plots and the
dark lanthorn he walked by, but led them and plowed with them as
oxen and Asses (his own words) to do what he had a mind— when in
every discourse, I observe him to be as very a coxcomb as I could
have thought had been in the City.
