In the morning we all went to church and sat in the pew
belonging to us. Where a cold sermon of a young [man] that never
hath preached before. Here Comissioner Pett came with his wife
and daughters — the eldest, being his wife’s daughter, is a very
comely black woman. So to the globe to dinner. By Coach to
Greenwich church, where a good sermon, a
fine church, anda great
company of handsome women. After sermon to Deptford again,
where at the Comissioners and the globe we stayed long. And so I
to Mr. Davis’s to bed again. But no sooner in bed but we have an
alarme and so we rise. And the Comptroller comes into the yard to
us — and seamen of all the ships present repair to us; and there we
armed, with everyone a handspike, with which they were as fierce
as could be. At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did
ride through the guard in the towne without stopping to the guard
that was there and some say shot at them. But all being quiett there,
we caused the seamen to go on board again; and so we all to bed
(after I had sat awhile with Mr. Davis in his study, which is filled
with good books and some very good song bookes): I likewise to
bed.
