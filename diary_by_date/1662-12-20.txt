To Whitehall where we met upon the Tanger Commission —
and discoursed many things thereon. But little will be done before
my Lord Rutherford comes there as to the Fortificacions or Molle.
That done, my Lord Sandwich and I walked together a good while
in the Matted Gallery, he acquainting me with his late enquiries into
the Wardrobe business, to his content; and tells me how things
stand — and that the first year was worth about 3000! to him and the
next about as much; so that at this day, if he were paid, it will be
worth about 7000! to him.
