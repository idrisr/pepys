Lords day. Up and to church. At noon comes unexpected Mr.
Fuller the Minister, and dines with me — and also I had invited Mr.
Cooper, with one Ijudge came from sea. And he and I spent the
whole afternoon together, he teaching me some things in under-
standing of plats. At night to the office doing business, and then
home to supper; then a psalm, to prayers, and to bed.
