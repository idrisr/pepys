To Westminster about several businesses. Then to dine with
my Lady at the Wardrobe — taking Deane Fuller along with me.
Then home, where I heard that my father had been to find me out
about special business; so I took coach and went to him; and find by
a letter to him from my aunt that my uncle Robert is taken with a
dizzinesse in his head. So that they desire my father to come downe
to look after his business — by which we guess that he is very ill; and
so my father doth think to go tomorrow. And so God’s will be
done. Back by water to the office. There till night; and so home to
my musique and then to bed.
