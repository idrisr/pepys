Lords day. Up; and it being late, to church. I found that my
coming in a perriwigg did not prove so strange to the world as Iwas
afeared it would, for I thought that all the church would presently
have cast their eye all upon me — but I found no such thing. Here an
ordinary lazy sermon of Mr. Mills, and then home to dinner and
there Tom came and dined with us; and after dinner, to talk about a
new black cloth-suit that Ihave a-making; and so at church time I to
church again — where the Scott preached, and I slept most of the
time. Thence home and I spent most of the evening upon Fullers
Church History and Barcklys Argenis; and so after supper to prayers
and to bed.
