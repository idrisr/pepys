Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and then to
the Change, where after some stay, by coach with Sir
J.Mennes and
Mr. Coventry to St. James and there dined with Mr. Coventry very
finely; and so over the park to Whitehall to a Committee of Tanger
about providing provisions, money, and men for Tanger. At it all

to my office a while and home to supper and bed — being now in
constant pain in my back; but whether it be only wind or what it is,
the Lord knows; but I fear the worst.
