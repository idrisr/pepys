Sunday. Whitsunday. The barber having done with me, I went
to church and there heard a good sermon of Mr. Mills, fit for the
day.Then home to dinner. And then to church again. And going
home, I find Gratorex (whom I expected today at dinner) come to
see me. And so he andI in my chamber, drinking of wine and eating
of anchoyes an hour or two — discoursing of many things in
Mathematiques; and among other, he showed me how it comes to
pass the strength that Levers have; and he showed me that what is
got as to matter of strength is lost by them as to matter of time. It
rained very hard (as it hath done of late, so much that we begin to
doubt a famine); and so he was forced to stay longer then I desired.
