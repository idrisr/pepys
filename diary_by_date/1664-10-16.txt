Lords day. It raining, we set out; and about 9 a-clock got to
Hatfield in church-time, and I light and saw my simple Lord
Salsbury sit there in his gallery. Stayed not in the church; but thence
mounted again, and to Barnett by the end of sermon and there
dined at the Red Lyon. Very weary again, but all my weariness
yesterday night and today in my thighs only, the rest of my
weariness in my shoulders and arms being quite gone. Thence
home, parting company at my Cosen Anth. Joyces by 4 a-clock.
Weary, but very well, to bed at home, where I find all well. Anon
my wife came to bed; but for my ease rose again and lay with her
woman.
