Upearely and to my office — where people came to me about
business, and by and by we met on purpose to inquire into the
business of the Flaggmakers, where I am the person that doth
chiefly manage the business against them on the King’s part; and I
do find it the greatest cheat that I have yet found — they having 84d.
per yard allowed them by pretence of a contract, when no such
thing appears; and it is 3d. more then was formerly paid and then I
now offer the Board to have them done.
