I went forth about my own business to buya pair of riding
gray serge Stockings, a sword and belt and shoes. And after that
took Wotton and Brigden to the Popes head tavern in Chancery
lane, where Gilb. Holland and Shelston was; and we dined and
drank a great deal of wine, and they paid all. Strange how these
people do now promise me anything; one a Rapier, the other a
vessel of wine or a gown, and offered me his silver hatband to [do]
him a courtesy. I pray God keep me from being proud or too much
lifted up hereby.
