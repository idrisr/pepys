To my Lord Crews. By and by came in great Mr. Swinfen,
the parliament-man — who, among other discourse of the rise and
fall of familys, told us of Bishop Bridgeman (brother of Sir
Orlando) who lately hath bought a seat anciently of the Lever and
then the Ashtons; and so he hath in his great hall window (having
repaired and beautified the house) hath caused four great places to
be left for Coates of armes. In one he hath put the Lever’s, with this
motto, Olim. In another the Ashton’s, with this, Heri. In the next,
his own, with this, Hodie. In the fourth, nothing but this motto,
Cras nescio cujus. Thence towards my brother’s; met with Jacke Cole
in Fleete streete and he and I went into his Cosen Mary Coles
(whom Inever saw since she was married) and drank a pint of wine,
and much good discourse. I find himalittle conceited, but he hath
good things in him and a man may know the temper of the City by
him, he being ofa general conversation and can tell how matters go;
and upon that score, I will encourage his acquaintance.
