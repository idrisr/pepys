Up betimes, and prepared to my great Satisfaction an account
for the Board of my office disbursements, which I had suffered to
run on to almost 120/. That done, I down by water to Greenwich,
where we met the first day, my Lord Brouncker, Sir
J.Mennes, and
I, and Ithink we shall do well there. And begun very auspiciously to
me, by having my account abovesaid passed and put into a way of
having it presently paid. We parted at my Lord Brunckers door —
where I went in (having never been there before) — and there he
made a noble entertainment for Sir
J.Mennes, myself, and Capt.
Cocke; none else — saving some painted lady that dined there, I
know not who she is.' But very merry we were. Thence I by water
home, in my way seeing a man taken up dead out of the Hold of
a
small ketch that lay at Deptford; I doubt it might be the plague,
which, with the thought of Dr. Burnett, did something disturb me,
so that I did not what I entended and should have done at the office
as to business. But home sooner then ordinary; and after supper to
read melancholy alone, and then to bed. :
