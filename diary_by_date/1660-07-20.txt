Wesat at the office this morning (Sir W. Batten and Mr. Pett
being upon a Survey to Chatham): this morning I sent my wife to
my father’s and with him to go buy s/-worth of pewter. After we
rose at the office, I went to my father’s, where my uncle Fenner and
all his crew and Capt. Holland and his wife and my wife were at
dinner at a venison pasty, of the venison that I did give my mother
the other night. I did this time show so much coldness to W. Joyce
that I believe all the table took notice of it. Home and to bed.
