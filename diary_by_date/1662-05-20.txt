Sir W. Penn and I did a little business at the office, and so
home again. Then comes Deane Fuller after we had dined, but I got
something for him; and very merry we were for an houre or two,
and I am most pleased with his company and goodness. At last
parted, and my wife and I by coach to the Opera and there saw the
second part of Seige of Rhodes, but it is not so well done as when
Roxalana was there — who, it is said, is now owned by my Lord of
Oxford. Thence to tower wharfe and there took boat; and we all
walked to halfeway house and there eat and drunk — and were
pleasant; and so finally home again in the evening, and so good-
night — this being a very pleasant life that we now lead, and have
long done; the Lord be blessed and make us thankful. But though I
am much against too much spending, yet I do think it best to enjoy
some degree of pleasure, now that we have health, money and
opportunities, rather then to leave pleasures to old age or poverty,
when we cannot have them so properly.
