Up; and after some discourse with Mr. Duke, who is to be
Secretary to the Fishery and is now Secretary to the Committee for
Trade, whoI find a very ingenious man, I went to Mr. Povys and
there hearda little of his empty discourse; and fain he would have
Mr. Gauden been the victualler for Tanger, which none but a fool
would say to me, when he knows he hath made it his request to me
to get him something of these men that now do it. Thence to St.
James’s; but Mr. Coventry being ill and in bed, Idid not stay, but to
Whitehall a little, walked up and down, and so home to fit papers
against the afternoon. And after dinner to the Change a little and
then to Whitehall, where anon the Duke of Yorke came and a
Committee we had of Tanger; where I read over my rough draft of
the contract for Tanger Victualling and acquainted them with the
death of Mr. Alsopp, which Mr. Lanyon had told me this morning
— which isa sad consideration, to see how uncertain a thing our lives
are and how little to be presumed of in our greatest undertakings.
The words of the contract approved of, and I home; and there came
Mr. Lanyon to me and brought my neighbour Mr. Andrews to me,
whom he proposes for his partener in the room of Mr. Alsopp; andI
like well enough of it. We read over the contract together and
discoursed it well over, and so parted; and I am glad to see it once
over in this condition again, for Mr. Lanyon and I had some
discourse today about my share in it; and I hope, if it goes on, to
have my first hopes of 300! per annum. They gone, I to supper and
to bed. This afternoon came my great store of Coles in, being ten
Chaldron, so that I may see how long they will last me.
