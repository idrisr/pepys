In the morning, before I went forth, old East brought me a
dozen of bottles of sack and I gave hima shilling for his pains. Then
Iwent to Mr. Sheply, who was drawing of sack in the wine-cellar to
send to other places as a gift from my Lord,’ and told me that my
Lord hath given him order to give me the dozen of bottles. Then I
went to Mr. Crew’s and borrowed tol: of Mr. Andrewes for my
own use; and so went to my office, where there was nothing to do.
Then I walked a great while in Westminster hall, where Iheard that
Lambert was coming up to London. Great talk that many places
have declared for a free Parliament; and it is believed that they will
be forced to fill up the House with the old members. From the HallI
called at home, and so went to Mr. Crew’s (my wife, she was to go
to her father’s), thinking to have dined; but I came too late. So Mr.
Moore and Iand another Gentleman went out and drank a cup of ale
together in the new market, and there I eat some bread and cheese
for my dinner. After that, Mr. Moore and I went as far as Fleet
street together and parted. Then Iwent home, and finding my wife
gone to see Mrs. Hunt, I went to Will’s and there sat with Mr.
Ashwell talking and singing till 9 a-clock, and so home. There,
having not eat anything but bread and cheese, my wife cut mea slice
of brawn whichIreceived from mry Lady,” which proves as good as
ever I had any. So to bed, and my [wife] had a very bad nightofit
through wind and cold.
