With my Lord to the Duke, where he spoke to Mr. Coventry
to despatch my business of the Acts, in which place everybody
gives me joy, as if I were in it; which God send. Dined with my
Lord and all his officers of his Regiment, who invited my Lord and
his friends, as many as he would bring, to dinner at the Swan at
Dowgate, a poor house and ill dressed but very good fish and
plenty. To Westminster and with W. Howe by coach to the
Speaker’s, where my Lord supped with the King; but we could not
get in. So back again; and after a song or two in my chamber in the
dark, which doth (now that the bed is out) sound very well, I went
home and to bed.
