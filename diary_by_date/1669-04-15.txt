Up and to the office; and thence, before the office sat, to the
Excise Office with W. Hewer, but found some occasion to go
another way to the Temple upon business; and I, by Deb’s
direction, did know whither in Jewen street to direct my hackney
coachman, while I stayed in the coach in Aldgate street, to go
thither first to enquire whether Mrs. Hunt her aunt was in town,
who brought me word she was not; I thought this was as muchas I
could do'at once, and therefore went away, troubled though that I
could do no more; but to the office I must go, and did, and there all
the morning; but coming thither, I find Bagwell’s wife, who did
give mea little note into my hand, whereinIfind her para invite me
para meet her in Moorfields this noon, where I might speak with
her; and so after the office was up, my wife being gone before by
invitation to my cousin Turner’s to dine, I to that place; and there,
after walking up and down by the windmills, I did find her and talk
with her; but it being holiday and the place full of people, we
parted, leaving further discourse and doing to another time: thence
I away and through Jewen street, my mind, God knows, running
that way, but stopped not; but going down Holburn hill by the
Conduit, I did see Deb on foot going up the hill; I saw her, and she
me, but she made no stop, but seemed unwilling to speak to me; so I
away on, but then stopped and light and after her, and overtook her
at the end of Hosier lane in Smithfield; and without standing in the
street, desired her to fallow me, and I led her intoa little blind
alehouse within the walls; and there she and I alone fell to talk and
besar la and tocar su mamelles, but she mighty coy, and I hope
modest; but however, though with great force, did hazer ella con su
hand para tocar mi thing, but ella was in great pain para be brought
para it. I did give her in a paper 20s., and we did agree para meet
again in the Hall at Westminster on Monday next; and so, giving
me great hopes by her carriage that she continues modest and
honest, we did there part, she going home and I to Mrs. Turner’s;
but when I came back to the place where I left my coach, it was
gone, I having stayed too long, which did trouble me to abuse a
poor fellow so; but taking another coach, Idid direct him to find out
the fellow and send him to me.
