To a bookseller’s in the Strand and there bought Hudibras
again, it being certainly some ill humour to be so set against that
which all the world cries up to be the example of wit — for which I
am resolved once again to read him and see whetherI can find it or
no. So to Mr. Povys and there find them at dinner and dined there —
there being, among others, Mr. Williamson, Latin Secretary, who
I
perceive is a pretty knowing man anda scholar, but it may be thinks
himself to be too much so. Thence after dinner to the Temple to my
Cosen Roger Pepys, where met us my uncle Tho. and his son; and
after many high demands, we at last came to a kind of agreement
upon very hard terms, which are to be prepared in writing. My
Cosen Roger was so sensible of our coming to agreement that he

office, setting business in order; and so home to supper and to bed
— my mind being in disorder as to the greatness of this day’s
business that I have done, but yet glad that my trouble therein is
like to be over.
