Up and to the office, where all the morning doing business.
And at noon to the Change and there very busy; and so home to
dinner with my wife to a good hog’s harslet, a piece of meat I love
but have not eat of I think this seven year. And after dinner abroad
by coach, set her at Mrs. Hunts and I to Whitehall; and at the Privy
Seale office enquired and found the Bill come for the Corporation
of the Royall Fishery; whereof the Duke of Yorke is made present
Governor and several other very great persons, to the number of
32, made his assistants for their lives: whereof, by my Lord
Sandwichs favour, I am one and take it not only as a matter of
honour but that that may come to be of profit to me. And so with
great content went and called my wife; and so home and to the
office, where busy late; and so home to supper and to bed.
