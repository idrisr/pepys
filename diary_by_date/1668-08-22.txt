Up betimes, at it again with great content, and so to office I,
where all the morning; and did fall out with W. Penn about his
slight performance of his office; and so home to dinner, fully
satisfied that this office must sink or the whole service be undone.
To the office all the afternoon again; and then home to supper and to
bed, my mind being pretty well at ease, my great letter being now
finished to my full content; and I thank God I have opportunity of
doing it, though I know it will set the office and me by the ears for
ever. This morning Capt. Cocke comes and tells me that he is now
assured that it is true what he told me the other day, that our whole
office will be turned out, only me; which, whether he says true or
no, I know not nor am much concerned, though I should be better
contented to have it thus then otherwise. This afternoon, after I was
938
weary in my business of the office, I went forth to the Change,
thinking to have spoken with Capt. Cocke, but he was not within.
So Ihome, and took London bridge in my way, walking down Fish
street and Gracious street to see how very fine a descent they have
now made down the hill, that it is become very easy and pleasant.
And going through Leadenhall, it being market-day, I did see a
woman ketched that had stolen a shoulder of mutton off of a
butcher’s stall, and carrying it wrapped up ina cloth ina basket. The
jade was surprized, and did not deny it; and the woman so silly that
took it as to let her go, only taking the meat.
