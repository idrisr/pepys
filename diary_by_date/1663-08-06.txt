AtnoonI to the Change; and meeting with Sir W. Warren, toa
Coffee-house and there finished a contract with him for the office,
and so parted. And I to my Cosen Mary Joyces at a Gossiping,
where much company and good Cheere. There was the King’s
falconer that lives by Pauls and his wife, a ugly pusse but brought
him money. He speaking of the strength of hawkes, which will
strike a fowle to the ground with that force that shall make the fowl
rebound a great way from [the] ground, which no force of man or
art can do. But it was very pleasant to hear what reasons he and
another, one Ballard, a rich man of the same company of
Leathersellers of which the Joyces are, did give for this. Ballards
wife, a pretty and a very well-bred woman; I took occasion to kiss
several times, and she to carve, drink and show me great respect.
After dinner, to talk and laugh. I drank no wine, but sent for some
water, the beer not being good. A fidler was sent for; and there one
Mrs. Lurkin, a neighbour, a good and merry poor woman, but a
very tall woman, did dance and show such tricks that made us all
300
merry. But above all, a daughter of Mr. Brumfield’s, black but
well-shaped and modest, did dance very well, which pleased me
mightily; and Ibegun the Duchesse with her, but could not do it; but
however, I came off well enough and made mighty much of her,
kissing and leading her home with her Cosen Anthony and Kate
Joyce (Kate being very handsome and well, that is, handsomely
dressed today, and I grew mighty kind and familiar with her and
kissed her soundly, which she takes very well). To their house and
there I left them — having on our way, though 9 a-clock at night,
carried them into a puppet-play in Lincolnes Inn fields; where there
was the Story of Holofernes and other clockwork, well done. So I
walked home, very well contented with this afternoon’s work, I
thinking it convenient to keep in withthe Joyces against a bad day,
if |should have occasion to make use of them.
