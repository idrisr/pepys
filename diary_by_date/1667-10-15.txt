Up, and to the office; where Sir W. Penn being ill of the gout,
we all of us met there in his parlour and did the business of the
office, our greatest business now being to manage the pay of the
ships in order and with speed, to satisfy the Commissioners of the
Treasury. This morning my brother set out for Brampton again,
and is gone. At noon home to dinner; and thence my wife and I and
Willett to the Duke of York’s House, where after long stay the King
and Duke of York came, and there saw The Coffee house, the most
ridiculous, insipid play that ever I saw in my life—and glad we were
that Baterton had no part in it. But here, before the play begin, my
wife begin to complain to me of Willetts confidence in sitting cheek
by jowl by us; which was a poor thing, but I perceive she is already
jealous of my kindness to her, so that I begin to fear this girl is not
likely to stay long with us. The play done, we home by coach, it
being moonlight; and got well home, and I to my chamber to settle
some papers, and so to supper and to bed.
