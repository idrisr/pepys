Lords day. Up, and with my wife and two girls to church, they
very fine; and so home, where comes my Cosen Roger and his wife
(I having sent for them) to dine with us, and there comes in by
chance also Mr. Sheply, who is come to town with my Lady
Paulina, who is desperately sick and is gone to Chelsy to the old
house where my Lord himself was once sick — where I doubt my
Lord means to visit her, more for young Mrs. Beck’s sake then for
hers. Here we dined with W. Battelier and W. Hewer with us (these
two girls making it necessary that they be always with us, for lam
not company light enough to be always merry with them); and so
sat talking all the afternoon, and then Sheply went away first, and
then to my cousin Roger and his wife; and so I to my office to write
down my journall, and so home to my chamber to doalittle
business there, my papers being in mighty disorder and likely so to
continue while these girls are with us. In the evening comes W.
Batelier and his sisters and supped and talked with us, and so spent
the evening, myself being somewhat out of order because of my
eyes, which have never been well since last Sundy’s reading at Sir
W. Coventry’s chamber. And so after supper to bed.
