Troubled, about 3 in the morning, with my wife’s calling her
maid up, and rising herself, to go with her coach abroad to gather
May-dew' — which she did; and I troubled for it, for fear of any
hurt, going abroad so betimes, happening to her. But I to sleep
again, and she came home about 6 and to bed again, all well. And I
up, and with Mr. Gibson by coach to St. James and thence to
Whitehall, where the Duke of York met the office and there
discoursed of several things, perticularly the instructions to
commanders of ships. Thence walked, my boy Jacke with me, to
my Lord Crew, whom I have not seen since he was sick, which is
eight months ago I think — and there dined with him. He is mightily
broke. A stranger, a country gentleman, was with him, and he
pleased with my discourse accidentally about the decay of gentle-
men’s families in the country, telling us that the old rule was that a
family might remain 50 miles from London 100 year, 100 mile off
from London 200 years, and so, farther or nearer London, more or
less years. He also told us that he hath heard his father say that in his
time it was so rare for a country gentleman to come to London, that
when he did come, he used to make his will before he set out.
Thence walkedalittle with Creed, who tells me he hears how fine
my horses and coach are, and advises me to avoid being noted for it;
which I was vexed to hear taken notice of, it being what I feared;
1. Used as a cosmetic.

and Povy told me of my gold-lace sleeves in the park yesterday,
which vexed me also, so as to resolve never to appear in Court with
it, but presently to have it taken off, as it is fit] should. And so to my
wife at Unthankes, and coach, and called at my tailor’s to that
purpose; and so home, and after a walk in the garden, home to
supper and to bed.
