Put on my mourning. Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten.
Then to Westminster and at the hall stayed talking with Mrs.
Michell a good while; and in the afternoon, finding myself unfit for
business, I went to the Theatre and saw Breneralt; I never saw
before. It seemed a good play, but ill acted; only, I sat before Mrs.
Palmer, the King’s mistress, and filled my eyes with her, which
much pleased me.
