Up and walked to Deptford, where after doing something at
the yard, I walked, without being observed, with Bagwell home to
his house and there was very kindly used, and the poor people did
get a dinner for me in their fashion — of whichI also eat very well.
After dinner Ifound occasion of sending him abroad; and then alone
avec elle je tentoy 4 faire ce que je voudrais, et contre sa force je le
faisoy, bien que pas 4 mon contentment. By and by, he coming
back again, I took leave and walked home; and then there to dinner,
where Dr. Fayrbrother came to see me, and Luellin; we dined, and I
to the office, leaving them — where we sat all the afternoon, and I
late at the office. To supper and to the office again very late; then
home to bed.
