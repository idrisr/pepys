Up —and begun our discontent again and sorely angered my
wife; who endeed doth live very lonely. But I do perceive that it is
want of work that doth make her and all other people think of ways
of spending their time worse; and this I owe to my building, that
doth not admit of her undertaking anything of work, because the
house hath been and is still so dirty. To my office late. And this
afternoon my wife in her discontent sent mea letter, which] am ina
quandary what to do, whether to read it or not; but I purpose not,
but to burn it before her face, that I may put a stop to more of this
nature. But I must think of some way, either to find her somebody
to keep her company, or to set her to work and by imployment to
take up her thoughts and time. After doing what I had to do, Iwent
home to supper. And there was very sullen to my wife, and so went
to bed and to sleep (though with much ado, my mind being
troubled) without speaking one word to her.
