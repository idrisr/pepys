Up, with my mind disturbed and with my last night’s doubts
275
upon me. For whichI deserve to be beaten, if not really served as I
am fearful of being; especially since, God knows, that I do not find
honesty enough in my own mind but that upon a small temptation I
could be false to her, and therefore ought not to expect more justice
from her
— but God pardon both my sin and my folly herein. To my
office and there setting all the morning; and at noon dined at home.
After dinner comes Pembleton again; and I being out of humour,
would not see him, pretending business; but Lord, with what
Jealousy did I walk up and down my chamber, listening to hear
whether they danced or no or what they did; notwithstanding I
afterwards knew, and did then believe, that Ashwell was with
them. So to my office awhile; and my jealousy still reigning, I went
in and, not out of any pleasure but from that only reason, did go up
to them to practise; and did make an end of La Duchesse, which I
think [I] should withalittle pains do very well. So broke up and saw
him gone.
