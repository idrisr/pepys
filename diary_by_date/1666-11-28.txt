Up, and with Sir W. Penn to Whitehall (setting his Lady and
daughter down by the way at a mercer’s in the Strand, where they
are going to lay out some money); and to Whitehall, where, though
it blows hard and rains hard, yet the Duke of York is gone a-
hunting. We therefore lost our labour, and so back again — and I by
hackney coach to several places to get things ready against dinner,
and then home and did the like there, to my great satisfaction; and at
noon comes my Lord Hinchingbrooke, Sir Tho. Crew, Mr. John
Crew, Mr. Carteret, and Brisband. I had six noble dishes for them,
dressed by a man-cook, and commended, as endeed they deserved,
for exceedingly well done. We eat with great pleasure, and I
enjoyed myself in it with reflections upon the pleasures which I at
best can expect, yet not to exceed this —eating in silver plates, and all
things mighty rich and handsome about me. A great deal of fine
discourse, sitting almost till dark at dinner; and then broke up with
great pleasure, especially to myself, and they away; only, Mr.
Carteret and I to Gresham College, where they meet now weekly
again. And here they had good discourse how this late experiment
of the dog (which is in perfect good health) may be improved to
good uses to men — and other pretty things, and then broke up.
Here was Mr. Henery Howard, that will hereafter be Duke of
Norfolke, who is admitted this day into the Society; and being a
very proud man, and that values himself upon his family, writes his
name, as he doth everywhere: Henery Howard ofNorfolke. Thence
home, and there comes my Lady Pen, Pegg, and Mrs. Turner, and
played at cards and supped with us, and were pretty merry — and
Pegg with me in my closet a good while, and did suffer mea la besar
mucho et tocar ses cosas upon her breast — wherein I had great
pleasure, and so spent the evening; and then broke up, and I to bed,
my mind mightily pleased with this day’s entertainment.
