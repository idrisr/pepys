To Westminster by water with Sir W. Batten and Sir W.
Penn (our servants in another boat) to the Admiralty; and from
thence I went to my Lord’s to fetch him thither. Where we stayed
all the morning about ordering of money for the victuallers and
advising how to get a sum of money to carry on the business of
the Navy. From thence, dined with Mr. Blackburne at his house
with his friends, where we were very well treated and merry.
From thence, W. Ewre and I to the office of Privy Seale, where I
stayed all the afternoon and received about 4ol for yesterday and
today, at which my heart rejoiced for God’s blessing to me, to
give me this advantage by chance — there being of this 40/ about
rol due to me for this day’s work. So great is the present profit of
this office above what it was in the King’s time; there being the
last month about 300 bills, whereas in the last King’s time it was
much to have 40. With my money, home by coach. It being the
first time that I could get home before our gates were shut since I
came to the Navy Office. When I came home, I find my wife not
very well of her old pain in the lip of her chose, which she had
when we were first married.
