Up, and to the office all the morning, where (which he hath not
done a great while) Sir G. Carteret came to advise with us for the
disposing of rooool, which is the first sum the new Lords
Treasurers have provided us; but unless we have more, this will not
enable us to cut off any of the growing charge, which they seem to
give it us for and expect we should discharge several ships quite off
with it. So home and with my father and wife to Sir W. Penn’s to
dinner, which they invited us to out of their respect to my father, as
a stranger; though Iknow them as false as the devil himself, and that
it is only that they think it fit to oblige me; wherein I am a happy
man, that all of my fellow-officers are desirous of my friendship.
Here as merry as in so false a place and where I must dissemble my
hatred, I could be. And after dinner, my father and wife to a play
and I to my office;.and there busy all the afternoon till late at night;
and then my wife and I sang a song or two in the garden, and so
home to supper and to bed.
