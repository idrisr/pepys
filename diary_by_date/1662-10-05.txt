Lords day. Lay long in bed, talking with my wife; and among
other things, fell out about my mayde Sarah, which my wife would
fain put away, when Ithink her as good a servant as ever came into a
house, but it seems my wife would have one that could dress a head
well. But we were friends at last. Ito church; and this day the parson
hath got one to read with a surplice on; Isuppose himself will take it
up hereafter — for a cunning fellow he is as any of his coate. Dined
with my wife; and then to talk again above, chiefly about her
learning to dance, against her going next year into the country;
which I am willing she shall do.
