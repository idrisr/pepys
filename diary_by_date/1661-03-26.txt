Up early to do business in my study. This is my great day,
that three year ago I was cut of the stone — and blessed be God, I do
yet find myself very free from pain again. All this morning I stayed
at home looking after my workmen, to my great content, about my
stairs. And at noon by coach to my father’s, where Mrs. Turner,
The[oph]., Joyce, Mr. Morrice, Mr. Armiger, Mr. Pierce the
surgeon and his wife — my father and mother and myself and my
wife. Very merry at dinner. Among other things, because Mrs.
Turner and her company eate no flesh at all this Lent and I had a
great deal of good flesh, which made their mouths water.
