Lords day. At my chamber all the morning, making up some
accounts to my great content. At noon comes Mr. Sheres, whom I
find a good engenious man, but doth talk a little too much of his
travels. He left my Lord Sandwich well, but in pain to be at home
for want of money, which comes very hardly. Most of the
afternoon talking of Spain and informing him against his return
how things are here. And so spent most of the afternoon, and then
he parted. And then to my chamber busy, till my eyes were almost
blind with writing and reading and Iwas fain to get the boy to come
and write for me. And then to supper, and Pelling come to me at
supper and then to sing a Psalm with him; and so parted and to bed—
after my wife had read something to me (to save my eyes) ina good
book. This night I did even my accounts of the house, which I have
(to my great shame) omitted now above two months or more; and
therefore am content to take my wife’s and maids’ accounts as they
give them, being not able to correct them, which vexes me; but the
fault being my own, contrary to my wife’s frequent desires, |
cannot find fault; but am resolved never to let them come to that
pass again. The truth is, Ihave indulged myself more to pleasure for
these last two months then ever I did in my life before since I came
to be a person concerned in business — and I doubt when I come to
make up my accounts, I shall find it so by the expense.
