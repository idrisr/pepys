Hampton Court. After discourse with Mr. Sheply, we parted and J

preparing business against tomorrow all the afternoon. At night
walked with my wife upon the leads; and so to supper and to bed.
My [wife] having lately a great paine in her eare, for which this
night she begins to take phisique; and I have got cold and so havea
great deal of my old pain.
