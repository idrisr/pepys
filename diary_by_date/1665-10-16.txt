Upon the Exchange, which is very empty, God knows, and
but mean people there. The news for certain, that the Duch are
come with their fleet before Margett, and some men were
endeavouring to come on shore when the post came away — perhaps
to steal some sheep. But Lord, how Colvill talks of the business of
public Revenue like a madman, and yet Idoubt all true; that nobody
minds it, but that the King and Kingdom must speedily be undone—
and rails at my Lord about the Prizes, but I think knows not my
relation to him. Here I endeavoured to satisfy all I could people
about bills of exchange from Tanger; but it is only with good
words, for money I have not, nor can get. God knows what will
become of all the King’s matters ina
little time, for he runs in debt
every day, and nothing to pay them looked after. Thence I walked
to the Tower. But Lord, how empty the streets are, and melan-
choly, so many poor sick people in the streets, full of sores, and so
many sad stories overheard as I walk, everybody talking of this
dead, and that man sick, and so many in this place, and so many in
that. And they tell me that in Westminster there is never a physitian,
and but one apothecary left, all being dead — but that there are great
543
hopes of a great decrease this week: God send it. Much talk there is
of the Chancellors speech, and the King’s, at the Parliaments
meeting, which are very well liked. And that we shall certainly, by
their speeches, fall out with France at this time, together with the
Dutch — which will find us work. Late at the office, entering my
Journall for eight days past, the greatness of my business hindering
me of late to put it down daily; but I have done it now very true and
perticularly, and hereafter will, I hope, be able to fall into my old
wayof doing it daily. So to my lodging, and there had a good pullet
to my supper; and so to bed, it being very cold again, God be
thanked for it.'
