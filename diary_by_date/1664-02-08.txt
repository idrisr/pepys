Up, and by coach called upon Mr. Phillips and after a little talk
with him, away to my Lord Sandwiches; but he being gone abroad,
I stayed a little and talked with W. Howe; and so to Westminster in
term-time. And there met Mr. Pierce, who told me largely how the
King still doth dote upon his women, even beyond all shame. And
that the good Queen will of herself stop before she goes sometimes
into her dressing-room, till she know whether the King be there,
for fear he should be, as she hath sometimes taken him, with Mrs.
Stuart. And that some of the best parts of the Queenes Joynture is,
contrary to faith and against the opinion of my Lord Treasurer and
his Council, bestowed or rented, I know not how, to my Lord
Fitzharding andMrs. Stuart and others of that crew. That the King
doth dote infinitely upon the Duke of Monmouth, apparently as
one that he entends to have succeed him. God knows what will be
the end of it.
