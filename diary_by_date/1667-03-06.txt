Up, and with W. Penn to Whitehall by coach. Here the Duke of
York did acquaint us (and the King did the like also, afterward
coming in) with his resolution of altering the manner of the war this
year; that is, that we shall keep what fleet we have abroad in several
squadrons; so that now all is come out, but we are to keep it as close
as we can, without hindering the work that is to be done in
preparation to this. Great preparations there are to fortify Sheer-
nesse and the yard at Portsmouth, and forces are drawing down to
both those places, and elsewhere by the seaside; so that we have
some fear of an invasion, and the Duke of York himself did declare
his expectation of the enemy’s blocking us up here in the River, and
therefore directed that we should send away all the ships that we
have to fit out hence. Sir W. Penn told me, going with me this
morning to Whitehall, that for certain the Duke of Buckingham is
brought into the Tower, and that he hath had an hour’s private
conference with the King before he was sent thither. To Westmins-
ter hall; there bought some newsbooks and, as everywhere else,
hear everybody complain of the dearness of coals, being at 4! per
chaldron; the weather too being become most bitter cold, the King
saying today that it was the coldest day he ever knew in England.
