Up, and to my chamber to set down my journall for the last
three days; and then to the office — where busy all the morning. At
noon home to dinner and then with my wife abroad; set her down at
the Exchange and I to St. James’s, where find Sir W. Coventry
alone and fell to discourse of retrenchments; and thereon he tells
how he hath already propounded to the Lord’s committee of the
Council how he would have the Treasurer of the Navy a less man,
that might not sit at the Board but be subject to the Board. He
would have two Controllers to do his work, and two Surveyors,
whereof one of each to take it by turns to reside at Portsmouth and
Chatham, by akind of Rotation. He would have but only one Clerk
of the Acts. He doth tell me he hath propounded how the charge of
the Navy in peace shall come within 200000l, by keeping out 24
ships in summer and 10 in winter. And several other perticulars we
went over of retrenchment; and Ifind Imust provide some things to
offer, that I may be found studious to lessen the King’s charge.
