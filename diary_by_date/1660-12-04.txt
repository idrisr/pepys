To Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret’s Chamber, where all the
officers met; and so we went up to the Duke of Yorke and he took
us into his Closet and we did open to him our project of stopping
the growing charge of the fleet, by paying them in hand one moyety
and the other four months hence. This he doth like; and we returned
by his order to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, and there we did draw up
this design in order to be presented to the parliament. From thence I
to my Lord’s and dined with him and told him what we have done
today. I home by water; and with Mr. Hater in my chamber all
alone, he andI did put this morning’s design into words. This day
the parliament voted that the bodies of Oliver, Ireton, Bradshaw,
and [Pride] should be taken up out of their graves in the abby and
drawn to the gallows and there hanged and buried under it. Which
(methinks) doth trouble me, that a man of so great courage as he
was should have that dishonour, though otherwise he might
deserve it enough.
