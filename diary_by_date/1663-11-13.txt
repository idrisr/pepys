To dinner, where I expected Comissioner Pett; and had a
good dinner, but he came not. After dinner came my Perriwigg-
maker and brings me a second perriwigg, made of my own hair;
which comes to 215. and 6d. more then the worth of my own hair —
so that they both come to 4l ts. 6d., which he sayth will serve me
two years — butI fear it. He being gone, Ito my office and put on my
new Shagg purple gown with gold buttons and loop lace —I being a
little fearful of taking cold and of pain coming upon me. Here |
stayed, making an end of
a troublesome letter, but to my advantage
against Sir W. Batten, giving Sir G. Carteret an account ofour late
great contract with Sir W. Warren for masts; wherein Iam sure! did
the King 600l service. After that, about 9 or 10 a-clock, to supper in
my wife’s chamber, and then about 12 to bed.
