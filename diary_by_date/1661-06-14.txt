To Whitehall to my Lord’s. Where I find Mr. Edwd.
Mountagu and his family come to lie during my Lord’s absence. I
sent to my house, by my Lord’s order, his shipp[-model] and
Triangle virginall. So to my father’s and did give him order about
the buying of this cloth to send to my Lord. But
I could not stay
with him myself; for having got a great cold by my playing the
foole in the water yesterday, I was in great pain and so went home
by coach to bed, and went not to the office at all. And by keeping
myself warme, Ibroke wind and so came to some ease. Rise and eat
some supper and so to bed again.
