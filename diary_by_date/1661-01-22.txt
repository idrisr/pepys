Tothe Controller’s house, where I read over his proposalls to
the Lord Admirall for the regulating of the officers of the navy* —in
which he hath taken much pains — only, he doth seem to have too
good an opinion of them himself. From thence in his coach to
Mercer’s Chappell. And so up to the great hall, where we met with
the King’s Councell for trade upon some proposalls of theirs for
settling convoys for the whole English trade—and that by having 33
ships (4 fourth-rates, 19 fifth, 10 sixth) settled by the King for that
purpose — which endeed was argued very finely by many persons of
Honour and merchants that were there. It pleased me much now to
come in this condition to this place, where I was once a peticioner
for my exhibicion in Pauls school. And also where Sir G. Downing
(my late master) was chaireman, and so but equally concerned with
me. From thence home; and after a little dinner by coach to
Whitehall, and I met with Dr. Tho. Fuller and took him to the
Dogg, where he tells me of his last and great book that is coming
out: that is, his history of all the families of England — and could tell
me more of my owne then I knew myself. And also to what
perfection he hath now brought the art of memory; that he did
lately to four eminently great Schollars dictate together in Latin
upon different Subjects of their proposing, faster then they were
able to write, till they were tired. And by the way, in discourse tells
me that the best way of beginning a sentence, ifa man should be out
and forget his last sentence (which he never was), that then his last
refuge is to begin with an Utcunque.
