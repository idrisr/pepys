Up and to the office, where all the morning. And at noon
comes Knepp and Mrs. Pierce and her daughter, and one Mrs.
Foster, and dined with me — and mighty merry; and after dinner
carried them to the Tower and showed them all to be seen there; and
among other things, the Crown and Scepters and rich plate, which I
myself never saw before and endeed is noble — and I mightily
pleased with it. Thence by water to the Temple, and there to the
Cocke alehouse and drank and eat a lobster and sang, and mighty
merry. So, almost night, I carried Mrs. Pierce home, and then
Knipp and I to the Temple again and took boat, it being darkish,
and to Foxhall, it being now night and a bonfire burning at
Lambeth for the King’s Coronacion day. And there she and I drank;
and yo did tocar her corps all over and besar sans fin her, but did not
offer algo mas; and so back and led her home, it being now Io at
night, and so got a link; and walking towards home, just at my
entrance into the ruines at St. Dunstan’s, I was met by two rogues
with clubs, who came towards us; so] went back and walked home
quite round by the Wall and got well home; and to bed, weary but
pleased at my day’s pleasure — but yet displeased at my expense and
timeIlose.
