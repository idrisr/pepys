Lords day. Up, and at my chamber all the morning, setting
papers to rights with my boy. And so to dinner at noon, the girl
with us; but my wife troubled thereat to see her, and doth tell me so;
which troubles me, for I love the girl. At my chamber again to
work all the afternoon till night, when Pelling comes, who
wonders to find my wife so dull and melancholy; but God knows,
she hath too much cause. However, as pleasant as we can, we
supped together; and so made the boy read to me, the poor girl not
appearing at supper, but hides herself in her chamber — so that I
could wish in that respect that she was out of the house, for our
peace is broke to all of us while she is here. And so to bed — where
my wife mighty unquiet all night, so as my bed is become
burdensome to me.
