Up and to my office, whither by agreement Mr. Coventry
came before the time of setting to confer about preparing an
account of the extraordinary charge of the Navy since the King’s
coming. So by and by we sat, and so till noon. Then home to
dinner; and in the afternoon some ofus met again upon something
relating to the Victualling; and thence to my writing of letters late,
and making my Alphabet to my new Navy-booke, very pretty.
And so after writing to my father by the post about the endeavour
to come to a composition with my uncle, though a very bad one,
desiring him to be contented therewith—I went home to supper and
bed.
