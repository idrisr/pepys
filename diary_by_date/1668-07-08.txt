Betimes by water to Sir W. Coventry and there discoursed of
several things; and I find him much concerned in the present
enquiries now on foot of the Commissioners of Accounts, though
he reckons himself and the rest very safe; but vexed to see us liable to
these troubles in things wherein we have laboured to do best.
Thence, he being to go out of town tomorrow to drink Banbury
waters — I to the Duke of York to attend him about business of the
Office; and find him mighty free to me, and how he is concerned to
mend things in the Navy himself, and not leave it to other people.
So home to dinner; and then with my wife to Coopers and there saw
her sit; and he doth do extraordinary things endeed. So to Whitehall;
and there by and by the Duke of York comes to the Robe Chamber
and spent with us three hours till night, in hearing the business of the
Maisters-Attendants of Chatham and the Store-keeper of Wool-
wich; and resolves to displace them all, so hot he is of giving proofs
of his justice at this time-—that it is their great fate now, to come to be
questioned at such a time as this. Thence I to Unthankes and took
my wife and Deb home — and to supper and bed.
