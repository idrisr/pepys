Up betimes, and to my office about business (Sir W. Coventry
having sent me word that he is gone down to the fleet to see how
matters stand, and to be back again speedily), and with the same
expectation of congratulating ourselfs with the victory that I had
yesterday. But my Lord Brouncker and Sir T. Harvey, that came
from Court, tell me quite contrary news, which astonishes me.
That is to say, that we are beaten — lost many ships and good
commanders — have not taken one ship of the enemy’s, and so can
only report ourselfs a victory; nor is it certain that we were left
maisters of the field. But above all, that the Prince run on shore upon
the Galoper, and there stuck — was endeavoured to be fetched off by
the Duch but could not, and so they burned her—and Sir G. Ascue is
taken prisoner and carried into Holland. This news doth much
trouble me, and the thoughts of the ill consequences of it, and the
628
pride and presumption that brought us to it. I do find great reason
to think we are beaten in every respect, and that we are the losers.
The Prince upon the Galloper, where both the Royall Charles and
Royall Katharine, had come twice aground, but got off. The Essex
carried into Holland. The Swiftsure misseing (Sir Wm. Barkely)
ever since the beginning of the fight. Captains Bacon, Tearne,
Wood, Mootham, Whitty, and Coppin Slayne. The Duke of
Albemarle writes that he never fought with worse officers in his
life, not above 20 of them behaving themselfs like men. Sir Wm.
Clerke lost his leg, and in two days died. The Loyall George, Seven
Oakes, and Swiftsure are still missing, having never, as the Generall
writes himself, engaged with them.
