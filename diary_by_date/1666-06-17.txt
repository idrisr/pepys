Lords day. My father and I walked to Grayse Inn fields and
there spent an hour or two, walking and talking of several
businesses. First, as to his estate, he told me it produced about 80l
per annum. But then there goes 30] per annum taxes and other
things, certain charge — which I do promise to make good, as far as
this 30! — at which the poor man was overjoyed and wept. As to
Pall, he tells me he is mightily satisfied with Ensum; and so |
promised to give her soo presently, and to oblige myself to rool
more on the birth of her first child, he insuring her in 1ol per annum
for every rool. And in the meantime, till she doth marry, I promise
to allow her tol per annum. Then as to John, I tell him I will
promise him nothing, but wiil supply him as so much lent him — I
declaring that I am not pleased with him yet. And that when his
degree is over, I will send for him up hither, and if he be good for
632
anything, doubt not to get him preferment. This discourse ended to
the joy of my father, and no less to me, to see that Iam able to do
this; we return to Joyces and there, wanting a coach to carry us
home, I walked out as far as the New Exchange to find one, but
could not. So down to the Milke-house and drank three glasses of
whey, and then up into the Strand again, and there met with a
coach. And so to Joyces and took up my father, wife, sister, and
Mercer, and to Islington, where we drank, and then our Tour by
Hackny home - where, after a little business at my office and then
talk with my Lady and Pegg Pen in the garden, Ihome and to bed —
being very weary.
