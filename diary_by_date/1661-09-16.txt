Inthe afternoon, by appointment to meet Dr. Williams and
his atturny, and they and I to Tom. Trice. Here we were at high
1. Gondolas; a gift from the Doge and Senate of Venice.
153
words — and then parted; and we to Standings in Fleetstreete, where
we sat and drunk and talked a great while — about my going down
to Gravely Court,! which will be this week. At night I went home
and there find letters from my father informing me of the Court,
and that I must come down and meet him at Impington — which I
presently resolved to do. And the next morning got up, telling my
wife of my journy; and she with a few words got me to hire her a
horse to go along with me.
