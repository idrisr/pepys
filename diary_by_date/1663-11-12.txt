To [my Lord’s] lodgings. Anon my Lord doth come in and I
begun to fall in discourse with him; but my heart did misgive me
that my Lord would not take it well, and then found him not in a
humour to talk; and so after a few ordinary words, my Lord not
talking in that manner as he uses to do, I took leave and spent some
time with W. Howe; and told him how I could not do what I had so
great a mind and resolution to do, but that I thought it would be as
well to do it in writing; which he approves of, and so I took leave of
him and by coach home, my mind being full of it and in pain
concerning it. So to my office, busy very late, the nights running on
faster then one thinks. And so home to supper and to bed.
