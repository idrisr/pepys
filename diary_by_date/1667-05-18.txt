Upandall morning at the office, and then to dinner; and after
dinner to the office to dictate some letters, and then with my wife
down to Sir W. Turner’s to visit The[oph].; but she being abroad,
we back again home; and thenI to the office, finished my letters,
and then to walk an hour in the garden talking with my wife, whose
growth in music doth begin to please me mightily; and by and by
home and there find our Luce drunk, and when her mistress told her
of it, would be gone; and so put up some of her things and did go
away of her accord, nobody pressing her to it; and the truth is,
though she be the dirtiest and homeliest servant that ever Ikept, yet
I was sorry to have her go, partly through my love to my servants
and partly because she was a very drudging, working wench; only,
she would be drunk.
