Atnoon, I to the Change and there hear by Mr. Hublon that
letters are come that the Dutch have stopped the fitting of their
great ships and the coming outof a fleet of theirs of 50 sail that was
ready to come out; but I doubt the truth ofit yet. Thence to Sir G.
Carteret by his invitation to his office, where my Lady was, and
dined with him and very merry, and good people they are when
pleased as any I know. After dinner, I to Whitehall, thinking there
to have seen the Duchesse of Newcastle’s coming this night to
Court to make a visit to the Queen, the King having been with her
yesterday to make hera visit since her coming to town. The whole
story of this Lady is a romance, and all she doth is romantic. Her
footmen in velvet coats, and herself in an antique* dress, as they say;
and was the other day at her own play, The Humourous Lovers; the
most ridiculous thing that ever was wrote, but yet she and her Lord
mightily pleased with it, and she at the end made her respect to the
players from her box and did give them thanks. There is as much
expectation of her coming to Court, that so [many] people may
come to see her, asif it were the Queen of Sweden. But I lost my
labour, for she did not come this night.
