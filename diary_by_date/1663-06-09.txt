Wemetat the office, Mr. Coventry, SirJ. Mennes and I; and so
in the evening, business done, I went home. Spent my time till
night with my wife. Presently after my coming home comes
Pembleton, whether by appointment or no I know not, or whether
by a former promise that he would come once before my wife’s
going into the country. But I took no notice, but let them go up and
Ashwell with them to dance; which they did, and I stayed below in
my chamber; but Lord, how I listened and laid my eare to the door,
and how I was troubled when Iheard them stand still and not dance.
Anon they made an end and had done, and so I suffered him to go
away and spoke not to him, though troubled in my mind; but
showed no discontent to my wife, believing that this is the last time
Ishall be troubled with him. So my wife andI to walk in the garden,
and so home and to supper and to bed.
