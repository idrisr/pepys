We met at the office this morning about some perticular
business. And then I to Whitehall and there dined with my Lord;
and after dinner Mr. Creed andI to Whitefriers, where we saw The
Bondman acted most excellently; and though Ihave seen it often, yet
I am every time more and more pleased with Batterton’s action.
