Athomeall day. There dined with me Sir Wm. Batten and his
Lady and daughter — Sir W. Pen — Mr. Fox (his lady being ill could
not come) and Capt. Cuttance. The first dinner I have made since I
came hither: This cost me above s/. And merry we were- only, my
chimny smokes. The company all go away. And by and by Sir
Wms both, and my Lady Batten and his daughter came again and
supped with me and talked till late; and so to bed, being glad that
that trouble is over.
