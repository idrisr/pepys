Lords day. Up, and at my chamber all the morning and the
office, doing business and also readingalittle of L’escolle des Filles,
which is a mighty lewd book, but yet not amiss for a sober man
once to read over to inform himself in the villainy of the world. At
noon home to dinner, where by appointment Mr. Pelling came,
and with him three friends: Wallington that sings the good bass,
and one Rogers, and a gentleman, a young man, his name Tempest,
who sings very well endeed and understands anything in the world
at first sight. After dinner, we into our dining-room and there to
singing all the afternoon (by the way, I must remember that Pegg
Pen was brought to bed yesterday ofa girl; and among other things,
if I have not already set it down, that hardly ever was remembered
such a season for the smallpox as these last two months have been,
people being seen all up and down the streets, newly come out after
the smallpox): but though they sang fine things, yet I must confess
that I did take no pleasure in it, or very little, because I understood
not the words; and with the rests that the words are set, there is no
sense nor understanding in them, though they be English — which
makes us weary of singing in that manner, it being but a worse sort
of instrumental music. We sang till almost night, and drank my
good store of wine; and then they parted and I to my chamber,
where I did read through L’escholle des Filles; and after Ihad doneit, I
burned it, that it might not be among my books to my shame; and
so at night to supper and then to bed.
