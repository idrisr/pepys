All the morning almost at home, seeing my stairs finished by
the painter, which please me well. So with Mr. Moore to West-
minster hall, it being terme, and then by water to the Wardrobe
— where very merry. So home to the office all the afternoon. Thanks
be to God, I am very well again of my late payne. And tomorrow
hope to be out of my pain of dirt and trouble in my house, of which
I am now become very weary. One thing I must observe here,
while I think of it; that 1am now become the most negligent man in
the world as to matter of newes. Insomuch, that nowadays I neither
can tell any nor aske any of others.
