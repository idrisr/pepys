Sunday. Up, and was trimmed, and sent my brother to
Woolwich to my wife to dine with her. I to church, where our
parson made a melancholy but good sermon —and many, and most,
in the church cried, especially the women. The church mighty full,
but few of fashion, and most strangers. I walked to Bednall green;
and there dined well, but a bad venison pasty, at Sir W. Rider’s.
Good people they are, and good discourse. And his daughter
Middleton, a fine woman and discreet. Thence home, and to
church again, and there preached Deane Harding; but methinks a
bad poor sermon, though proper for the time — nor eloquent, in
saying at this time that the City is reduced froma large Folio to a
Decimo tertio. So to my office, there to write down my journall
and take leave of my brother, whom I sent back this afternoon,
though rainy — which it hath not done a good while before. But I
had no room nor convenience for him here till my house is fitted;
but I was very kind to him, and do take very well of him his
journey. I did give him 4os. for his pocket; and so he being gone,
and it presently rayning, I was troubled for him, though it is good
for the Fyre. Anon to Sir W. Penn to bed, and made my boy Tom to
read me asleep.
