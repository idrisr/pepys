Lay in bed, being Lords day, all the morning talking with my
469
wife, sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased; and then up and to
dinner. All the afternoon also at home and Sir W. Batten’s, and in
the evening comes Mr. Andrews and we sung together; and then to
supper (he not staying) and at supper, hearing by accident of my
mayds their letting in a rogueing Scotch woman that haunts the
office, to help them to wash and scour in our house, and that very
lately, I fell mightily out, and made my wife, to the disturbance of
the house and neighbours, to beat our little girle; and then we shut
her down into the cellar and there she lay all night. So we to bed.
