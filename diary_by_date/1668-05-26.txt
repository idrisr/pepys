Up by 4 a-clock; and by the time we were ready and had eat,
we were called to the coach; where about 6 a-clock we set out, there
being a man and two women of one company, ordinary people, and
one lady alone that is tolerable handsome, but mighty well spoken,
whom I took great pleasure in talking to, and did get her to read
aloud in a book she was reading in the coach, being the King’s
Meditations; and then the boy and Ito sing, and so about noon came
to Bishop’s Stafford, to another house then what we were at the
other day, and better used; and here I paid for the reckoning 11s.,
we dining all together and pretty merry. And then set out again,
sleeping most part of the way, and got to Bishopsgate street before
8 a-clock, the waters being now most of them down, and we
avoiding the bad way in the Forrest by a privy way which brought
us to Hodsden, and so to Tibalds that road — which was mighty
pleasant. So home, where we find all well, and Brother Balty and
his wife looking to the house, she mighty fine in a new gold-laced
juste-au-corps. I shifted myself, and so to see Mrs. Turner; and
Mercer appearing over the way, called her in and sat and talked; and
then home to my house by and by and there supped and talked
mighty merry; and then broke up and to bed — beinga little vexed at
what W. Hewers tells me Sir Jo. Shaw did this day in my absence
say at the Board, complaining of my doing of him injury and the
board permitting it; whereas they had more reason to except against
his attributing that to me alone which I could not do but with their
consent and direction, it being to very good service to the King, and
whatI shall be proud [to] have imputed to me alone. The King, I
hear, came to town last night.
