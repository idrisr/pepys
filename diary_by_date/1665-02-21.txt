Up, and to the office (having a mighty pain in my forefinger
of my left hand, fromastrain that it received last night in struggling
avec la femme que je mentioned yesterday), where busy till noon;
and then, my wife being busy in going with her woman to a hot-
house to bath herself, after her long being within doors in the dirt,
so that she now pretends to a resolution of being hereafter very
clean — how long it will hold, I can guess — I dined with Sir W.
Batten and my Lady, they being nowadays very fond of me. So to
the Change, and off of the Change with Mr. Wayth to a cook’s shop
and there dined again, for discourse with him about Hamaccos and
the abuse now practised in tickets, and more like every day to be —
also, of the great profit Mr. Fen makes of his place — he being
(though he demands but3 per cent of all he pays, and that is easily
computed) but very little pleased with any man that gives him no
more. So to the office; and after office my Lord Brunkerd carried
me to Lincoln’s Inn fields, and there I with my Lady Sandwich
(good lady), talking of innocent discourse of good housewifery and
husbands for her daughters, and the luxury and looseness of the
times and other such things, till past 10 a-clock at night; and so by
coach home, wherealittle at my office, and so to supper and to bed.
My Lady tells me what mad freaks the mayds of Honour at Court
have — that Mrs. Jennings, one of the Duchess’s maids, the other
day dressed herself like an orange-wench and went up and down
and cried oranges — till falling down, or by such accident (though in
the evening), her fine shoes were discerned and she put to a great
deal of shame.
