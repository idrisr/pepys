earely, Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Wms and I by Coach to
Deptford, it being very windy and rainy weather — taking a Codd
and some prawnes in Fishstreete with us. We settled to pay the
Guernsy —a small ship, but came to a great deal of money, it having
been unpaid ever since before the King came in — by which means,
not only the King pays wages while the ship hath lain still, but the
poor men have most of them been forced to borrow all the money
due for their wages before they receive it, and that at a dear rate,
God knows. So that many of them had very little to receive at the
table — which grieved me to see it.
