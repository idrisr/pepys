Lords day. Up, and put on my new Scallop, and is very fine.
To church and there saw, the first time, Mr. Mills in a Surplice; but
it seemed absurd for him to pull it over his eares in the reading-pew
229
after he had done before all the church, to go up to the pulpitt to
preach without it. Home and dined; and Mr. Sympson, my Joyner
that doth my dining-room, and my brother Tom with me to a
delicate fat pig. Then to church again and heard a simple Scott
preach most tediously. So home and then to see Sir W. Batten, who
is pretty well again; and then to my uncle Wights to show my fine
band and to see Mrs. Margtt Wight, but she was not there. All this
day, soldiers going up and down the towne, there being an alarme
and many Quakers and others clapped up; but Ibelieve without any
reason. Only, they say in Dorsettshire there hath been some rising
discovered. So after supper home and then to my study; and
making up my monthly account to myself, I find myself, by my
expense in bands and clothes this month, abatedalittle of my last,
and that I am worth 679] still; for which God be praised. So home
and to bed, with quiet mind, blessed be God, but afeared of my
candle’s going out, which makes me write thus slubberingly.
