This morning to the office, full of resolution to spend the
whole day at business. And there, among other things, I did agree
with Poynter to be my clerk for my Victualling business. And so I
all alone all the day long, shut up in my little closet at my office,
drawing up instructions which I should long since have done for
my Surveyors of the Ports —Sir W. Coventry desiring much to have
them, and he might well have expected them long since. After
dinner to it again; and at night had long discourse with Gibbson,
who is for Yarmouth, who makes me understand so much of the
victualling business and the pursers trade, that lam shamed Ishould
go about the concerning myself in a business which Iunderstand so
very very little of, and made me distrust all I had been doing today.
So I did lay it by till tomorrow morning, to thinkofit fresh. And so
home, by promise to my wife to have mirth there; so we have our
neighbours, little Mis Tooker and Mrs. Daniels, to dance; and after
supper I to bed and left them merry below, which they did not part
from till 2 or 3 in the morning.
