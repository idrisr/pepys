With Sir W. Batten by water to Whitehall, and he to
Westminster. I went to see Sarah and my Lord’s Lodgeings, which
are now all in dirt, to be repaired against my Lord’s coming from
sea with the Queene. Thence to Westminster hall and there walked
up and down and heard the great difference that hath been between
my Lord Chancellor and my Lord of Bristoll, about a proviso that
my Lord Chancellor would have brought into the bill for
Conformity, that it shall be in the power of the King, when he sees
fit, to dispence with the act of Conformity. And though it be
carried in the House of Lords, yet it is believed it will hardly pass in
the Commons.
