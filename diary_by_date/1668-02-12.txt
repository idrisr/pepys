Up and to my office, where all the morning drawing up my
Narrative of my proceedings and concernments in the buying of
Prize goods, which Iam to present to the Committee for Accounts.
At noon home to dinner, where Mr. Jackson dined with me; and
after dinnerI (calling at the Excise Office, and setting my wife and
Deb at her tailor’s) did with Mr. Jackson go to find my Cosen Rog.
Pepys, whichI did in the Parliament-house, where I met him and
Sir Tho. Crew and Mr. George Mountagu, who are mighty busy
how to save my Lord’s name from being in the report for anything
which the Committee is commanded to report to the House of the
Miscarriages of the late war. I find they drive furiously still in the
business of Tickets, which is nonsense in itself and cannot come to
anything. Thence with Cosen Rogr. to his lodgings and there
sealed the writings with Jackson about my sister’s marriage.
