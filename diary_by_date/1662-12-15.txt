To my Lord’s and there with Mr. Creed, Moore and Howe to
the Crowne and dined; and thence to Whitehall, where I walked up
and down the Gallerys, spending my time upon the pictures till the
Duke and the Comittee for Tanger met (the Duke not staying with
us); where the only matter was to discourse with my Lord
Rutherford, who is this day made Governor of Tanger for I know
not what reasons, and my Lord of Peterbrough to be called home;
which though it is said is done with kindness, yet all the world may
see it is done otherwise; and Iam sorry to see a Catholicke Governor
sent to command there, where all the rest of the officers almost are
such already. But God knows what the reason is, and all may see
how slippery places all Courtiers stand in. Thence by coach home,
and so driving through the backside of the Shambles in Newgate
Market, my coach plucked down two pieces of beef into the Dirt,
upon which the butchers stopped the horses, and a great rout of
241
people in the street — crying that he had done him 4os. and $/ worth
of hurt; but going down, I saw that he had done little or none; and
so I gave them a Shilling for it and they were well contented, and so
home. And there to my Lady Batten to see her, who tells me she
hath just now a letter from Sir Wm., how that he and Sir
J.Mennes
did very narrowly escape drowning on the roade, the waters are so
high, but is well. But Lord, what a Hypocrite-like face she made to
tell it me.
