Up betimes and to my office all the morning with Capt.
Cocke, ending their account of their Riga Contract for Hemp. So
home to dinner, my head full of business against the office. After
dinner comes my uncle Thomas witha
letter to my father, wherein,
as we desire, he and his son do order their Tenants to pay their rents
to us; which pleases me well. In discourse he tells me my uncle
Wight thinks much that I do never see them, and they have reason;
but I do apprehend their hav[ing] been too far concerned with my
uncle Tho. against us, so that I have had no mind hitherto; but now
I will go see them. He being gone, I to the office; where at the choice
of Maisters and Chyrurgeons for the fleet now going out, I did my
business as I couid wish, both for the persons I have a mind to serve
and in getting the warrants signed drawn by my clerks, which Iwas
afeared of. Sat late; and having done, I went home; where I find
Mary Ashwell come to live with us, of whom I hope well and pray
God she may please us — which though it cost me something, yet
will give me much content. So to supper and to bed. And find by
her discourse and carriage tonight, that she is not proud but will do
what she is bid; but for want of being abroad, knows not how to
give that respect to her mistress as she will do when she is told it —
she having been used only to little children, and there was a kind ofa
262
mistress over them. Troubled all night with my cold, I being quite
hoarse with it, that I could not speak to be heard at all almost.
