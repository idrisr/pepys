Up and betimes to my office and then out to several places.
Among others, to Holborne to have spoke with one Mr. Under-
wood about some English Hemp -— he lies against grays Inn.
Thereabouts, Ito a barbers shop to have my hair cut. And there met
with a copy of verses, mightily commended by some gentleman
there, of my Lord Mordants in excuse of his going to sea — this late
expedition, with the Duke of York. But Lord, they are but sorry
things; only, a Lord made them. Thence to the Change; and there
among the merchants, I hear fully the news of our being beaten to
dirt at Guiny by De Ruyter with his fleet.
