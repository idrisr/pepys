Up, it being Shrove Tuseday, and at the office sat all the
morning. At noon to the Change and there met with Sir W. Rider;
and of a sudden, knowing what I had at home, brought him and
Mr. Cutler and Mr. Cooke, clerk to Mr. Secretary Morrice, a sober
and learned man and one I knew heretofore when he was my Lord
{Lockhart’s] secretary at Dunkirke. I made much of them and had a
pretty dinner for a sudden; we talked very pleasantly, and they
many good discourses of their travels abroad. After dinner, they
gone and Ito my office, where doing many businesses very late; but
to my good content, to see how I grow in estimation every day
more and more, and have things given more oftener then I used to
have formerly; as, to have a case of very pretty knifes with agate
hafts by Mrs. Russell. So home and to bed. This day, by the
blessing of God, I have lived 31 years in the world; and by the grace
of God I find myself not only in good health in everything, and
perticularly [as] to the stone, but only pain upon taking cold; and
also in a fair way of coming to a better esteem and estate in the
world then ever I expected; but I pray God give mea heart to fear a
fall and to prepare for it.
