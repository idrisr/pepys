Up and to my office a little, and then to Browns for my
Measuring Rule, which is made, and is certainly the best and the
most commodious for carrying in one’s pocket and most useful that
ever was made, and myself have the honour of being as it were the
inventor of this form of it. After dinner I walked to Deptford and
there found Sir W. Penn; and I
fell to measuring of some plank that
was serving into the yard; which the people took notice of and the
measurer himself was amuzed* at, for Idid it much more ready then
he. And I believe Sir W. Penn would be glad I could have done less,
or he more. By and by he went away, and I stayed walking up and
down, discoursing with the officers of the yard of several things;
and so walked back again, and on my way young Bagwell and his
wife waylayd me to desire my favour about getting him a better
ship; which I shall pretend to be willing to do for them, but my
mind is to know his wife alittle better. So home; and my brother
John and Iup, and I to my Musique and then to discourse with him;
andI find him not so thorough a philosopher, at least in Aristotle, as
I took him for, he not being able to tell me the definicion of fire nor
which of the four Qualitys belonged to each of the four elements.
So to prayers and to bed. Among other things, being much
satisfyed in my new Rule.
