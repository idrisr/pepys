Up, and called up by the King’s Trumpets, which cost me Ios.
So to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon, by
invitation, my wife (who had not been there these ten months I
think) and I to meet, all our families, at Sir W. Batten’s at dinner;
where neither a great dinner for so much company, nor anything
good or handsome. In middle of dinner I rose, and my wife, and by
coach to the King’s playhouse; and meeting Creed, took him up,
and there saw The Scornfull Lady well acted, Doll Common doing
Abigail most excellently, and Knipp the Widow very well (and will
be an excellent actor I think); in other parts, the play not so well
done as used to be by the old actors. Anon to Whitehall by coach,
thinking to have seen a play there tonight — but found it a mistake;
so back again, and missed our coach, who was gone, thinking to
come time enough three hours hence; and we could not blame him.
So forced to get another coach, and all three home to my house; and
there to Sir W. Batten’s to eat a bit of cold chine of beef, and then
stayed and talked; and then home, and sat and talkeda little by the
fire’s side with wife and Creed; and so to bed, my left eye being very
sore. No business, public nor private, minded all these two days.
