Up betimes and among my workmen, and with great
pleasure see the posts in my entry taken down, beyond expectation,
so that now, the boy’s room being laid into the entry doth make my
coming in very handsome, which was the only fault remaining
225
almost in my house. We sat all the morning. And in the afternoon |
got many jobbs done to my mind, and my wife’s chamber put into a
good readiness against her coming — which she did at night, for Will
did, by my leave to go, meet her upon the road and at night did
bring me word she was come to my brother’s by my order. So I
made myself ready and put things at home in order, and so went
thither to her. Being come, I find her and her maid and dog very
well —and herself grownalittle fatter then she was. I was very well
pleased to see her; and after supper, to bed and had her company
with great content — and much mutual love. Only, I do perceive
that there hath been fallings-out between my mother and she, and a
little between my father and she; but I hope all is well again. And I
perceive she likes Brampton house and seat better then ever I did
myself. And tells me how my Lord hath drawn a plot of some
alterations to be made there, and hath brought it up, which I saw
and like well. I perceive my Lord and Lady have been very kind to
her. And Capt. Ferrers, so kind that I perceive [I] have some
jealousy of him; but I know what is the Captain’s manner of
carriage, and therefore it is nothing to me.
