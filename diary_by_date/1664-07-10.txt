Lords day. Up, and by water towards noon to Somersett
house; and walked to my Lord Sandwiches and there dined with my
Lady and the children. And after some ordinary discourse with my
Lady, after dinner took our leaves and [my] wife hers, in order to
her going to the country tomorrow. Here my Lady showed us my
Lady Castlemaynes picture, finely done — given my Lord, and a
most beautiful picture it is. Thence with my Lady Jem and Mr.
Sidny to St. Gyles church, and there heard a long poor sermon.
Thence set them down and in their coach to Kate Joyces christening
— where much company — good service of sweetmeats. And after an
hour’s stay left them and in my Lord’s coach, his noble rich coach,
home; and there my wife fell to putting things in order against her
going tomorrow. And I to read and so to bed — where I not well,
and so had no pleasure at all this night with my poor wife.
