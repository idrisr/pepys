At the office all the morning, Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Penn and
I, about the Victuallers accounts. Then home to dinner, and to the
office again all the afternoon, Mr. Hater and I writing over my
Alphabet faire, in which Itook great pleasure to rule the lines and to
have the Capitall words writ with red inke.
