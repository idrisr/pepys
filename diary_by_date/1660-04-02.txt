Up very early, and to get all my things and my boy’s packed
up. Great concourse of commanders here this morning to take leave
of my Lord upon his going into the Naseby, so that the table was
full; so there dined below many commanders and Mr. Creed, who
was much troubled to hear that he could not go along with my
Lord, for he had already got all his things thither, thinking to stay
there. After dinner I went in one of the boats with my boy before
my Lord, and made shift before night to get my cabin in pretty
good order. It is but little; but very convenient, having one window
to the sea and another to the Deck — and a good bed.
