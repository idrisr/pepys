To Whitehall — where I find my Lord gone abroad to the
Wardrobe, whither he doth now go every other morning, and doth
seem to resolve to understand and look after that business himself.
From thence to Westminster hall; and in King streete, there being a
great stop of coaches, there was a falling-out between a drayman
and my Lord Chesterfield’s coachman, and one of his footmen
killed. At the Hall I met with Mr. Creed; and he and I to Hell! to
drink our morning draught. And so I to my Lord’s again, where I
find my wife. And she and Idined with him and my Lady and great
company of my Lord’s friends, and my Lord did show us great
respect.
