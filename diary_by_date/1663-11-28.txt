Up and at the office; sat all the morning and at noon by Mr.
Coventrys coach to the Change; and after a little while there, where
I met with Mr. Pierce the surgeon, who tells me for good news that
my Lord Sandwich is resolved to go no more to Chelsy, and told
me he believed that Ihad been giving my Lord some counsel, which
Ineither denied nor affirmed but seemed glad with him that he went
thither no more. And so I home to dinner, and thence abroad to
Pauls churchyard and there looked upon the second part of
Hudibras; which I buy not but borrow to read, to seeif it be as good
as the first, which the world cries so mightily up; though it hath not
a good liking in me, though I had tried by twice or three times
reading to bring myself to think it witty. Back again home; and to
my office and there late doing businesses, and so home to supper
and to bed. I have been told it two or three times, but today for
certain I am told how in Holland publicly they have pictured our
King with reproach. One way is with his pockets turned the wrong
side outward, hanging out empty — another, with two courtiers
picking of his pocket — anda third, leading of two ladies, while
others abuse him — which amounts to great contempt.
