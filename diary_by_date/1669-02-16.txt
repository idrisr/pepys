Up and to the office, where all the morning, my head full of
business of the office now at once on my hand; and so at noon home
to dinner, where I find some things of W. Batelier’s come out of
France; among which, some clothes for my wife, wherein she is
likely to lead me to the expense of so much money as vexed me; but

Nantueil’s, bigger then the other which he brought over, that

this day sennit, and I think without hurting my eyes any more then
they were before; which was very much. And so home to supper
and to bed.
