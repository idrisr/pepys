Lords day. Up, and being trimmed, I was invited by Capt.
1. The ‘Additional Aid’ of 1665.
569
Cocke; so I left my wife, having a mind to some discourse with
him, and dined with him. He tells me of new difficulties about his
goods, which troubles me andI fear they will be great. He tells me
too, what I hear everywhere, how the town talks of my Lord
Craven being to come into Sir G. Carteret’s place; but sure it cannot
be true. But I do fear those two families, his and my Lord
Sandwiches, are quite broken—and I must now stand upon my own
legs. Thence to my lodging; and considering how Iam hindered by
company there to do anything among my papers, Idid resolve to go
away today, rather then stay to no purpose till tomorrow; and so
got all my things packed up — and spent half an hour with W. How
about his papers of accounts for contingencies and my Lord’s
accounts, and so took leave of my landlady and daughters, having
paid dear for what time I have spent there; but yet, having been
quiet and in health, Iam very well contented therewith. So with my
wife and Mercer took boat, and away home. But in the evening,
before Iwent, comes Mrs. Knipp just to speak with me privately, to
excuse her not coming to me yesterday, complaining how like a
devil her husband treats her, but will be with us in town a week
hence; and so I kissed her and parted. Being come home, my wife
and I to look over our house, and consider laying out a little money
to hang our bedchamber better then it is; and so resolved to go and
buy something tomorrow; and so after supper, with great joy in my
heart for my coming once again hither, to bed.
