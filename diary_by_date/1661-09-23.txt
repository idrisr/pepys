We took horse and got early to Baldwick; where there was a
fair, and we put in and eat a mouthful of porke, which they made us
pay 14d. for, which vexed us much. And so away to Stevenage and
stayed till a showre was over; and so rode easily to Welling — where
we supped well and had two beds in the room and so lay single; and
must remember it that, of all the nights that ever I slept in my life, I
never did pass a night with more epicurisme of sleep — there being
155
now and then a noise of people stirring that waked me; and then it
was a very rainy night; and then I was a little weary, that what
between waking and then sleeping again, one after another, I never
had so much content in all my life. And so my wife says it was with
her.
