Up and to the office, where sat all the morning. Among other
things, a great conflict Ihad with Sir W. Warren, he bringinga
letter
to the Board, flatly in words charging them with their delays in
passing his accounts, which have been with them these two years —
part of which I said was not true, and the other undecent. The
whole Board was concerned to take notice of it, as well as myself,
but none of them had the honour to do it, but suffered me to do it
alone; only Sir W. Batten, which did what he did out of common
spite to him. So I writ in the margin of the letter, “Returned as
untrue,”’ and by consent of the Board did give it him again — and so
parted. After dinner, to the office again and there late all the
afternoon, doing much business; and with great content, home and
to supper and to bed.
