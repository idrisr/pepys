Tomy Lord Sandwich by water and told him how well things
did go in the country with me,' of which he was very glad, and
seems to concern himself much for me. Thence with Mr. Creede to
Westminster hall, and by and by thither comes Capt. Ferrer, upon
my sending for him; and we three to Creedes chamber and there sat
a good while and drank Chocolate. Here Iam told how things go at
Court; that the young men get uppermost, and the old serious lords
are out of favour. That Sir H. Bennet being brought into Sir Edwd.
Nicholas place, Sir Ch. Barkely is made Privy purse — a most
vicious person, and one whom Mr. Pierce the surgeon today (at
which Ilaugh to myself) did tell me that he offered his wife 300l per
annum to be his whore. He also told me that none in Court hath
more the King’s eare now then Sir Ch. Barkely and Sir H. Bennet
and my Lady Castlemayne, whose interest is now as great as ever.
And that Mrs. Haslerigge, the great beauty, is got with child and
now brought to bed, and lays it to the King or the Duke of York.
He tells me too, that my Lord St Albans is like to be Lord Treasurer;
all which things do trouble me much.
