Sir G. and I and his clerk, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Holt our
guide, over to Gosport, and so rode to Southampton. In our way,
besides my Lord Southamptons parks and lands, which in one
viewe we could see 6000] per annum, we observed alittle
churchyard, where the graves are accustomed to be all Sowed with
Sage. At Southampton we went to the Mayors and there dined, and
had Sturgeon of their own catching the last week. The towne is one
most gallant street — and is walled round with stone. Many old walls
of religious houses, and the Keye well worth seeing.
