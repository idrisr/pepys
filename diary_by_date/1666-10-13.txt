Atacommittee for Tanger. My Lord Bellasses propositions
were read and discoursed of, about reducing the garrison to less
charge. And endeed, I am mad in love with my Lord Chancellor,
for he doth comprehend and speak as well, and with the greatest
easiness and authority, that ever I saw man in my life. I did never
observe how much easier a man doth speak, when he knows all the
company to be below him, then in him; for though he spoke endeed
excellent well, yet his manner and freedom of doing it, as if he
played with it and was informing only all the rest of the company,
was mighty pretty. He did call again and again upon Mr. Povy for
his accounts. I did think fit to make the solemn tender of my
accounts that I entended. I said somethink that was liked, touching
the want of money and the bad Creditt of our tallies. My Lord
Chancellor moved that without any trouble to any of the rest of the
Lords, I might alone attend the King when he was with his private
council, and open the state of the garrison’s want of credit; and all
that could be done, should. Most things moved were referred to
committees, and so we broke up.
