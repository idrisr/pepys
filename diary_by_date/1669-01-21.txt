Upand walked to the Temple, it being frosty; and there took
coach, my boy Tom with me, and so to Whitehall to [a] Committee
of Tanger; where they met by and by and till twelve at noon upon
business; among others, mine, where my desire about being eased
of appointing and standing accountable for a Treasurer there was
well accepted, and they will think of some other way. Thence in my
own coach home, where I find Madam Turner, Dike, and
The[oph]. — and had a good dinner for them, and merry; and so
carried them to the Duke of York’s House (all but Dyke, who went
away on other business) and there saw The Tempest; but it is but ill
done, by Gosnell in lieu of Mall Davis. Thence set them at home,
and my wife and I to the Change; and so home, where my wife
mighty dogged; and vexed to see it, being mightily troubled of late
at her being out of humour, for fear of her discovering any new
matter of offence against me; though I am conscious of none, but do
hate to be unquiet at home. So late up, silent and not supping, but
hearing her utter some words of discontent to me with silence; and
so to bed weeping to myself for grief — which she discerning, came
to bed and mighty kind; and so, with great joy on both sides, to |
sleep.
