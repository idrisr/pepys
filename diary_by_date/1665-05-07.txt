After dinner came Mr. Andrews, and spent the afternoon with me
about our Tanger business of the victuals and then parted. And after
sermon comes Mr. Hill and a gentleman, a friend of his, one Mr.
Scott, that sings well also; and then comes Mr. Andrews, and we all
sung and supped; and then to sing again, and passed the Sunday
very pleasantly and soberly; and so I to my officea little, and then
home to prayers and to bed. Yesterday begun my wife to learn to
Limb of one Browne, which Mr. Hill helps her to. And by her
beginning, upon some eyes, I think she will [do] very fine things —
and I shall take great delight in it.
g. Up betimes, and to my business at the office, where all the
morning. At noon comes Mrs. The[oph]. Turner and dines with

great pleasure in thinking that my wife will really come to
something in that business. Here dined also Luellin. So after dinner
