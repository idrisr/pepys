My brother Tom came to me with Patternes to choose for a
suit. I paid him all to this day, and did give him rol upon account.
To Mr. Coventry, who told me that he would do me all right in my
business. To Sir G. Downing, the first visit I have made him since
he came. He is so stingy a fellow, I care not to see him. I quite
cleared myself of his office, and did give him liberty to take
anybody in. I went also this morning to see Mrs. Pierce the
Chyrurgeon. I found her in bed in her house in Margaret
churchyard — her husband returned to sea. | did invite her to go to
dinner with me and my wife today. After all this to my Lord, who
lay a-bed till 11 a-clock, it being almost 5 before he went to bed,
they supped so late last night with the King. After my Lord was
awake, I went up to him to the Nursery, where he doth lie; and
Se
having talked with himalittle, Itook leave and carried my wife and
Mrs. Pierce to Cloathworkers hall to dinner, where Mr. Pierce the
purser met us. We were invited by Mr. Chaplin the victualler,
where Nich. Osborne was. Our entertainment very good. A brave
hall. Good company and very good Musique. Where among other
things, I was pleased that I could find out a man by his voice, whom
I had never seen before, to be one that sung behind the Curtaine
formerly at Sir W. Davenants opera. Here Dr. Gauden and Mr.
Gauden the victualler dined with us. After dinner to Mr. Rawlin-
son’s to see him and his wife. And would have gone to my aunt
Wight, but that her only child, a daughter, died last night. Home
and to my Lord, who supped within; and Mr. Edwd. Mountagu,
Mr. Tho. Crew and others with him sat up late. Ihome and to bed.
