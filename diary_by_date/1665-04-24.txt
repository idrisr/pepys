To the Cockepitt, and there walked an hour with my Lord
Duke of Albemarle alone in his garden, where he expressed in great
words his opinion of me: that I was the right hand of the Navy here,
nobody but I taking any care of anything therein —so that he should
not know what could be done without me — at which I was (from
484
him) nota little proud. Thence to a Committee of Tanger — where,
because not a Quorum, little was done. And so away to my wife
(Creed with me) to my wife at Mrs. Pierces; who continues very
pretty and is now great with child. I had not seen her a great while.
Thence by coach to my Lord Treasurer’s, but could not speak with
Sir Ph. Warwicke. So by coach with my wife and Mercer to the
park; but the King being there, and I nowadays being doubtful of
being seen in any pleasure, did part from the Tour, and away out of
the park to Knightsbridge and there eat and drank in the coach, and
so home; and I, after a while at my office, home to supper and to bed
— having gota great Cold, Ithink by my pulling off my periwigg so
often.
