With the Comptroller at the office a little both forenoon and
afternoon; and at night stepa little with him to the Coffee-house,
where we light upon very good company and have very good
discourse concerning insects and their having a generative faculty as
well as other Creatures. This night in discourse the Comptroller
told me, among other persons that were heretofore the principall
officers of the Navy, there was one Sir Peter Bucke a Clerk of the
acts, of which to myself I was not a little proud.
