This morning before I went out I made even with my mayd
Jane, who hath this day been my maid three yeares and is this day to
go into the country to her mother. The poor girl cried, and I could
hardly forbear weeping to think of her going; for though she be
grown lazy and spoiled by Palls coming, yet I shall never have one
to please us better in all things, and so harmlesse, while I live. So I
paid her her wages and gave her 2s.- 6d. over, and bade her Adieu —
with my mind full of trouble for her going.
