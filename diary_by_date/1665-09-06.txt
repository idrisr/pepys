Busy all the morning writing letters to several. So to dinner—to
London to pack up more things thence; and there I looked into the
street and saw Fires burning in the street, as it is through the whole
City by the Lord Mayors order. Thence by water to the Duke of
Albemarle. All the way fires on each side the Thames; and strange
to see in broad daylight two or three Burialls upon the Bankeside,
one at the very heels of another — doubtless all of the plague — and
yet at least 40 or 50 people going along with every one of them.
