Up, and by coach to Westminster hall and the Parliament-
house, and there spoke with Mr. Coventry and others about
business; and so back to the Change, where no news more then that
the Dutch have, by consent of all the Provinces, voted no trade to be
suffered for 18 months, but that they apply themselfs wholly to the
465
war. And they say it is very true but very strange, for we use to
believe they cannot support themselfs without trade. Thence home
to dinner and then to the office, where all the afternoon and at night
tili very late; and then home to supper and bed, having a great cold,
got on Sunday last by sitting too long with my head bare for Mercer
to comb me and wash my eares.
