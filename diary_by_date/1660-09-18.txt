At home all the morning looking over my workmen in my
house. After dinner, Sir W. Batten, Pen, and myself by Coach to
Westminster hall, where we met Mr. Wayte that belongs to the
Treasurer; and so we went up to the Committee of Parliament
which are to consider of the debts of the army and navy, and did
give in our account of the 25 shipps.' Coll. Birch was very
impertinent* and troublesome. But at last we did agree to fit the
accounts of one ship more perfectly for their view within a few
days, that they might see what a trouble it is to do what they desire.
From thence, Sir Williams both going by water home, I took Mr.
Wayte to the Rhenish winehouse and drank with him and so parted.
