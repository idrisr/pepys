To the office, where the news is strong that not only the
Dutch cannot set out a fleet this year, but that the French will not;
and that he hath given that answer to the Dutch Imbassador, saying
that he is for the King of England’s having an honourable peace —
which, if true, is the best news we have heard a good while. At the
office all the morning; and there pleased with the little pretty
Deptford woman I have wished for long, and she hath occasion
given her to come again to me. After office, I to the Changea
little
and then home and to dinner; and then by coach with my wife to the
Duke of York’s House and there saw The Wits, a play I formerly
loved and is now corrected and enlarged — but though I like the
acting, yet I find not much in the play now. The Duke of York and
W. Coventry gone to Portsmouth makes me thus to go [to] plays.
So home; and to the office a little and then home, where I find
Goodgroome and he and Idid sing several things over and tried two
or three three-parts in Playford’s new book, my wife pleasing me in
singing her part of the things she knew; which is a comfort to my
very heart. So he being gone, we to supper and to bed.
