Waked this morning with news, brought me by a messenger
on purpose, that my Uncle Robert is dead —and died yesterday. Sol
rose, sorry in some respect; glad in my expectations in another
respect. So I made myself ready. Went and told my Uncle Wight —
my Lady —and some others thereof. And bought mea pair of boots
in St. Martins and got myself ready; and then to the post-house and
set out about 11 or 12 a-clock, taking the messenger with me that
came to me; and so we rode and got well by 9 a-clock to Brampton,
where I find my father well. My Uncles corps in a coffin, standing
upon joynt-stooles in the chimny in the hall; but it begun to smell,
and so I caused it to be set forth in the yard all night and wached by
two men. My auntI find in bedd in a most nasty ugly pickle, made
me sick to see it. My father and IJlay together tonight, I greedy to
see the Will but did not aske to see it till tomorrow.
