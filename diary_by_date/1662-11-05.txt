Up and with my painters, painting my dining-room all day
long till night, not stirring out at all. Only in the morning my Lady
Batten did send to speak with me and told me very civilly that she
did not desire, nor hopedI did, that anything should pass between
us but what was civill, though there was not the neighbourliness
between her and my wife that was fit to be; and so complained of
my maid’s mocking of her when she called ‘“‘Nan” to her maid
within her own house; my maid Jane in my yard overheard her and
mocked her. And some other such-like things she told me, and of
my wife’s speaking unhandsomely of her; to all which Idid give her
a very respectful answer, such as did please her, and am sorry
endeed that this should be, though I do not desire there should be
1. sc. abreast instead of in tandem.

any acquaintance between my wife and her. But I promised to
avoid such words and passages for the future; so home. At night I
called up my maids and schooled Jane; who did answer me so
humbly and drolly about it, that though I seemed angry, I was
much pleased with her, and wife also. So at night to bed.
