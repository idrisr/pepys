My head hath aked all night and all this morning with my last
night’s debauch. Called up this morning by Lieut. Lambert, who is
now made Captain of the Norwich; and he and I went down by
water to Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon
the things of a ship; he telling me all I asked him — which was of
good use to me. There we went and eat and drank and hear musique
at the Globe; and saw the simple motion that is there, of a woman
with a rod in her hand, keeping time to the music while it plays —
139
which is simple methinks.’ Back again by water, calling at Capt.
Lamberts house, which is very handsome and neat, and a fine
prospect at top. So to the office, where we sat a little. And then the
Captain and I again to Bridewell, to Mr. Holland; where his wife
also (a plain dowdy) and his mother was. Here came two young
gentlewomen to see Mrs. Holland and one of them could play
pretty well upon the viallin; but good God, how these ignorant
people did cry her up for it. We were very merry. I stayed and
supped here; and so home and to bed. The weather very hot; this
night I left off my wastecoate.
