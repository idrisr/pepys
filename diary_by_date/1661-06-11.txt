At the office this morning, Sir G. Carteret with us. And we
agreed upon a letter to the Duke of Yorke, to tell him the sad
condition of this office for want of money. How men are not able to
serve us more without some money. And that now, the credit of the
office is brought so low, that none will sell us anything without our
personal security given for the same. All the afternoon abroad
about several businesses; and at night home and to bed.
