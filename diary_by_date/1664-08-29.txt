Up betimes, intending to do business at my office, by § a-
clock. After dinner I to Westminster to Jervas’s a while; and so
doing many errands by the way, and necessary ones, I home. And
thither came the woman, with her mother, which our Will
recommends to my wife. I like her well, and I think will please us.
My wife and they agreed, and she is to come the next week — at
which I am very well contented, for then I hope we shall be settled;
but I must remember that never since Iwas housekeeper Iever lived
so quietly, without any noise or one angry word almost, as I have
done since my present maids, Besse, Jane and Susan, came and were
together. Now I have taken a boy and am taking a woman, I pray
God we may not be worse; but I will observe it. After being at my
office a while — home to supper and to bed.
