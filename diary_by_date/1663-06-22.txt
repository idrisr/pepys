Up betimes and to my office, reading over all our letters of the
office that we have writ since I came into the Navy — whereby to
bring the whole series of matters into my memory and to enter in
my manuscript some of them that are needful and of general
influence. By and by with Sir Wm. Batten by coach to Westmin-
ster, where I walked in the hall from one man to another. Hear that
the House is still divided about the manner of levying the Subsidys
which they entend to give the King, both as to the manner, the
time,and the number. Thence with Creed and bought a Lobster,
288
and then to an alehouse; where the maid of the house is a confident
merry lass and, if modest, is very pleasant to the customers that
come thither. Here we eat it, and thence to walk in the parke a good
while — the Duke being gone a-hunting; and by and by came in and
shifted himself, he having in his hunting, rather then go about, light
and led his horse through a River up to his breast, and came so
home; and when we were come, which was by and by, we went
into to him; and being ready, he retired with us and we had a long
discourse with him; but Mr. Creeds accounts stick still, through the
perverse ignorance of Sir G. Carteret, which I can[not] safely
control as I would. Thence to the park again and there walked up
and down an hour or two till night with Creede, talking; who is so
knowing and a man of that reason, that I cannot but love his
company, though I do not love the man, because he is too wise to be
made a friend of and acts all by interest and policy.
