Lay long with pleasure with my wife; and then up and to the
office, where all the morning; then home to dinner, and before
dinner I went into my green dining room; and there talking with
my brother upon matters relating to his Journy to Brampton
tomorrow and giving him good counsel about spending that time
which he shall stay in the country with my father, Ilooking another
way, I heard him fall down, and turned my head and he was fallen
down all along upon the ground, dead — which did put me into a
great fright; and to see my brotherly love, Idid presently lift him up
from [the] ground, he being as pale as death. And being upon his
legs, he did presently come to himself, and said he had something
come into his stomach, very hot; he knew not what it was, nor ever
had sucha fit before. I never was so frighted but once, when my
wife was ill at Ware upon the road. And I did continue trembling a
good while, and ready to weep to see him, he continuing mighty
pale all dinner, and melancholy, that I was loath to let him take his
journey tomorrow. But begun to be pretty well; and after dinner
my wife and Barker fell to singing, which pleased me pretty well,
my wife taking mighty pains and pride that she shall come to trill;
and endeed, I think she will. So to the office and there all the
_ afternoon late doing business; and then home and find my brother
pretty well. So to write a letter to my Lady Sandwich for him to
carry, I having not writ to her a great while. Then to supper and so
to bed. I did this night give him 20s. for books and as much for his
pocket, and 15s. to carry him down. And so to bed. Poor fellow, he
is so melancholy and withal, my wife says, harmless, that I begin to
love him, and would be loath he should not do well.
