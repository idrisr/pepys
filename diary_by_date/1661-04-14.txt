Easter. Lords day. In the morning towards my father’s. And by
the way heard Mr. Jacomb at Ludgate, upon these words, “‘Christ
loved you and therefore let us love one another.”’ And made a lazy
sermon, like a presbyterian. Then to my father’s and dined there,
and Dr. Fairbrother (lately come to town) with us. After dinner I
went to the Temple and there heard Dr. Griffith; a good sermon for
the day. So with Mr. Moore (whom I met there) to my Lord’s— and
there he showed me a Copy of my Lord Chancellor’s patent for
Earle, and I read the preamble, which is very short, modest, and
good. Here my Lord saw us and spoke to me about getting Mr.
Moore to come and governe his house while he goes to sea, which I
promised him to do. And did afterward speak to Mr. Moore and he
is willing. Then hearing that Mr. Barnwell was come with some of
my Lord’s children yesterday to town to see the Coronacion, Iwent
and found them at the Goate at Charing cross; and there I went and
drank with them a good while — whomI find in very good health
and very merry.
