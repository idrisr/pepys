Up, and to the office. At noon home to dinner, and all the
afternoon to my accounts again; and there find myself, to my great
joy, a great deal worth above 4oo0l, for which the Lord be praised —
and is principally occasioned by my getting soo! of Cocke for my
profit in his bargains of prize goods, and from Mr. Gawden’s
making me a present of 500/ more when I paid him 8000! for
Tanger. So to my office to write letters, then to my accounts again,
and so to bed, being in great ease of mind.
