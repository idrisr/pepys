Lords day. My wife got up to put on her mourning today and
to go church this morning. I up and set down myJournall for these
five days past. This morning came one from my father’s with a
black cloth coate, made of my short cloak, to walk up and down in.

To church, my wife and I with Sir W. Battin, where we heard of
Mr. Mills a very good sermon upon these words: ‘‘So run that you
may obtaine.”’ After sermon, with Mr. Pierce to Whitehall and
from thence to my Lord, but Diana did not come according to our
agreement. So calling at my father’s (where my wife had been this
afternoon but was gone home), I went home. This afternoon, the
King having news of the Princesses being come to Margetts, he and
the Duke of Yorke went down thither in Barges to her.
