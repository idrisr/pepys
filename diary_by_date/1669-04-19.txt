Up, and with Tom (whom, with his wife, I and my wife had
this morning taken occasion to tell that I did intend to give him 4ol
for himself and 2o0l to his wife toward their setting out in the world,
and that my wife would give her 20/ more, that so she might have as
much to begin with as he) by coach to Whitehall; and there having
IOIO
set him work in the robe-chamber to write something for me, I to
Westminster hall and there walked from 10 a-clock to past 12,
expecting to have met Deb; but whether she had been there before,
and missing me went away, or is prevented in coming and hath no
mind to come to me (the last whereof, as being most pleasing, as
showing most modesty, I should be most glad of) I know not; but
she not then appearing, I being tired with walking went home.
