Up, still in a constant pain in my back, which much afflicts me
with fear of the consequence of it. All the morning at the office; we
sat at the office extraordinary, upon the business of our stores; but
Lord, what a pitiful account the Surveyor makes of it grieves my
heart. This morning before I came out, I made a bargain with Capt.
Taylor fora ship for the Commissioners for Tanger, wherein Ihope
to get 40 or sol. To the Change and thence home and dined; and
then by coach to Whitehall, sending my wife to Mr. Hunts. At the
Committee for Tanger all the afternoon; where a sad consideration
to see things of so great weight managed in so confused a manner as
it is, so as Iwould not have the buying ofan acre of land bought by —
the Duke of Yorke and Mr. Coventry, for aught I see, being the
only two that do anything like men. Prince Robert doth nothing
but swear and laugha little, with an oath or two, and that’s all he
doth. Thence called my wife and home; andI late at my office and
so home to supper and bed, pleased at my hopes of gains by today’s
work, but very sad to think of the state of my health.
