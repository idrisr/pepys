Lords day. Up betimes, and to my chamber (itbeing a very wet
day all day, and glad I am that we did not go by water to see the
Soveraigne today as I entended), clearing all matters in packing up
my papers and books — and giving instructions in writing to my
Executors, thereby perfecting the whole business of my Will, to my
very great joy. So that I shall be in much better state of soul, I hope,
ifit should please the Lord to call me away this sickly time. At night
to read, being weary with this day’s great work. And then after
supper to bed, to rise betimes tomorrow. And to bed witha mind as
free as to the business of the world as ifI were not worth rool in the
whole world, everything being evened under my hand in my books
and papers; and upon the whole, I find myself worth (besides
Brampton estate) the sum of 21641 — for which the Lord be praised.
