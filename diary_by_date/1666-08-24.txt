Up, and despatched several businesses at home in the
morning; and then comes Sympson to set up my other new Presse
656
for my books; and so he and I
fell in to the Furnishing of my new
closet, and taking out the things out of my old. I kept him with me
all day, and he dined with me; and so all the afternoon, till it was
quite dark — hanging things; that is, my maps and picture[s] — and
Draughts — and setting up my books, and as much as we could do—
to my most extraordinary satisfaction; so that I think it will be as
noble a closet as any man hath, and light enough; though endeed, it
would be better to have hadalittle more light. He gone, my wife
and I to talk —and sup; and then to setting right my Tanger accounts
and enter my Journall; and then to bed, with great content in my
day’s work. This afternoon came Mrs. Barbary Shelden, now Mrs.
Wood, to see my wife. I was so busy, I would not see her. But she
came, it seems, mighty rich in rings and fine clothes, and likea lady;
and says she is matched mighty well — at which I am very glad, but
wonder at her good fortune and the folly of her husband — and
vexed at myself for not paying her the respect of seeing her. But I
will come out of her debt another time.
