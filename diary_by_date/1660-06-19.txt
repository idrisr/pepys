Much business at my Lord’s. This morning my Lord went
into the House of Commons and there had the thanks of the House,
in the name of the parliament and the Commons of England, for his
late service to his King and Country. My wife and the girl and dog
came home today. We were [told] of W. Howe being sick today;
but he was well at night. When I came home I found a Quantity of
Chocolatte left for me, but I know not from whom.
