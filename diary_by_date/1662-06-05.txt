To the Wardrobe; and there my Lord did enquire my opinion
of Mr. Moore, whichI did give to the best advantage I could, and
by that means shall get him joyned with Mr. Townesend in the
Wardrobe business. He did also give me all Mr. Sheplys and Mr.
Moores accounts to view — which I am glad of, as being his great
trust in me, and I would willingly keep up a good interest with him.

To dinner, and find Dr. Tho. Pepys at my house. But I was called
from dinner, by a note from Mr. Moore, to Ald. Backwells to see
some thousands of my Lord’s Crusados weighed. And we find that
3000 come to about $30 or 4ol generally.
