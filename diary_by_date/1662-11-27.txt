At my waking, I find the tops of the houses covered with
snow, which is a rare sight, that I have not seen these three years.
Up, and put my people to perfect the cleaning of my house, and so

wealthy citizens in their black velvet coats and gold chains (which
remain of their gallantry at the King’s coming in); but they stayed

Conduict in the quarrefour at the end of gracious street and cornhill;

people that were under it) I saw them pretty well go by. I could not

and there we met and sat till 7 a-clock, making a bargain with Mr.
Wood for his Masts of New England.
