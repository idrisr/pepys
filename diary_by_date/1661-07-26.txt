At home all the morning; and walking, met with Mr. Hill of
146
Cambrige in Popes head ally with some women with him; whom
he took and me into the taverne there and did give us wine. And
would fain seem to be very knowing in the affairs of state, and tells
me that the King would be forced to favour Presbytery, or the City
would leave him; but I heed not what he says, though upon enquiry
I do find that things in the Parliament are at a great disorder. Home
at noon, and there find-Mr. Moore and with him to an ordinary
alone and dined; and there he and I read my Uncles Will and I had
his opinion on it, and still find more and more trouble like to attend
it. Back to the office all the afternoon. And that done, home for all
night. Having the beginning of this week made a vowe to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it to unfit me to look after
business), and this day breaking of it against my will, I am much
troubled for it — but I hope God will forgive me.
