Sir G. Carteret told me how in most Cabaretts in France they
have writ upon the walls, in fair letters to be read, Dieu te regarde, as
a good lesson to be in every man’s mind. And have also, as in
Holland, their poor’s box; in both which places, at the making all
contracts and bargains they give so much, which they call God’s
penny.
