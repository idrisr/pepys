Up, and after an hour or two’s talk with my poor wife, who
gives me more and more content every day then other, I abroad by
coach to Westminster; and there met with Mrs. Martin, and she and
I over the water to Stangate; and after a walk in the fields, to the
King’s head and there spent an hour or two with pleasure with her,
and eat a tansy and so parted. And I to the New Exchange, there to
get a list of all the modern plays — which I entend to collect and to
have them bound up together. Thence to Mr. Hales; and there,
though against his perticular mind, Ihad my landskip done out, and
only a heaven made in the room of it; which though it doth not
please me thoroughly now it is done, yet it will do better then as it
was before.
