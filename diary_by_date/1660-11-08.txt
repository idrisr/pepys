This morning Sir Wm. and the Treasurer and I went by barge
with Sir Wm. Doyly and Mr. Prin to Deptford to pay off the
Henrietta, and have a good dinner. In the afternoon Comissioner
Pett and I went on board the [Dutch] Yaght;' which endeed is one
of the finest things that ever I saw for neatness and room in so small
a vessel. Mr. Pett is to make one to out-do this for the Honour of his
country, whichI fear he will scarce better.
