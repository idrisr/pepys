Lay some time talking with my wife in bed about Pall’s
business, and she doth conclude to have her married here and to be
merry at it; and to have W. Hewer and Batelier, and Mercer and
Willet bridemen and bridemaids, and to be very merry; and so lam
glad of it and do resolve to let it be done as soon as I can. So up and
to the office, where all the morning busy; and thence home to
dinner, and from dinner with Mercer (who dined with us) and wife
and Deb to the King’s House, there to see The Wildgoose chase,
which I never saw but have long longed to see, it being a famous
863
play; but as it was yesterday, I do find that where I expect most I
find least satisfaction, for in this play I met with nothing
extraordinary at all, but very dull inventions and designs. Knipp
came and sat by us, and her talk pleased mealittle, she telling me
how Mis Davis is for certain going away from the Duke’s House,
the King being in love with her; and a house is taken for her and
furnishing and she hath a ring given her already, worth 600/. That
the King did send several times for Nelly, and she was with him,
but what he did she knows not; this was a good while ago, and she
says that the King first spoiled Mrs. Weaver — which is very mean
methinks in a prince, and I am sorry for it — and can hope for no
good to the State from having a prince so devoted to his pleasure.
She told,me also of a play shortly coming upon the stage of Sir Ch.
Sidly’s, which she thinks will be called The Wandring Ladys, a
comedy that she thinks will be most pleasant; and also another play,
called The Duke of Lerma; besides Catelin, which she thinks, for
want of the clothes which the King promised them, will not be
acted for a good while. Thence home, and there to the office and did
some business; and so with my wife for half an hour walking by
moonlight and, it being cold frosty weather, walking in the garden;
and then home to supper, and so by the fireside to have my head
combed, as I do now often do, by Deb, whom I love should be
fiddling about me; and so to bed.
