At the office all the morning — where by Sir W. Penn I do hear
that the Seal was fetched away to the King yesterday from the Lord
Chancellor, by Secretary Morrice — which puts me into a great
horror, to have it done after so much debate and confidence that it
would not be done at last. When we rose I took a turn with Lord
Brouncker in the garden, and he tells me that he hath of late
discoursed about this business with Sir W. Coventry, who he finds
is the great man in the doing this business of the Chancellors, and
that he doth persevere in it, though against the Duke of York’s
opinion. After having wrote my letters at the office in the
afternoon, I in the evening to Whitehall to see how matters go; and
there I met with Mr. Ball of the Excise Office and he tells me that
the Seal is delivered to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, the man of the
whole nation that is the best spoken of and will please most people;
and therefore I am mighty glad of it. He was then at my Lord
Arlington’s, whither I went, expecting to see him come out; but
stayed so long, and Sir W. Coventry coming thither, whom I had
not a mind should see me there idle upon a post-night, I went home
without seeing him; but he is there with his Seal in his hand. So I
home; took up my wife, whomI left at Unthankes, and so home;
and after signing my letters, to bed. This day, being dissatisfied
with my wife’s learning so few songs of Goodgroome, I did come
to a new bargain with him, to teach her songs at so much, viz., Los.
a song; which he accepts of and will teach her.
