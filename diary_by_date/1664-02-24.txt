Ashwendesday. Up and by water, it being a very fine morning,
to Whitehall and there to speak with Sir Ph. Warrwicke, but he was
gone out to Chappell. So I spent much of the morning walking in
the park and going to the Queen’s chapel, where I stayed and saw
their masse till a man came and bid me go out or kneel down; so I
did go out. And thence to Somersett house and there into the
chapel, where Monsieur Despagne used to preach. But now it is
made very fine and was ten times more crowded then the Queen’s
chapel at St. James’s — which I wonder at. Thence down to the
355
garden of Somersett house and up and down the new building,
which in every respect will be mighty magnificent and costly. I
stayed a great while talking with a man in the garden that was
sawing a piece of marble—and did give him 6d. to drink. He told me
much of the nature and labour of that work; how he could not saw
above 4 inch. of the stone ina day; and ofa greater, not above one or
two. And after it is sawed, then it is rubbed with coarse and then
with finer and finer sand till they come to putty, and so polish it as
smooth as glass. Their saws have no teeth, but it is the sand only
which the saw rubs up and down that doth the thing. Thence by
water to the Coffee-house and there sat long with Ald. Barker,
talking of Hemp and that trade. And thence to the Changealittle;
and so home and dined with my wife, and then to the office till the
evening, and then walked a while merrily with my wife in the
garden; and so she gone, I to work again till late; and so home to
supper and to bed.
