Lords day. Up, and I to church, where I have not been these
many weeks before; and there did first find a strange Reader, who
could not find in the service-book the place for churching of
women, but was fain to change books with the Clerke. And then a
stranger preached, a seeming able man; but said in his pulpit that
God did a greater work in raising of a oake-tree from an akehorne
than a man’s body raising it at the last day from his dust (showing
the possibility of the Resurrection); which was methought a strange
saying. At home to dinner, whither comes and dines with me W.
How, and by invitation Mr. Harris and Mr. Banister, most
extraordinary company both, the latter for music of all sorts, the
former for everything. Here we sang, and Banister played on the
Theorbo. And afterward Banister played on his flagelette and I had
very good discourse with him about music, so confirming some of
my new notions about music that it puts me upona resolution to go
on and make a Scheme and Theory of music not yet ever made in
the world. Harris doth so commend my wife’s picture of Mr.
Hales’s, that I will have him draw Harris’s head; and he hath also
persuaded me to have Cooper draw my wife’s; which though it cost
301, yet I will have done.
