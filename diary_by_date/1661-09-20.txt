Will Stankes andI set out in the morning betimes for Gravely,
where to an alehouse and drank; and then to the Court — which was
a simple meeting of acompany of country rogues, with the Steward
and two Fellows of Jesus College, that are lords of the towne.
Where the Jury were sworne; and I producing no surrender (though
I told them I was sure there is and must be one somewhere), they
find my Uncle Tho. heire-at-law, as he is; and so though I did
advise them to forbear being admitted this Court, my uncle was
admitted; and his son also, in reversion after his father, which he did
well in to secure his money. The father paid a year and half for his
fine, and the son halfa year; in all 48/, besides about 31 fees. So that I
do believe the charges of his journys and other expenses herein,
cannot be less then 70! — which will be a sad thing for them if a
surrender be found. After all was done, Iopenly wished them joy in
it. And so rode to Offord with them and there parted fairly,
without any words. So with Stankes home and supped; and after
telling my father how things went, I went to bed with my mind in
good temper, because Isaw the matter and manner of the Court and
the bottom of my business, wherein Iwas before and should always
have been ignorant.
