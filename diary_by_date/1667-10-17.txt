Up;and being sent for by my Lady Batten, I to her and there
she found fault.with my not seeing her since her being a widow;
which I excused as well as I could, though it is a fault, but it is my
nature not to be forward in visits. But here she told me her
condition (which is good enough, being sole executrix, to the
disappointment of all her husband’s children). And here do see
what creatures widows are in weeping for their husbands, and then
presently leaving off; but I cannot wonder at it, the cares of the
841
world taking place of all other passions. Thence to the office —
where all the morning busy; and at noon home to dinner, where
Mr. John Andrews and his wife came and dined with me, and pretty
merry we were; only, I out of humour the greatest part of the
dinner, by reason that my people had forgot to get wine ready (I
having none in my house, which I cannot say now these almost
three years Ithink, without having two or three sorts), by which we
were fain to stay a great while while some could be fetched. When it
came, I begun to be merry, and merry we were; but it was an odd,
strange thing to observe of Mr. Andrews whata fancy he hath to
raw meat, that he eats it with no pleasure unless the blood run about
his chops; which it did now, by a leg of mutton that was not above
half-boiled; but it seems, at home all his meat is dressed so, and beef
and all, and eats it so at nights also. This afternoon my Lord
Anglesy tells us that the House of Commons have this morning run
into the enquiry in many things; as, the sale of Dunkirke, the
dividing of the fleet the last year, the business of the prizes with my
Lord Sandwich, and many other things; so that now they begin to
fall close upon it and God knows what will be the end of it, but a
committee they have chosen to inquire into the miscarriages of the
Warr.
