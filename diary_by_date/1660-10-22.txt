office day. After that to dinner at home upon some ribbs of
roast beef from the Cookes (which of late we have been forced to do
because of our house being alway under the painters’ and other
people’s hands, that we could not dress it ourselfs): after dinner to
my Lord’s, where I find all preparing for my Lord’s going to sea to
fetch the Queene tomorrow. At night my Lord came home, with
whomI stayed long and talked of many things. Among others, |
got leave of him to have his picture, that was done by Lilly,
coppyed. And talking of religion, I find him to be a perfect
Sceptique, and said that all things would not be well while there was
so much preaching, and that it would be better if nothing but
Homilys were to be read in churches. This afternoon (he told me),
there hath been a meeting before the’King and my Lord Chancellor
of some Episcopalian and Presbyterian Divines; but what hath
passed he could not tell me. After I had done talk with him, I went
to bed with Mr. Sheply in his Chamber, but could hardly get any
sleep all night, the bed being ill-made and hea bad bedfellow.
