Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning; among
406
other things, making a contract with Sir W. Warren for almost 1000
Gottenburg masts, the biggest that ever was made in the Navy and
wholly of my composing, and a good oneI hope it is for the King.
Dined at Sir W. Batten, where I have not eat these many months.
Sir G. Carteret, Mr. Coventry, Sir J. Mennes and myself there
only, and my Lady. A good venison pasty, and very merry and
pleasant I made myself with my Lady, and she as much to me. This
morning to the office comes Nich. Osborne, Mr. Gauden’s clerk,
to desire of me what piece of plate I would choose to have, a 10ol/ or
thereabouts, bestowed upon me in — he having order to lay out so
much, and out of his freedom with me doth of himself come to
make this question: I a great while urged my unwillingness to take
any, not knowing how I could serve Mr. Gauden; but left it wholly
to himself. So at noon I find brought home in fine leather cases a
pair of the noblest Flaggons that ever I saw all days of my life.
Whether I shall keep them or no, I cannot tell; for it is to oblige me
to him in that business of the Tanger victualing, wherein I doubt I
shall not; but glad Iam to see that I shall be sure to get something on
one side or other, have it which will. So with a merry heart, |
looked upon them and locked them up. Thence to Westminster and
to Mrs. Lane’s lodging to give her joy. And there suffered me to
deal with her as I used to do; and by and by her husband comes, a
sorry simple fellow, and his letter to her, which she proudly
showed me, a simple, silly, nonsensical thing. A man of no
discourse, and I fear married her to make a prize of; which he is
mistaken in. And a sad wife I believe she will prove to him, for she
urged me to appoint a time, as soon as he is gone out of town, to
give her a meeting next week.
