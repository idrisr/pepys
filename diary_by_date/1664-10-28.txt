Slept ill all night, having got a very great cold the other day at
Woolwich in head, which makes me full of snot. Up in the
morning, and my tailor brings me home my fine new coloured
cloth suit, my cloak lined with plush, as good a suit as ever Iwore in
my life and mighty neat, to my great content. To my office, and
there all the morning. At noon to Nellsons and there bought 20
pieces more of Bewpers, and hope to go on with him to a contract.
Thence to the Changealittle; and thence home with Luellin to
dinner, where Mr. Deane met me by appointment; and after dinner
he and Iup to my chamber and there hard at discourse, and advising
him what to do in his business at Harwich; and then to discourse of
our old business of Ships, and taking new rules of him to my great
pleasure; and he being gone, I to my officea
little and then to see Sir
W. Batten, who is sick of a greater cold then I; and thither comes to
me Mr. Holliard, and into the chamber to me; and poor man
(beyond all I ever saw of him), was a
little drunk, and there sat
talking and finding acquaintance with Sir W. Batten and my Lady
by relations on both sides, that there we stayed very long. At last
broke up and he home, much overcome with drink — but well
enough to get well home. So I home to supper and to bed.
