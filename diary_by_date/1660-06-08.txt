Out early. Took horse at Deale. I troubled much with the
King’s Gittar and Fairebrother, the rogue that I entrusted with the
carrying of it on foot, whom I thought I had lost. Came to
Canterbury; dined there. I saw the Minster and the remains of
Beckett’s tombe. Came to Gravesend. A good handsome wench I
kissed, the first that I have seen a great while. Supped with my
Lord.
