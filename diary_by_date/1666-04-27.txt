Up (taking Balty with me, who lay at my house last [night] in
order to his going away today to sea with the pursers of the Henery,
whom I appointed to call him). Abroad to many several places
about several businesses: to my Lord Treasurer’s, Westminster, and
Iknow not where. At noon to the Changealittle, and then bespoke
some maps to hang in my new Roome (my boy’s room), which will
be very pretty. Home to dinner; and after dinner to the hanging up
of maps and other things for the fitting of the room, and now it will
certainly be one of the handsomest and most useful rooms in my
house — so that what with this room and the room on my leads, my
house is half as good again as it was. All this afternoon about this,
till I was so weary, and it was late, I could do no more, but finished
the room; so I did not get out to the office all the day long. At night
spent a good deal of time with my wife and Mercer, teaching them a
song; and so after supper, to bed.
