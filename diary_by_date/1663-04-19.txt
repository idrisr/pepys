Easterday. Up, and this day put on my close-kneed colourd
suit; which, with new stockings of that colour, with belt and new
gilt-handle sword, is very handsome. To church alone. And so to
dinner, where my father and brother Tom dined with us. And after
dinner to church again, my father sitting below in the chancel. After
church done (where the young scotchman preaching,Islept all the
while) my father and Isee my uncle and aunt Wight; and after a stay
of an hour there, my father to my brothers and I home to supper.
And after supper fell in discourse of dancing, andI
find that Ashwell
hath a very fine carriage, which makes my wife almost ashamed of
herself to see herself so outdonne; but tomorrow she begins to learn
to dance for a month or two. So to prayers and to bed — my Will
being gone with my leave to his father’s this day for a day or two, to
take physique these holidays.
