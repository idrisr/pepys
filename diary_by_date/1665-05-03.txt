Up betimes, and walked to Sir Ph. Warwickes, where a long
time with him in his chamber alone, talking of Sir G. Carteret’s
business and the abuses he puts on the nation by his bad payments —
to both our vexations; but no hope of remedy for aught I see. So to
the Change and thence home to dinner; and so out to Gresham
College and saw a cat killed with the Duke of Florence’s poison.
And saw it proved that the oyle of Tobacco, drawn by one of the
Society, doth the same effect, and is judged to be the same thing
with the poison, both in colour and smell and effect. (Isaw also an
abortive child, preserved fresh in spirit of salt). Thence parted, and
to Whitehall to the council chamber about an order touching the
Navy (our being impowered to commit seamen or maisters that do
not, being hired or pressed, fallow their work), but they could give
us none. So, alittle vexed at that, because I put in the memorial to
the Duke of Albemarle alone, under my own hand — home; and
after some time at the office, home to bed.
