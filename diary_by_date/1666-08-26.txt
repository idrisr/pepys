Lords day. Up betimes, and to the finishing the setting things
in order in my new closet out of my old; which I did thoroughly by
the time sermon was done at church — to my exceeding joy; only, I
was a
little disturbed with news my Lord Bruncker brought me,
that we are to attend the King at Whitehall this afternoon, and that it
is about a complaint from the Generals’ against us. Sir W. Penn
dined by invitation with me, his Lady and daughter being gone into
the country. We very merry. After dinner we parted, and I to my
office, whither I sent for Mr. Lewes and instructed myself fully in
the business of the victualling, to enable me to answer in that

stayed till the King and Cabinet was met in the green Chamber, and
then were called in; and there the King begun with me, to hear how
the victualls of the fleet stood; Idid in long discourse tell him and the
rest (the Duke of York, Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, both the
Secretarys, Sir G.-Carteret, and Sir W. Coventry) how it stood;

not going, or too soon returning from the Duch coast, this next
bout, to the want of victuals. Then they proceeded to the enquiry
after the fireships; and did all very superficially — and without any

severity at all. But however, I was in pain, after we came out, to
know how I had done — and hear, well enough. But however, it
shall be a caution to me to prepare myself against a day of
inquisition.
