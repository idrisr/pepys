Up by 3 a-clock this morning and rode to Cambrige, and was
there by 7 a-clock. Where after I was trimmed, I went to Christ
College and find my brother John at 8 a-clock in bed, which vexed
me. Then to Kings College chappell, where I find the schollers in
their surplices at the service with the organs — which is a strange
sight to what it used in my time to be here. Rode to Impington —
where I find my old Uncle? setting all alone, like a man out of the
world. He can hardly see; but all things else he doth pretty livelyly.
Then with Dr. John Pepys and him, I read over the Will and had
their advice therein; who, as to the sufficiency thereof, confirmed
_ me, and advised me as to the other parts thereof.
16-19. These four days we spent in putting things in order —
letting of the cropp upon the ground — agreeing with Stankes to
have a care of our business in our absence, and we think ourselfs in
nothing happy but in lighting upon him to be our bayly — in riding
to Offord and Sturtlow, and up and down all our lands; and in the
evening walking, my father and I, about the fields talking. To
supper and to bed — my aunt continuing in her base hypocriticall
tricks.
