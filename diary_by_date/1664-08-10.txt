Up; and being ready, abroad to do several small businesses;
among others, to find out one to engrave my tables upon my new
sliding-Rule with silver plates, it being so small that Browne that
made it cannot get one to do it. So I found out Cocker, the famous
writing master, and got him to do it; and I sat an hour by him to see
him design it all, and strange it is to see him with his natural eyes to
cut so small at his first designing it, and read it all over without any
missing, when for my life I could not with my best skill read one
word or letter of it — but it is use; but he says that the best light, for
his life, to do a very small thing by (contrary to Chaucer’s words to
the sun: that he should lend his light to them that small seals grave),
it should be by an artificiall light of a candle, set to advantage as he
could do it. I find the fellow, by his discourse, very ingenuous; and
among other things, a great admirer and well read in all our English
poets and undertakes to judge of them all, and that not imperti-
nently. Well pleased with his company and better with his
beginning upon my Rule, I left him and home; whither Mr. Deane
by agreement came to me and dined with me, and by chance
Gunner Batters’s wife. Thence I to Cockers again and sat by him,
with good discourse again for an hour or two; and then left him and
by agreement with Capt. Sylas Taylor (my old acquaintance at the
Exchequer) to the post-office to hear some Instrument Musique of
Mr. Berchenshaws before my Lord Brunkard and Sir Rob.
Murrey. I must confess, whether it be that I hear it but seldom, or
that really voices is better, but so it is, that I found no pleasure at all
init, and methought two voyces were worth twenty of it. So home
to my office a while, and then to supper and to bed.
