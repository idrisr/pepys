St. Valentine. This morning comes betimes Dicke Pen to be
my wife’s valentine, and came to our bedside. By the same token, I
had him brought to my side, thinking to have made him kiss me;
but he perceived me, and would not. So went to his Valentine —a
notable, stout, witty boy. I up, about business; and opening the
doore, there was Bagwell’s wife, with whom Italked afterwards
and she had the confidence to say she came with a hope to be time
enough to be my Valentine, and so endeed she did — but my oath
preserved me from losing any time with her. And so I and my boy
abroad by coach to Westminster, where did two or three busi-
nesses; and then home to the Change, and did much business there.
My Lord Sandwich is, it seems, with his fleet at Alborough bay. So
home to dinner, and then to the office, where till 12 almost at night,
468
and then home to supper and to bed.
