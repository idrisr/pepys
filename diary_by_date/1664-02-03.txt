In Covent garden tonight, going to fetch home my wife, I
stopped at the great Coffee-house there, where Inever was before —
where Draydon the poet (I knew at Cambrige) and all the wits of
the town, and Harris the player and Mr. Hoole of our college; and
had Ihad time then, or could at other times, it will be good coming
thither, for there Iperceive is very witty and pleasant discourse. But
I could not tarry and it was late; they were all ready to go away.
