Up and to the office, where all the [morning], also after
dinner, and there late, despatching much business; and then home
to supper and with my wife, and to get her to read to me. And here
did find that Mr. Sheres hath, beyond his promise, not only got me
4a candlestick made me, after a form he remembers to have seen in
Spain, for keeping the light from one’s eyes, but hath got it done in
silver, very neat, and designs to give it me in thanks for my paying
him his rool in money for his service at Tanger which was ordered
him. But I do intend to force him to make me [pay] for it. But I yet,
without his direction, cannot tell how it is to be made use of. So
after a little reading, to bed.
