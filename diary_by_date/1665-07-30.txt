Lord’s day. Up, and in my nightgown, cap, and neckcloth,
undressed all day long; lost not a minute, but in my chamber setting
my Tanger accounts to rights, which I did by night, to my very
heart’s content; not only that it is done, but I find everything right
and even beyond what, after so long neglecting them, I did hope
for. The Lord of Heaven be praised for it. Will was with me today
and is very well again. It was a sad noise to hear our Bell to toll and
ring so often today, either for deaths or burials; I think five or six
times. At night, weary with the day’s work but full of joy at my
having done it —I to bed, being to rise betimes tomorrow to go to
the wedding at Dagenhams. So to bed — fearing I have got some
cold sitting in my loose garment all this day.
