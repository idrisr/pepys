By water to the Exchequer, and there up and down through
all the offices to strike my tallies for 175001 — which methinks is so
great a testimonyof the goodness of God to me; that I, from a mean
clerk there, should come to strike tallies myself for that sum, and in
the authority that I do now, is a very stupendous mercy to me. I
shall have them struck tomorrow. But to see how every little fellow
looks after his fees, and to get what he can for everything, is a
strange consideration — the King’s Fees, that he must pay himself
for this 175001, coming to above tool. Thence, called my wife at
Unthankes, to the New Exchange and elsewhere to buy a lace band
for me, but we did not buy. But I find it so necessary to have some
handsome clothes, that I cannot but lay out some money there-
upon.
