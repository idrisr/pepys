Lords day. Up, andto church, myself and wife— where that old
dunce Meriton, brother to the known Meriton of St. Martins of
Westminster, did make a very good sermon, beyond my expec-
tation. Home to dinner, and we carried in Pegg Pen and there also
came to us little Michell and his wife, and dined very pleasantly.
Anon to church, my wife and I and Betty Michell, her husband
being gone to Westminster. After church, home, and I to my
chamber and there did finish the putting time to my song of It is
decreed. And do please myself at last, and think it will be thought a
good song. By and by little Michell comes and takes away his wife
home, and my wife and brother and I to my Uncle Wights, where
my aunt is grown so ugly, and their entertainment so bad, that lam
in pain to be there, nor will go thither again a good while ifsent for—
for we were sent for tonight; we had not gone else. Woolly’s wife a
silly woman and not very handsome, but no spirit in her at all— and
their discourse mean. And the fear of the troubles of the times hath
made them not to bring their plate to town since it was carried out
upon the business of the Fire, so that they drink in earth and a
wooden can, which I do not like. So home, and my people to bed. I
late to finish my song, and then to bed also. And the business of the
firing of the City, and the fears we have of new troubles and
violences, and the fear of fire among ourselfs, did keep me awake a
good while, considering the sad condition I and my family should
be in. So at last to sleep.
