The Queene of England (as she is now owned and called) I
hear, doth keep open Court and distinct at Lisbone. Thence, much
against my nature and will (yet such is the power of the Devil over
me I could not refuse it) to the Theatre and saw The Merry Wifes of
Windsor, ill done. And that ended, with Sir W. Pen and Sir G. Ascue
to the Taverne and so home with him by coach. And after supper to
prayers and to bed —in full quiet of mind as to thought, though full
of business, blessed be God.
