Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon
home, and there to dinner with my clerks and Mr. Pelling, and had
a very good dinner; among others, a haunch of venison boiled, and
merry we were. And Irose soon from dinner, and with my wife and
girl to The King’s House and there saw The Mad Couple, which is
but an ordinary play; but only, Nells and Hearts mad parts are most
excellently done, but especially hers; which makes it a miracle to me
856
to think how ill she doth any serious part, as the other day, just likea
fool or changeling; and in a mad part, doth beyond all imitation
almost. Many fine faces here today. It pleased us mightily to see the
natural affection of a poor woman, the mother of one of the
children brought on the stage — the child crying, she by force got
upon the stage, and took up her child and carried it away off of the
stage from Hart. Thence home, and there to the office late and then
home to supper and to bed.
