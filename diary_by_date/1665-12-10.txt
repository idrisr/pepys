Lords day. Lay long talking, Hill and I, with great pleasure,
and then up; and being ready, walked to Cocke’s for some news,
but heard none; only, they would have us stay their dinner, and sent
for my wife, who came, and very merry we were — there being Sir
Edm. Pooly and Mr. Eveling. Before we had dined comes Mr.
Andrews, whom we had sent for to Bow, and so after dinner,
home; and there we sang some things, but not with much pleasure,
Mr. Andrews being in so great haste to go home, his wife looking
561
every hour to be brought to bed. He gone, Mr. Hill andIcontinued
our Musique, one thing after another, late till supper; and so to bed
with great pleasure.
