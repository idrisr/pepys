Twelfth day. After dinner to the Dukes house and there saw
Twelfth night acted well, though it be buta silly play and not relating
at all to the name or day. Thence Mr. Battersby (the apothecary),
his wife and I and mine by coach together, and setting him down at
his house, he paying his share, my wifc and Ihome and find all well.
Only, myself somewhat vexed at my wife’s neglect in leaving of
her scarfe, waistcoat, and night-dressings in the coach today that
brought us from Westminster, though I confess she did give them
to me to look after — yet it was her fault not to see that I did take
them out of the coach. I believe it might be as good as 25s. loss or
thereabouts. So to my office, however, to set down my last three
days’ Journall, and writing to my father about my sending him
some wine and things this week for his making an entertainment of
some friends in the country, and so home. This night making an
end wholly of Christmas, witha mind fully satisfyed with the great
pleasures we have had by being abroad from home. And I do find
my mind so apt to run to its old wont of pleasures, that it is high
time to betake myself to my late vows, which I will tomorrow,
God willing, perfect and bind myself to, that so I may for a great
while do my duty, as I have well begun, and encrease my good
name and esteem in the world and get money, which sweetens all
things and whereof I have much need.
