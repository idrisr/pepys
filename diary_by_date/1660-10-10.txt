office day all the morning. At night comes Mr. Moore and
stayed late with me to tell me how Sir Hards: Waller (who only
pleads guilty), Scott, Cooke, Peters, Harrison, &c. were this day
arraigned at the bar at the Sessions house,’ there being upon the
bench the Lord Mayor, Gen. Monke, my Lord of Sandwich, &c.;
such a bench of noblemen as hath not been ever seen in England.
They all seem to be dismayed and will all be condemned without
Question. In Sir Orland. Brigeman’s charge, he did wholly rip up

Blackburne formerly would not upon any terms have done. After
we had done there, Mr. Creed and I to the Leg in King street to
dinner, where he and I and my Will had a good udder to dinner; and
from thence to walk in St. James’s Park — where we observed the
several engines at work to draw up water, with which sight I was
very much pleased. Here in the park we met with Mr. Salsbury,
who took Mr. Creed and me to the Cockpitt to see The Moore of
Venice, which was well done. Burt acted the Moore; by the same
token, a very pretty lady that sot by me cried to see Desdimona
smothered.
