Lords day. Up and to church, where Mr. Mills; a lazy, simple
sermon upon the Devil’s having no right to anything in this world.
So home to dinner; and after dinner I and my boy down by water to
Redriffe; and thence walked to Mr. Evelin’s, where I walked in his
garden till he came from church, with great pleasure reading Ridlys
discourse all my way going and coming, upon the Civill and
Ecclesiastical Law. He being come home, he and I walked together
in the garden with mighty pleasure, he being a very ingenious man,
and the more I know him, the more I love him. His chief business
with me was to propose having my Cosen Tho. Pepys in
Commission of the Peace; which I do not know what to say to till I
speak with him, but should be glad of it— and will put him upon it.
Thence walked back again, reading; and so took water and home,
where I find my Uncle and Aunt Wight and supped with them upon
my leads with mighty pleasure and mirth. And they being gone, I
mighty weary to bed, after having my hair of my head cut shorter,
even close to my skull, for coolness, it being mighty hot weather.
