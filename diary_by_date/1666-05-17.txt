To the office, where all the morning, with fresh occasions of
vexing at myself for my late neglect of business, by which I cannot
617
appear half so useful as I used to do. Home at noon to dinner, and
then to my office again, where I could not hold my eyes open for an
hour, but I drowsed (so little sensible I apprehend my soul is of my
necessity of minding business). But I anon wakened and minded
my business, and did a very great deal with very great pleasure; and
so home at night to supper and to bed — mightily pleased with
myself for the business that I have done, and convinced that if I
would but keep constantly to do the same, I might have leisure
enough and yet do all my business; and by the grace of God, so I
will. So to bed.
