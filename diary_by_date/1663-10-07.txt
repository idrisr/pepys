They wrought in the morning and I did keep my bed; and my
pain continued on me mightily, that Ikeeped within all day in great
pain, and could break no wind nor have any stool after my physic
had done working. So in the evening I took coach and to Mr.
Hollyards, but he was not at home; and so home again. And
whether the coach did me good or noI know not, but having a good
fire in my chamber, I begun to break six or seven small and great
farts; and so to bed and lay in good ease all night, and pissed pretty
well in the morning, but no more wind came as it used to do
plentifully, after it once begun, nor any inclination to stool.
