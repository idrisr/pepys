The wind all this day was very high —so that a gentleman that
was at dinner with my Lord that came along with Sir John Bloys
(who seemed a fine man) was forced to rise from table. This
afternoon came a great paquet of letters from London directed to
me; among the rest, two from my dear wife, the first that I have
since my coming away from London. All the news from London is
that things go ever further toward a King. That the Skinners
Company the other day at their entertaining of Gen. Monke had
took down the Parliament arms in their Hall and set up the Kings.
In the evening my Lord and I hada great deal of discourse about the
several Captaines of the fleet and his interest among them, and had
his mind clear to bring in the King. He confessed to me that he was
not sure of his own Captain to be true to him, and that he did not
like Capt. Stokes. At night W. Howe and | at our viallins in my
cabin, where Mr. Ibbott and the Lieutenant were late. I stayed the
Lieutenant late, showing him my manner of keeping a Journall.
After that, to bed. It comes now in my mind to observe that I am
sensible that I have beenalittle too free to make mirth with the
Minister of our ship, he being a very sober and an upright man.
