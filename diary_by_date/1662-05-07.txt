Walked to Westminster; where I understand the news that Mr.
Mountagu is this last night come to the King, with news that he left
the Queene and fleet in the bay of Biscay, coming this way-ward,
and that he believes she is now at the Isle of Scilly. So at noon to my
Lord Crewes and there dined; and after dinner Sir Tho. Crew and I
talked together; and among other instances of the simple light
discourse that sometimes is in the Parliament house, he told me
how in the late business of Chymny-money, when all occupyers
were to pay, it was questioned whether women were under that
name to pay, and somebody rose and said that they were not
occupiers, but occupied.
