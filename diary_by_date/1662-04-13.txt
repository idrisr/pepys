Lords day. Sir W. [Batten] comes to me to bring me a paper of
Fieldes (with whom we have lately had a great deal of trouble at the
office), being a bitter petition to the King against our office, for not
doing Justice upon his complaint to us of embezzlement of the
King’s stores by one Turpin.! I took Sir Wm. to Sir W. Pens (who
was newly come from Walthamstowe), and there we read it and
discoursed; but we do not much fear it, the King referring it to the
Duke of Yorke. So we drank a glass or two of wine; and so home
and I to bed — my wife being in bed already.
