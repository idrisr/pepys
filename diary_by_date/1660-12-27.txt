With my wife to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where much and
good company. Good and much entertainment. My wife, not very
well, went home. I stayed late there, seeing them play at cards; and
so home and to bed. This afternoon there came ina
strange lord to
Sir W. Batten’s by a mistake and enters discourse with him, so that
we could not be rid of him till Sir Arn. Brames and Mr. Bens and Sir
Wm. fell a-drinking to him till he was drunk, and so sent him away.
About the middle of the night I was very ill, I think with eating and
drinking too much; and so I was forced to call the mayde (who
pleased my wife and I in her running up and down so inocently in
her smock) and vomited in the bason; and so to sleep, and in the
morning was pretty well—only got cold and so have pain in pissing,
as I used to have.
