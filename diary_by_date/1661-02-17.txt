Lords day. A most tedious, unseasonable, and impertinent
sermon by an Irish Doctor. His text was “Scatter them, O Lord,
that delight in warr.” Sir Wm. Batten and I very much angry with
the parson. And so Ito Westminster as soon as Icame home. To my
Lord’s — where I dined with Mr. Sheply and Howe. After dinner
(without speaking to my Lord), Mr. Sheply and I into the City.
And so Ihome and took my wife to my Uncle Wights and there did
Supp with them; and so home again — and to bed.
