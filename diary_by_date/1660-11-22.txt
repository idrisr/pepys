This morning came the Carpenters to make me a door at the
other side of my house, going into the Entry — which I was much
pleased with. At noon my wife and I walked to the old Exchange;
and there she bought her a white whiske and put it on, and Ja pair of
gloves; and so we took coach for Whitehall to Mr. Foxes — where
we found [Mrs. Foxe] within, and an alderman of London paying a
1000! or 1400! in gold upon the table for the King, which was the
most gold that ever I saw together in my life. Mr. Fox came in
presently and did receive us with a great deal of respect. And then
did take my wife and I to the Queenes presence-Chamber. Where
he got my wife placed behind the Queenes chaire and I got into the
Crowd; and by and by the Queen and the two princesses came to
dinner. The Queen, a very little plain old woman and nothing more
in her presence in any respect nor garbe then any ordinary woman.
The Princesse of Orange I have often seen before. The Princess
Henriettee is very pretty, but much below my expectation —and her
dressing of herself with her haire frized short up to her eares did
make her seem so much the less to me. But my wife, standing near
her with two or three black paches on and well dressed, did seem to
me much handsomer then she. I took Coach for my wife and |
homewards; and I light at the Maypoole in the Strand and sent my
wife home. I to the new playhouse and saw part of The Traytor (a
very good Tragedy); where Moone did act the Traytor very well.
