Lay long with pleasure, talking with my wife —- in whom |
never had greater content, blessed be God, then now; she
continuing with the same care and thrift and innocence (so long as I
keep her from occasions of being otherwise) as ever she was in her
life, and keeps the house as well. To church, where Mills (after he
had read the service and shifted himself as he did the last day)
preached a very ordinary sermon. So home to dinner with my wife.
Then up into my new rooms, which are almost finished, and there
walked with great content, talking with my wife till church time,
and then to church; and there being a lazy preacher, I sleep out the
sermon and so home.
