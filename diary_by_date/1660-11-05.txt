Office day. Being disappointed of money, we failed of going to
Deptford to pay off the Henriette today. Dined at home; and at
home all the day and at the office at night, to make up an account of
91
what the debts of 19 of the 25 ships that should have been paid off is
encreased since the adjournment of the Parliament — they being to
sit again tomorrow. This 5 of November is observed exceeding
well in the City; and at night great bonefires and fireworks. At
night Mr. Moore came and sat with me, and there Itook a book and
he did instruct me in many law-notions, in which I took great
pleasure. To bed.
