Up, and to work, having Carpenters come to help in setting
670
up bedsteads and hangings; and at that trade my people and I all the
morning, till pressed by public business to leave them, against my
will, in the afternoon; and yet I was troubled in being at home, to
see all my goods lie up and down the house in a bad condition, and
strange workmen going to and fro might take what they would |
almost. All the afternoon busy; and Sir W. Coventry came to me,
and found me, as God would have it, in my office, and people about
me setting my papers to rights; and there discoursed about getting
an account ready against the Parliament, and thereby did create me
infinite of business, and to be done on a sudden, which troubled me;
but however, he being gone, I about it late to good purpose; and so
home, having this day also got my wine outof the ground again and
set it in my cellar; but with great pain to keep the portfer]s that
carried it in from observing the money-chests there. So to bed as
last night; only, my wife and I upon a bedstead with curtains in that
which was Mercer’s chamber, and Balty and his wife (who are here
and do us good service) where we lay last night.
