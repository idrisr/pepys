1666-11-12

This afternoon, going toward Westminster, Creed and I did
step [in] (the Duke of York being just going away from seeing of it)
691
at Pauls, and in the Convocation house yard did there see the body
of Robt. Braybrooke, Bishop of London, that died 1404. He fell
down in his tomb out of the great church into St. Fayths this late
Fire, and is here seen his Skeleton with the flesh on; but all tough
and dry like a spongy dry leather or Touchwood all upon his bones.
His head turned aside. A great man in his time, and Lord Chancellor
— and now exposed to be handled and derided by some, though
admired for its duration by others. Many flocking to see it.
