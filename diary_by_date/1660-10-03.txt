With Sir W. Batten and Pen by water to Whitehall, where a
meeting of the Dukes of Yorke and Albermarle, my Lord Sandwich
and all the Principal Officers, about the Winter gard; but we
determined of nothing. From thence to my Lord’s, who sent a great
iron chest to Whitehall; and I saw it carried into the King’s closet,
where I saw most incomparable pictures. Among the rest, a book
open upon a deske which I durst have sworn was a reall book, &c.
Back again to my Lord and dined all alone with him, who doth treat
me with a great deal of respect. And after dinner did discourse an
houre with me and advise about getting of some way to get himself
some money to make up for all his great expenses — saying that he
believed he might have anything that he would ask of the King.
This day I heard the Duke’ speak of a great design that he and my
Lord of Pembrooke have, and a great many others, of sending a
venture to some parts of affrica to dig for gold ore there. They
entend to admit as many as will venture their money, and so make
themselfs a company. 2501 is the lowest share for every man. But I
do not find that my Lord doth much like it.
