So soon as word was brought me that Mr. Coventry was
come with the barge to the Tower, I went to him and find him
reading of the psalmes in shorthand (which he is now busy about);
and had good sport about the long marks that are made there for
128
sentences in Divinity, which he is never like to make use of. Here he
andIsat till the Comptroller came; and then we put off for Deptford
— where we went on board the Kings pleasure-boat that Comis-
sioner Pett is making; and endeed, it will be a most pretty thing.
From thence to Comissioner Petts lodging and there had a good
breakefast; and in come the two Sir Wms from Walthamstow. And
so we sat down and did-a great deal of public business about the
fitting of the fleet that is now going out.
