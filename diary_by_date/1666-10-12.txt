Up, and after taking leave of my poor father, who is setting
out this day for Brampton by the Cambrige coach, he having taken
a journey to see the city burned and to bring my brother to town-I
out by water; and so [by] coach to St. James’s, the weather being
foul —and there from Sir W. Coventry do hear how the House hath
cut us off 150000! of our wear and tear— for that which was saved by
the King while the fleet lay in harbour in winter. However, he
seems pleased, and so am I, that they have abated no more — and do
intend to allow of 28000 men for the next year; and this day have
appointed to declare the sum they will give the King, and to
propose the way of raising it — so that this is likely to be the great
day. After done in his chamber, I with him to Westminster hall and
there took a few turns, the Hall mighty full of people and the House
likely to be very full today about the money business. Thence to
Mrs. Martin’s lodging and did what I would with her. She is very
big, and resolves I must be godfather. Thence away by water with
Cropp to Deptford. It was almost night before I got thither, so I
only did give direction concerning a press that Ihave making there,
to hold my turning and Joyners tooles that were lately given me,
which will be very handsome; and so away back again, it being now
dark; and so home, and there find my wife come home and hath
brought her new Girle I have helped her to of Mr. Falconbrige’s.
She is wretched poor and but ordinary favoured, and we fain to lay
out seven or eight pound-worth of clothes upon her back, which
methinks doth go against my heart, and do not think I can ever
esteem her as I could have done another that had come fine and
handsome; and which is more, her voice, for want of use, is so
Furr’d, that it doth not at present please me; but her manner of
singing is such, that I shall, I think, take great pleasure in it. Well,
680
she is come, and I wish us good fortune in her.
