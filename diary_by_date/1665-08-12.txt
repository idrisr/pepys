The people die so, that now it seems they are fain to carry the
dead to be buried by daylight, the nights not sufficing to do it in.
And my Lord Mayor commands people to be within at 9 at night,
all (as they say) that the sick may have liberty to go abroad for ayre.
There is one also dead out of one of our ships at Deptford, which
troubles us mightily — the Providence fireship, which was just fitted
to go to sea. But they tell me today,.no more sick on board. And
this day W. Bodham tells me that one is dead at Woolwich, not far
from the Ropeyard. I am told too, that a wife of one of the groomes
at Court is dead at Salsbury, so that the King and Queene are
speedily to be all gone to [Wilton]. God preserve us.
