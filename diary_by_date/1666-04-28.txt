I very busy all the afternon till night — among other things,
610
writing a letter to my brother John, the first I have done since my
being angry with him; and that so sharp a one too, that I was sorry
almost to send it when I had wrote it; but it is preparative to my
being kind to him, and sending for him up hither when he hath
passed his degree of Maister in Arts. So home to supper and to bed.
