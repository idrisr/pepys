I find Gosnell come, who my wife tells me is like to prove a
pretty companion, of which I am glad. So to my office for alittle
business and then home in the evening, to entertain myselfa little
with my wife and her — who sings exceeding well, and I shall take
great delight in her. And so merrily to bed.
