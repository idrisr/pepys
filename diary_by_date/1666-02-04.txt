Lords day. And my wife andI the first time together at church
since the plague, and now only because of Mr. Mills his coming
home to preach his first sermon, expecting a great excuse for his
leaving the parish before anybody went, and now staying till all are
come home; but he made but a very poor and short excuse, and a
bad sermon. It was a frost, and had snowed last night, which
covered the graves in the churchyard, so I was the less afeared for
going through. Here I had the content to see my noble Mrs.
Lethulier; and so home to dinner, and all the afternoon at my
Journall till supper, it being a long while behindhand. At supper my
wife tells me that W. Joyce hath been with her this evening, the first
time since the plague — and tells her my aunt James is lately dead of
the stone, and what she had hath given to his and his brother’s wife
and my cousin Sarah. So after supper to work again, and late to bed.
