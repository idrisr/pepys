Up, and to the office, where all the morning. And then home
and put a mouthful of victuals in my mouth; and by a hackney
coach fallowed my wife and girls, who are gone by 11 a-clock,
thinking to have seen a new play at the Duke of York’s House; but I
do find them staying at my tailor’s, the play not being today, and
990
therefore I now took them to Westminster Abbey and there did
show them all the tombs very finely, having one with us alone
(there being other company this day to see the tombs, it being
Shrove Tuesday); and here we did see, by perticular favour, the
body of Queen Katherine of Valois, and had her upper part of her
body in my hands. And] did kiss her mouth, reflecting upon it that I
did kiss a Queen, and that this was my birthday, 36 years old, that I
did first kiss a Queen. Thence to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and
there finding the play begun, we homeward to the glass-house and
there showed my cousins the making of glass, and had several
things made with great content; and among others, Ihad one or two
singing-glasses made, which make an echo to the voice, the first
that ever I saw; but so thin that the very breath broke one or two of
them. So home, and thence to Mr. Batelier’s, where we supped,
and had a good supper; and here was Mr. Gumbleton, and after
supper some fiddles and so to dance; but my eyes were so out of
order that I had little pleasure this night at all, though I was glad to
see the rest merry. And so about midnight home and to bed.
