I despatch many letters today abroad — and it was late before
we could get to bed. Mr. Sheply and How supped with me in my
Cabbin, and the boy Eliezr. flung down a can of beer upon my
papers which made me give him a box of the eare, it having all
spoiled my papers and cost me a great deal of work. So to bed.
