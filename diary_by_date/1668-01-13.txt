Up, and Mr. Gibbs comes to me and I give him instructions
about the writing fair my Tanger accounts against tomorrow. So I
abroad with Sir W. Penn to Whitehall, and there did with the rest
attend the Duke of York, where nothing extraordinary; only |
perceive there is nothing yet declared for the next year what fleet
shall be abroad. Thence homeward by coach and stopped at
Martins my bookseller, where I saw the French book whichI did
think to have had for my wife to translate, called L’escholle de Filles,
but when I came to look into it, it is the most bawdy, lewd book
that ever I saw, rather worse then putana errante — so that I was
ashamed of reading in it; and so away home, and there to the
Change to discourse with Sir H. Cholmly and so home to dinner;
and in the evening, having done some business, I with my wife and
girl out, and left them at Unthankes while I to Whitehall to the
Treasury chamber for an order for Tanger; and so back, took up my
wife, and home, and there busy about my Tanger accounts against
tomorrow, which I do get ready in good condition; and so with
great content to bed.
