After dinner I went to Greatorex’s, whom I found in his
garden and set him to work upon my Ruler, to ingrave an
Almanacke and other things upon the brasses of it — which alittle
before night he did, but the latter part he slubberd over, that I must
get him to do it over better or else I shall not fancy my Rule. Which
is such a folly that I am come to now, that whereas before my
delight was in multitude of books and spending money in that and
buying alway of other things, now that I am become a better
husband and have left off buying, now my delight is in the neatness
of everything, and so cannot be pleased with anything unless it be
very neat; which is a strange folly. Hither came W. Howe about
business; and he and I had a great deal of discourse about my Lord
Sandwich, andI find by him that my Lord doth dote upon one of
the daughters of Mrs. [Becke] where he lies, so that he spends his
time and money upon her. He tells me she is a woman of a very bad
fame and very impudent, and hath told my Lord so. Yet for all that,
my Lord doth spend all his evenings with her, though he be at
Court in the daytime —in fine, I perceive my Lord is dabling with
this wench, for which I am sorry; though I do not wonder at it,
being a man amorous enough and now begins to allow himself the
302
liberty that he sees everybody else at Court takes.
Ir. We met and sat at the office all the morning. And at noon, I to
the Change, where I met Dr. Pierce; who tells me that the King
comes to town this day from Tunbrige to stay a day or two, and
then fetch the Queen from thence — who he says is grown a very
debonnaire lady and now hugs him and meets him galloping upon
the road, and all the actions of a fond and pleasant lady that can be.
