Upandto the office, where we sat all the morning; and home to
dinner, and then to the office again, being pretty good friends with
my wife again, no angry words passing. In the evening comes Mr.
Reeves with a 12-foote glasse; and so I left the office and home,
where I met Mr. Batelier with my wife, in order to their going
tomorrow by agreement to Bow to see a dancing meeting. But
Lord, to see how soon I could conceive evil fears and thought
concerning them. So Reeves and | and they up to the top of the
house, and there we endeavoured to see the moon and Saturne and
Jupiter; but the heaven proved cloudy, and so we lost our labour,
having taken pains to get things together in order to the managing
of our long glass. So down to supper and then to bed, Reeves lying
at my house; but good discourse I had from him in his own trade
concerning glasses. And so all of us late to bed. I receive fresh
intelligence that Deptford and Greenwich are now afresh exceed-
ingly afflicted with the sickness, more then ever.
