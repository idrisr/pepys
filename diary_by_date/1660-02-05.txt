Lord’s day. In the morning before church time, Mr. Hawly,
who hath for this day or two looked something sadly, which
methought did speak something in his breast concerning me, came
to me, telling me that he was out 24/, which he could not tell what
was become of, and that he doth remember that he had such a sum
in a bag the other day, and could not tell what he did with it; at
which I was very sorry but could not help him. In the morning to
Mr. Guning, where a stranger, an old man, preached a good honest
sermon upon “What manner of love is this that we should be called
the sons of God.” After sermon I could not find my wife, who
promised to be at the gate against my coming out, and waited there
a great while; then went to my house and finding her gone, I
returned and called at the Chequer, thinking to dine at the ordinary
with Mr. Chetwind or Mr. Thomas; but they not being there, I
went to my father and found her there, and there I dined. To their
church in the afternoon, and in Mrs. Turners pew my wife took up
a good black hood and kept it. A stranger preached a poor sermon,
and so I read over the whole book of the story of Tobit. After
sermon, we to my father’s — where I writ some notes for my
Brother John to give to the Mercers tomorrow, it being the day of
their Apposition. After supper, home; and before going to bed, I
stood writing of this day its passages — while a drum came by,
beating of a strange manner of beat, now and then a single stroke;
which my wife and I wondered at, what the meaning of it should
be.
