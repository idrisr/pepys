Lay very long in bed with wife, it being very cold and my wife
very full ofa resolution to keep within doors, not so muchas to go
to church or see my Lady Sandwich before Easter next — which I am
willing enough to, though I seem the contrary. This and other talk
kept me a-bed till almost 10 a-clock. Then up and made an end of
looking over all my papers and books and taking everything out of
my chamber to have all made clean. At noon dined; and after
dinner, forth to several places to pay away money to clear myself in
all the world; and among other, paid my bookseller 61 for books I
had from him this day, and the silversmiths 22] 18s. ood. for
spoons, forks, and sugar box. And being well pleased with seeing
my business done to my mind, as to my meeting with people and
having my books ready for me—I home and to my office and there
did business late; and then home to supper, prayers, and to bed.
