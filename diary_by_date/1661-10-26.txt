In the evening news was brought that Sir R. Slingsby our
Comptroller (who hath this day been sick a week) is dead; which
put me into so great a trouble of mind, that all the night I could not
sleep, he being a man that loved me and had many Qualitys that
made me to love him above all the officers and Comissioners in the
Navy. Coming home, we called at Dan. Rawlinson’s and there
drank good sack; and so home.
