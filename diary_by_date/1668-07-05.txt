Lords day. About 4 in the morning took four pills of Dr.
Turberville’s prescribing for my eyes, and they wrought pretty
well most of the morning, and I did get my wife to spend the
morning reading of Wilkins’s Real Character. At noon comes W.
How and Pelling, and young Michell and his wife, and dined with
us. And most of the afternoon talking; and then at night, my wife to
read again and to supper and to bed.
