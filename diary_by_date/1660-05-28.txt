Called up at 2 in the morning for letters for my Lord from the
Duke of Yorke — but I went to bed again till 5. Trimmed early this
morning. This morning the Captain did call over all the men in the
ship (not the boys) and gave every one of them a Duckett of the
King’s money that he gave the ship — and the officers according to
their Quality. For my share, I received in the Captain’s Cabbin 60
Ducketts. The rest of the morning busy writing letters. Supped
with my Lord, and after that to bed. This night I had a strange
dream of bepissing myself, which I really did; and having kicked
the clothes off, I got cold and found myself all muck-wet in the
morning and had a great deal of pain in making water, which made
me very melancholy.
