Lords day. Allthe morning at my office doing business there, it
raining hard. So dined at home alone. After dinner walked to my
Lord’s — and there found him and much other guest[s] at table at
dinner, and it seems they have christened his young son today,
called him James; I gota piece of cake. Igot my Lord to sign and seal
my business about my selling of Brampton land; which though not
so full as I would, yet is as full as I can at present. Walked home
again, and there fell to read; and by and by comes my Uncle Wight,
Dr. Burnett and another gentleman, and talked and drank — and the
Doctor showed me the manner of eating Turpentine; which pleases
me well, for itis with great ease. So they being gone, Ito supper and
tobed.
