Up, and to the office and there comes Lead to me; and at last my
vizards are done, and glasses got to put in and out as I will; and I
think I have brought it to the utmost, both for easiness of using and
benefit, that I can; and so I paid him 15s. for what he hath done now
last in the finishing them, and they, Ihope, willdo mea great deal of
ease. At the office all the morning; and this day the first time did
alter my side of the table, after above eight years sitting on that next
the fire. But now I am not able to bear the light of the windows in
my eyes, I do go there; and I did sit with much more content then I
had done on the other side for a great while, and in winter the fire
will not trouble my back. At noon home to dinner; and after dinner,
all the afternoon within with Mr. Hater, Gibson, and W. Hewer,
reading over and drawing up new things in the instructions of
commanders; which will be good, and I hope to get them
IOI7
confirmed by the Duke of York, though I perceive nothing will
effectually perfect them but to look over the whole body of the
instructions of all the officers of a ship, and make them all perfect
together. This being done, comes my bookseller and brings me
home, bound, my collection of papers about my Addresse to the
Duke of York in August; which makes me glad, it being that which
shall do me more right many years hence then perhaps all I ever did
in my life — and therefore I do, both for my own and the King’s
sake, value it much. By and by also comes Browne the Mathemati-
cal-instrument maker, and brings me home my instrument for
Perspective, made according to the description of Dr. Wren’s in the
late Transactions, and he hath made it, I think, very well; and that
that I believe will do the thing, and therein give me great content,
but that I fear all the contents that must be received by my eyes are
almost lost. So to the office and there late at business, and then
home to supper and to bed.
