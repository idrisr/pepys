At 2 a-clock, with very great mirth, we went to our lodging
and to bed. And lay till 7; and then called up by Sir W. Batten—soI
rise. And we did some business; and at about 9 a-clock, after we had
breakfasted, we Sett forth for London; and endeed, I wasalittle
troubled to part with Mrs. Rebecca — for which God forgive me.
But of all the journys that ever I made, this was the merriest, and I
was in a strange moode for mirth. I met two little schooleboys,
going with pichers of ale to their schoolmaster to break up against
Easter; and IJdid drink of some of one of them and give him two
pence. By and by we came to two little girls keeping cowes; and I
saw one of them very pretty, so had a minde to make her aske my
blessing. And telling that I was her godfather, she asked me
innocently whether I was not Ned Wooding, andI said that I was;
so she kneeled down and very simply cried, “Pray, godfather, pray
to God to bless me” — which made us very merry and I gave her
twopence. In several places I asked women whether they would
Sell me their children; that they denied me all, but said they would
give me one to keep for them if I would.
