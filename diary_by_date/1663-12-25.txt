Christmas. Lay long, talking pleasantly with my wife; but
among other things, she begin, I know not whether by design or
chance, to enquire what she should do ifI should by an accident die;
to whichI did give her some slight answer, but shall make good use
of it to bring myself to some settlement for her sake, by making a
Will as soon as I can. Up, and to church, where Mr. Mills made an
ordinary sermon; and so home and dined with great pleasure with
my wife; and all the afternoon, first looking out at window and
seeing the boys playing at many several sports in our back-yard by
334
Sir W. Pens, which minded me of my own former times; and then I
begin to read to my wife upon the globes, with great pleasure and to
good purpose, for it will be pleasant to her and to me to have her
understand those things. In the evening to the office, where I stayed
late reading Rushworth, which is a most excellent collection of the
beginning of the late quarrels in this kingdom. And so home to
supper and to bed with good content of mind.
