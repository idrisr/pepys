Myfather and sister very betimes took their leave; and my
wife, with all possible kindness, went with them to the Coach —I
being mightily pleased with their company thus long, and my
father with his being here; and it rejoices my heart that I am in
condition to do anything to comfort him, and could, were it not for
my mother, have been contented he should have stayed alway here
with me — he is such innocent company. In the evening down to
Tower wharfe, thinking to go by water; but could not get
watermen, they being now so scarce by reason of the great press. So
to the Custome house; and there with great threats got a couple to
carry me down to Deptford, all the way reading Pompey the Great (a
play translated from French by several noble persons; among other,
my Lord Buckehurst); but to me is but a mean play, and the words
and sense not very extraordinary. From Deptford I walked to
Redriffe, and was in my way overtaken by Bagwell, lately come
from sea in the Providence; who did give me an account of several
perticulars in the late fight, and how his ship was deserted basely by
the Yorke, Capt. Swanly, commander. So I home; and there, after
writing my letters, home to supper and to bed — fully resolved to
rise betimes and go down the River tomorrow morning, being
vexed this night to find none of the officers in the yard at 7 at night,
nor anybody concerned, as if it were a Dutch warr.
