Lords day. The like all this morning and afternoon, and
finished it to my mind. So about 4 a-clock walked to the Temple,
and there by coach to St. James’s and met, to my wish, the Duke of
York and Mr. Wren; and understand the Duke of York hath
received answers from Brouncker, W. Penn and
J. Mennes; and as
soon as he saw me, he bid Mr. Wren read them over with me. So
having no opportunity of talk with the Duke of York, and Mr.
944
Wren some business to do, he puts them into my hand like an idle
companion, to take home with me before himself had read them;
which doth give me great opportunity of altering my answer, if
there was cause. So took a hackney and home; and after supper
made my wife to read them all over, wherein she is mighty useful to
me. And I
find them all evasions, and in many things false, and in
few to the full purpose. Little said reflective on me, though W. Penn
and
J.Mennes do mean me in one or two places, and
J.Mennes a
little more plainly would lead the Duke of York to question the
exactness of my keeping my records — but all to no purpose. My
mind is mightily pleased by this, ifIcan but get them to have a copy
taken of them for my future use; but Imust return them tomorrow.
So to bed.
