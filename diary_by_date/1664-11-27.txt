Lords day. To church in the morning. Then dined at home,
and to my office and there all the afternoon setting right my
business of Flaggs; and after all my pains, find reason not to be
sorry, because I think it will bring me considerable profit. In the
evening came Mr. Andrews and Hill, and we sung with my boy
Ravenscrofts four-part psalms, most admirable music. Then
(Andrews not staying) we to supper; and after supper fell into the
rarest discourse with Mr. Hill about Rome and Italy, the most
pleasant that I ever had in my life. At it very late, and then to bed.
