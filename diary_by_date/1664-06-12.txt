Lords day. All the morning in my chamber, consulting my
lesson of shipbuilding. And at noon Mr. Creed by appointment
came and dined with us and sat talking all the afternoon, till about
church time my wife and I begin our great dispute about going to
Griffins child’s christening, where Iwas to have been godfather; but
Sir
J.Mennes refusing, he wanted an equal for me and my Lady
Batten and so sought for others. Then the question was whether my

wife should go; and she having dressed herself on purpose, was very
angry and begin to talk openly of my keeping her within doors
before Creed; which vexed me to the guts, but Ihad the discretion to
keep myself without passion; and so resolved at last not to go, but to
go down by water. Which we did, by H. Russell, to the Halfway
house and there eat and drank; and upon a
very small occasion had a
difference again broke out, where without any the least cause she
had the cunning to cry a great while and talk and blubber; which
made me mighty angry in mind but said nothing to provoke her,
because Creed was there. But walked home, being troubled in my
mind also about the knavery and neglect of Capt. Fudge and Taylor,
who were to have had their ship for Tanger ready by Thursday last,
and now'the men by a mistake are come on board, and not any
Maister or man or boy of the ship’s company on board with them
when we came by her side this afternoon. And also, I received a
letter from Mr. Coventry this day in complaint of it.
