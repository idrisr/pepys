Up earely this morning; and my people are taking down the
206
hangings and things in my house because of the great dust that is
already made by the pulling down of Sir W. Batten’s house, and
will be by my own when I come to it. To my office, and there hard
at work all the morning. After a little dinner, to my office again.
And in the evening Sir W. Warren came to me about business; and
that being done, discoursing of Deales, I did offer to go along with
him among his deal ships; which we did, to half a scoare; where he
showed me the difference between Dram, Swinsound, Christiana
and others, and told me many pleasant notions concerning their
manner of cutting and sawing them by watermills, and the reason
how deals become dearer and cheaper; among others, when the
snow is not so great as to fill up the vallys, that they pass from hill to
hill over the snow, then it is dear carriage. From on board he took
me to his yard, where vast and many piles of deals, sparres, and
balkes and Euphroes — the difference between which I never knew
before. And endeed, am very proud of this evening’s work. He had
me into his house, which is most pretty and neat and well furnished.
After a glass, not of wine, for I could not be tempted to drink any,
but a glass of mum, I well home by water; but it being late, was
forced to land at the custome house, and so home~and to bed. And
after I was abed, letters came from the Duke for the fitting out of
four ships forthwith from Portsmouth (Iknow not yet for what), so
Iwas forced to make Will get them writ, and signed them in bed and
sent them away by expresse. And so to sleep.
