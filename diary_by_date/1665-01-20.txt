Tothe Swanat noon, and there sent fora bit of meat and dined
and had my baiser of the fille of the house there — but nothing plus.
So took coach and to my Lady Sandwiches; and so to my
booksellers and there took home Hookes book of Microscopy, a
most excellent piece, and of which I am very proud. So home, and
by and by again abroad with my wife about several businesses; and
met at the New Exchange, and there to our trouble find our pretty
Doll is gone away to live, they say with her father in the country —
but I doubt something worse. So homeward, in my way buying a
hare and taking it home — which arose upon my discourse today
463
with Mr. Batten in Westminster hall - who showed me my
mistake, that my hares-foot’ hath not the joyne to it, and assures
me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him. And it is
a strange thing how fancy works, for Ino sooner almost handled his
foot but my belly begin to be loose and to break wind; and whereas I
was in some pain yesterday and t’other day, and in fear of more
today, I became very well, and so continue. At home to my office a
while, and so to supper — read, and to cards and to bed.
