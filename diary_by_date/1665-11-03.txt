Was called up about 4 a-clock, and in the dark by lanthorn took
boat, and to the ketch and set sail — sleepingalittle in the Cabbin till
day; and then up, and fell to reading of Mr. Eveling’s book about
Paynting, which isa very pretty book. Carrying good victuals, and
Tom with me, I to breakfast about 9 a-clock, and then to read again,
and came to the fleet about 12 — where found my Lord (the Prince
being gone in) on board the Royall James, Sir Tho. Allen
commander; and with my Lord an hour alone, discoursing, which
$49
was my chief and only errand, about what was advisable for his
Lordshipp to do in this state of things, himself being under the
Duke of York and Mr. Coventrys envy and a great many more —
and likely never to do anything honourably but he shall be envied,
and the honour taken as much as can be from it. His absence
lessens his interest at Court — and which is worst, we never able to
set out a fleet fit for him to command; or if out, to keep them out,
or fit them to do any great thing; or if that were so, yet nobody at
home minds him or his condition when he is abroad; and lastly,
the whole affairs of state looking as if they would all on a sudden
break in pieces, and then what a sad thing it would be for him to
be out of the way. We after this talked of some other little things,
and so to dinner, where my Lord infinitely kind to me; and after
dinner I rose and left him with some Commanders at the table,
taking tobacco; and I took the Bezan back with me, and with a
brave gale and tide reached up that night to the Hope, taking great
pleasure in learning the seamen’s manner of singing when they
sound the depths. And then to supper and to sleep, which I did
most excellently all night, it being a horrible foul night for wind
and rain.
