Up, and by coach to Sir Ph. Warwickes, the street being full of
footballs, it being a great frost. And find him and Mr. Coventry
walking in St. James park. I did my errand to him about the felling
of the King’s timber in the forests, and then to my Lord of Oxford,
Justice in Eyre, for his consent thereto, for want whereof my Lord
Privy Seale stops the whole business. Ifound him in his lodgings, in
but an ordinary furnished house and room where he was, but I find
him to be a man of good discreet replies. Thence to the Coffee-
house, where certain news that the Dutch have taken some of our
Colliers to the north—some say four, some say seven. Thence to the
Change a while, and so home to dinner and to the office, where we
sat late, and thenI to write my letters. Then to Sir W. Batten’s, who
is going out of town to Harwich tomorrow, to set up a Lighthouse
there which he hath lately got a patent from the King to set up, that
will turn much to his profit. Here very merry, and so to my office
again, where very late, and then home to supper and to bed — but sat
up with my wife at cards till past 2 in the morning.
