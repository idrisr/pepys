Comes Sir Jo. Bankes to see me, and tell me that coming up
from Rochester, he overtook above 3 or 400 seamen, and he be-
lieves every day they come flocking from the fleet in like numbers;
which is a sad neglect there, when it will be impossible to get others
and we have little reason to think these will return presently again.
