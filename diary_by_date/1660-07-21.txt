Tomy Lord and spoke to him about the business of the Privy
Seale for me to be sworn. Went to the Six Clerks’ Office to Mr.
Spong for the writings, and dined with him at a club at the next
door, where we had three voices to sing catches. So to my house to
write letters and so to Whitehall about business of my Lord’s
concerning his creation, and so home and to bed.
