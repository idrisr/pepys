The Comissioners for Tanger met, and there my Lord
Tiviott, together with Capt. Cuttance, Capt. Evans, and Jonas
Moore, sent to that purpose, did bring us a brave draught of the
Molle to be built there, and report that it is likely to be the most
considerable place the King of England hath in the world; and so I
am apt to think it will. After discourse of this and of supplying the
Guarrison with some more horse, we rise; and Sir
J.Mennes and I
home again, finding the street about our house full, Sir R. Ford
beginning his Shrevalty today. And what with his and our houses
being new-painted, the street begins to look a great deal better then
it did — and more gracefull.
