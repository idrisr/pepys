Up by 5 a-clock — and put things in my house in order, to be
laid up against my workmen come on Monday to take down the
top of my house — which trouble I must go through now, but it
troubles me much to think of it. So to my office — where till noon
we sat; and thenI to dinner and to the office all the afternoon, with
much business. At night with Cooper at Arithmetique; and then
came Mr. Creede about my Lord’s accounts, to even them; and he
gone, I to supper and to bed.
