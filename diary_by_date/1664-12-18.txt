Lords day. To church; where God forgive me, I spent most of
my time in looking my new Morena at the other side of the church,
an acquaintance of Pegg Pen’s. So home to dinner and then to my
chamber to read Ben. Johnsons Cateline, a very excellent piece. And
so to church again; and thence we met at the office to hire ships,
being in great haste and having sent for several maisters of Shipps to
come to us. Then home, and there Mr. Andrews and Hill came and
we sung finely. And by and by, Mr. Fuller the parson, and supped
with me, he andafriend of his; but my music friends would not stay
supper. At and after supper, Mr. Fuller and I [told] many stories of
apparitions and delusions thereby. He gone, Ia
little to my office
and then to prayers and to bed.
