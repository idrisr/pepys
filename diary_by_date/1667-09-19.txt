Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon home to
dinner, W. Hewer and I and my wife, when comes my Cosen Kate
Joyce and an aunt of ours, Lettice, formerly Hanes and now
Howlett, come to town to see her friends, and also Sarah Kite, with
her little boy in her armes, a very pretty little boy. The childI like
very well, and could wish it my own. My wife, being all unready,
did not appear. I made as much of them as I could such ordinary
company; and yet my heart was glad to see them, though their
condition was alittle below my present state to be familiar with.
She tells me how the Lifeguard, which we thought a little while
since was sent down into the country about some insurrection, was
sent to Winchcombe to spoil the Tobacco there, which it seems the
people there do plant contrary to law and have always done, and
still been under force and danger of having it spoiled; as it hath been
oftentimes, and yet they will continue to plant it. The place, she
says, is a miserable poor place. They gone, I to the office, where all
the afternoon very busy; and at night, when my Eyes were weary of
the light, I and my wife to walk in the garden, and then home to
supper and pipe and then to bed.
