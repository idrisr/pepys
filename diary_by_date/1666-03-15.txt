Lay tillit was full time to rise, it being 8 a-clock, and so to the
office and there sat till almost 3 a-clock, and then to dinner; and after
dinner (my wife and Mercer and Mrs. Barbary being gone to
Hales’s before), and my Cosen Anth. Joyce, who came on purpose
to dinner with me. And he andI to discourse of our proposition of
marriage between Pall and Harman. And upon discourse, he and I
to Harman’s house, and took him to a tavern hard by and we to
discourse of our business, and I offered so0o/. And he declares most
ingenuously that his trade is not to be trusted on — that he however

needs no money, but would have her money bestowed on her —
which I like well, he saying that he would adventure 2 or 300! with
her. I like him as a most good-natured and discreet man, and |
believe very cunning.* We came to this conclusion, for us to meet
one another the next week, and then we hope to come to some end,
for I did declare myself well satisfied with the mach. Thence to
Hales, where I met my wife and people, and do find the picture,
above all things, a most pretty picture and mighty like my wife —
and Iasked him his price: he says 141; and the truth is, Ithink he doth
deserve it. Thence toward London and home, and I to the office,
where I did much, and betimes to bed, having had of late so little
sleep, and there slept till 7 this morning.
