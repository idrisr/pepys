Inthe evening, my wife beinga
little impatient, I went along
with her to buy her a necklace of pearle which will cost 4l 10s. —
which I am willing to comply with her in, for her incouragement
and because I have lately got money, having now above 200! in
Cash beforehand in the world. Home; and having in our way
bought a rabbett and two little lobsters, my wife and I did supp late;
and so to bed. Great newes nowaday of the Duc D’ Anjou’s desire to
marry the Princesse Henriette. Hugh Peters is said to be taken. And
the Duke of Glocester is fallen ill and is said will prove the smallpox.
