Sir H. Cholmly came to me this day, and tells me the Court is
as mad as ever and that the night the Duch burned our ships, the
King did sup with my Lady Castlemayne at the Duchess of
Monmouth, and there were all mad in hunting of a poor moth. All
the Court afeared of a Parliament; but he thinks nothing can save us
but the King’s giving up all to a Parliament.
