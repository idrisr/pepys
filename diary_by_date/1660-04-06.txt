This morning came my brother-in-law Balty to see me and to
33
desire to be here with me as Reformado, which did much trouble
me. But after dinner (my Lord using him very civilly at table), I
spoke to my Lord and he promised me a letter to Capt. Stokes for
him, that he should be there. All the day with him, walking and
talking; we under sail as far as the Spitts. In the afternoon, W. How
and I to our Viallins, the first time since we came on board. In the
evening, it being fine moonshine, | stayed late, walking upon the
Quarter-deck talking with Mr. Cuttance, learning of some sea
terms; and so down to supper and to bed — having an hour before
put Balty into Bur’s cabin, he being out of the ship.
