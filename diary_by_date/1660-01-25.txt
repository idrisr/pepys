Called up early to Mr. Downing; he gave me a Character,*
such a one as my Lord’s, to make perfect. And likewise gave me his
order for sool: to carry to Mr. Frost; which.I did, and so to my
office. Where I did do something about the character till 12 a-clock.
Then home and found my wife and the maid at my Lord’s, getting
things ready against tomorrow.
