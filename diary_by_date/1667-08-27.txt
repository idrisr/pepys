This day Mr. Pierce the surgeon was with me; and tells me
how this business of my Lord Chancellors was certainly designed in
my Lady Castlemaine’s chamber, and that when he went from the
King on Monday morning, she was in bed (though about 12 a-
clock) and ran out in her smock into her Aviary looking into
Whitehall garden, and thither her woman brought her her night-
gown, andstood joying herself at the old man’s going away. And
several of the gallants of Whitehall (of which there was many
staying to see the Chancellor return) did talk to her in her Bird cage;
among others, Blanckford, telling her she was the Bird of paradise.
