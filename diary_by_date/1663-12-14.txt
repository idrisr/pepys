W. Howe tells me that my Lord, it is true, fora while after my
letter was displeased, and did show many slightings of me when he
had occasion of mentioning me to his Lordshipp, but that now my
Lord is in good temper, and he doth believe will show me as much
respect as ever — and would have me not to refrain to come to him.
This news, I confess, did much trouble me; but whenI did hear how
he is come to himself and hath wholly left Chelsy and that slut, and
that I see he doth fallow his business and becomes in better repute
then before, I am rejoiced to see it, though it doth cost me some
disfavour for a time; for if not his good nature and ingenuity, yet I
believe his memory will not bear it alway in his mind. But it is my
comfort that this is the thing, after so many years good service, that
hath made him my enemy.
