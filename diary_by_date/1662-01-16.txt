Atnight to Sir W. Batten and there saw him and Capt. Cock
and Stokes play at Cards, and afterwards supped with them. Stokes
told us that notwithstanding the country of Gambo is so unhealthy,
yet the people of that place live very long, so as the present King
there is 150 years old, which they count by Raynes because every
year it rains continually four months together. He also told us that
the kings there have above 100 wives apiece, and offered him the
choice of any of his wifes to lie with, and so he did Capt. Holmes.
So home and to bed.
