Up betimes as I use to do, and in my chambers begun to look
over my father’s accounts, which he brought out of the country
with him by my desire, whereby I may see what he hath received
and spent. AndIfind that he is not anything extravagant, and yet it
doth so far outdo his estate that he must either think of lessening his
charge or I must be forced to spare money out of my purse to help
him through; which I would willing do, as far as 2ol goes.
Somewhat troubled at Ashwell’s desiring and insisting over-
eaguerly upon her going to a ball to meet some of her old
companions at a dancing school here in town next Friday; but lam
resolved she shall not go.
