This my Birth day, 28 yeeres. This morning Sir W. Batten,
Pen, and I did some business. Then after dinner by water to
Whitefryers to the playhouse, and there saw The Changeling, the
first time it hath been acted these 20 yeeres — and it takes
exceedingly. Besides, I see the gallants do begin to be tyred with the
Vanity and pride of the Theatre actors, who are endeed grown very
proud and rich. Then by linke home — and there to my book awhile
and to bed. I met today with Mr. Townsend, who tells me that the
old man is yet alive in whose place in the Wardrobe he hopes to get
my father — which I do resolve to put for. I also met with the
Comptroller, who told me how it was easy for us all, the principall
officers, and proper for us, to labour to get into the next parliament
120
— and would have me to aske the Dukes letter.! But I shall not
endeavour it — because it will spend much money, though I am sure
I could well obtaine it. This is now 28 years that I am born. And
blessed be God, andastate of full content and great hopes to be a
happy man in all respects, both to myself and friends.
