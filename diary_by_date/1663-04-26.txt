Lords day. All the afternoon upon my accounts, and find
myself worth full 70ol, for which I bless God, it being the most I
was ever yet worth in money. In the evening (my father being gone
to my brother’s to lie tonight) my wife, Ashwell, and the boy and],
and the dog, over the water and walked to Halfway house and
beyond, into the fields gathering of Cowslipps; and so to Halfway
house with some cold lamb we carried with us, and there supped;
and had a most pleasant walk back again — Ashwell all along telling
us some parts of their maske at Chelsy school, which was very
pretty; andI find she hath a most prodigious memory, remember-
ing so much of things acted six or seven years ago. So home; and
after reading my vowes, being sleepy, without prayers to bed; for
which God forgive me.
