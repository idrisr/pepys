Inthe morning to the paynters about my little picture. Thence
to Toms about business; and so to the pewterers to buy a poore’s
box to put my forfeites in, upon breach of my late vowes. So to the
Wardrobe and dined, and thence home and to my office and there
sat looking over my papers of my voyage when we fetched over the
King, and tore so many of those that were worth nothing, as filled
my closet as high as my knees. Istayed doing this till 10 at night; and
so home and to bed.
