Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the
Change and there almost made my bargain about a ship for Tanger,
which will bring me ina little profit with Capt. Taylor. Off the
Change with Mr Cutler and Sir W. Rider to Cutlers house; and
there had a very good dinner, and two or three pretty young ladies
of their relations there. Thence to my Case-maker for my Stone
case; and had it to my mind, and cost me 24s. — which is a great deal
of money, but it is well done and pleases me. So doing some other
small errands, I home and there find my boy Tom Edwards come —
sent me by Capt. Cooke, having [been] bred in the King’s chapel
these four years. Ipurpose to make a clerk of him; and ifhe deserves
well, to do well by him. Spent much of the afternoon to set his
chamber in order; and then to the office, leaving him at home. And
late at night, after all business was done, I called Will and told him
my reason of taking a boy, and that it is of necessity, not out of any
unkindness to him, nor should be to his injury. And then talked
about his landlord’s daughter* to come to my wife, and I think it
will be. So home and find my boy a very schooleboy that talks
inocently and impertinently; but at present itis a sport to us, and ina
little time he will leave it. So sent him to bed, he saying that he used
to go to bed at 8 a-clock. And then all of us to bed, myself pretty
well pleased with my choice of a boy. All the news this day is that
the Dutch are with 22 sail of ships of warr crewsing up and down
about Ostend; at which we are alarmed. My Lord Sandwich is
come back into the Downes with only eight sail, which is or may be
a prey to the Dutch, if they knew our weakness and inability to set
out any more speedily.
