This morning comes one with a vessel of Northdowne ale
from Mr. Pierce the purser to me. And after him, another with a
brave Turkey carpet and a Jarre of Olives from Capt. Cuttance and
a pair of fine Turtle-doves from John Burr to my wife. These things
came up today in our smack; and my boy Ely came along with them
and came after office was done to see me. I did give him half a
crowne because I saw that he was ready to cry to see that he could
not be entertained by me here. In the afternoon to the Privy Seale,
where good stir of work now toward the end of the month. From
thence with Mr. Mount, Luellin and others to the Bullhead till late,
and so home. Where about 10 a-clock Maj. Hart came to me —
whomI did receive with wine and a dish of Anchoves, which made
me so dry that I was ill with them all night and was fain to have the
girl rise to fetch me some drink.
