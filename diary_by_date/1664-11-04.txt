Waked very betimes and lay long awake, my mind being so full
of business. Then up and to St. James, where I find Mr. Coventry
full of business, packing up for his going to sea with the Duke.
Walked with him, talking, to Whitehall; where to the Duke’s
lodgings, who is gone thither to lodge lately. I appeared to the
Duke; and thence Mr. Coventry and I an hour in the long gallery,
talking about the management of our office. He tells me the weight
of despatch will lie most upon me. And told me freely his mind
touching Sir W. Batten and Sir
J.Mennes — the latter of whom, he
most aptly said, was like a lapwing; that all he did was to keep a
flutter, to keep others from the nest that they would find. He told
me an odd story of the former, about the Lighthouses: how just
before, he had certified to the Duke against the use of them, and
what a burden they are to trade —and presently after, at his being at
Harwich, comes to desire that he might have the setting one up
there — and gets the usefulness of it certified also by the Trinity
house. After long discoursing and considering all our stores and
other things — as, how the King hath resolved upon Capt. Taylor
and Coll. Middleton, the first to be commissioner for Harwich and
the latter for Portsmouth —I away to the Change and there did very
much business. So home to dinner, and Mr. Duke, our Secretary
for the Fishery, dined with me. After dinner, to discourse of our
business — much to my content. And then he away and I by water
among the smiths on the other side; and to the alehouse with one
and was near buying four or five anchors, and learned something
worth my knowing of them. And so home and to my office, where
late, with my head very full of business; and so away home to
supper and to bed.
