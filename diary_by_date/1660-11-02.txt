office. In the afternoon I went to Whitehall, where when I came
I saw the boats going very thick to Lambeth and all the stairs to be
full of people: I was told the Queene was a-coming, soI gota sculler
for sixpence to carry me thither and back again; but I could not get
to see the Queen. So came back and to my Lord’s, where he was
come and I Supt with him, he being very merry, telling merry
stories of the country Mayors how they entertained the King all the
way as he came along and how the country gentlewomen did hold
up their heads to be kissed by the King, not taking his hand to kiss as
they should do. I observed this night very few bonfires in the City,
not above three in all London for the Queenes coming; whereby I
guess that (as I believed before) her coming doth please but very
few.
