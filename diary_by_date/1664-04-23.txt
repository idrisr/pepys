Coronacion day. Up; and after doing something at my office,
and it being a holiday, no sitting likely to be, I down by water to Sir
W. Warren’s, who hath been ill, and there talked long with him;
good discourse, especially about Sir W. Batten’s knaveries and his
son Castle[’s] ill language of me behind my back, saying that I
favour my fellow Traytours—but Ishall be even with him. So home
and to the Change, where I met with Mr. Coventry — who himself
is now full of talk of a Dutch war, for it seems the Lords have
concurred in the Commons’ vote about it and so the next week it
will be presented to the King. Insomuch that he doth desire we
would look about to see what stores we lack, and buy what we can.
Home to dinner, where I and my wife much troubled about my
money that is in my Lord Sandwiches hand, for fear of his going to
sea and be killed. But I will get what of it out I can. All the
afternoon, not being well, at my office and there did much
business, my thoughts still running upon a warr and my money. At
night home to supper and to bed.
