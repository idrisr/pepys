Lords day. | went to cast up my monthly accounts; and to my
great trouble, Ifind myself 7/ worse then I was the last month, but I
confess it is by my reckoning beforehand a great many things; yet
however, I am troubled to see that I can hardly promise myself to
lay up much from month’s end to month’s end, about 4 or s/ at
most, one month with another, without some extraordinary
gettings. But I must and I hope shall continue to have a care of my
own expenses. So to the reading my vowes seriously, and then to
supper. This evening there came my boy’s Brother to see for him;
and tells me he knows not where he is, himself being out of towne
this week, and is very sorry that he is gone; and so am I, but he shall
come no more. So to prayers and to bed.
