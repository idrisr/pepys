Lords day. Up, and dressed myself and so walked out with the
boy to Smithfield to Cow lane to Lincolnes, and there spoke with
him and agree upon the hour tomorrow to set out toward
Brampton; but vexed that he is not likely to go himself, but sends
another for him. Here I took a hackney coach, and to Whitehall and
there met Sir W. Coventry and discoursed with him; and then with
my Lord Brouncker and many others to end my matters, in order to
my going into the country tomorrow for five or six days, which I
have not been for now above three years.
