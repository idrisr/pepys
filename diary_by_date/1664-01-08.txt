Up and all the morning at my office and with Sir J. Mennes,
directing him and Mr. Turner about keeping of their books
according to yesterday’s work — wherein I shall make them work
enough. At noon to the Change and there long; and from thence by
appointment took Luellin, Mount, and W. Symons and Mr. Pierce
the surgeon home to dinner with me, and were merry. But Lord, to
hear how W. Symons doth commend [her] and look sadly, and then
talk bawdily and merrily, though his wife was dead but the other

afternoon, among other things, to talk of our old passages together
in Cromwells time. And how W. Symons did make me laugh and

coming in. Upon the Change, a great talk there was one Mr. Tryan,

and maid being gone out after he was a-bed) and gagged and robbed
of roso/ in money and about 4000! in Jewells which he had in the
house as security for money. It is believed that his man, by many
circumstances, is guilty of confederacy, by their ready going to his
secret Till in his desk wherein the key of his cash chest lay.
