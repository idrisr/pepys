becomes me most nobly as my wife says. At the office all day. At
noon put on my first laced band, all lace, and to Kate Joyce’s to
dinner; where my mother, wife, and abundance of their friends,
and good usage. Thence wife and Mercer and Ito the Old Exchange
and there bought two lace bands more, one of my Semstresse,
whom my wife concurs with me to bea pretty woman. So down to
Deptford and Woolwich, my boy and I. At Woolwich discoursed
with Mr. Shelden about my bringing my wife down for a month or
two to his house; which he approves of, and I think will be very
convenient. So late back and to the office, wrote letters, and so
home to supper and to bed. This day the Newsbook (upon Mr
Moores showing Lestrange Capt. Ferrers letter) did do my Lord
Sandwich great right as to the late victory. The Duke of Yorke not
yet come to town.
The town grows very sickly, and people to be afeared of it— there
dying this last week of the plague 112, from 43 the week before —
whereof, one in Fanchurch street and one in Broadstreete by the
Treasurer’s office.
