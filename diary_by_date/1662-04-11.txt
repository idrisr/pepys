Upearly to my lute and a song. Then about 6 a-clock with Sir
W. Pen by water to Deptford and among the ships now going to
Portugall with men and horse, to see them dispatched. So to
Greenwich; and had a fine pleasant walk to Woolwich, having in
our company Capt. Minnes, with whom, I was much pleased to
hear him talk, in fine language but pretty well for all that. Among
other things, he and the other Captains that were with us tell me
that Negros drownded look white and lose their blacknesse— which

I never heard before. At Woolwich, up and down to do the same
business and so back to Greenwich by water; and there, while
something is dressing for our dinner, Sir Wm. and
I walked into the
Parke, where the King hath planted trees and made steps in the hill
up to the Castle, which is very magnificent. So to dinner at the
Globe, and Capt. Lambert of the Dukes pleasure-boat came to us
and dined with us. And were merry and so home. AndI in the
evening to the Exchange and spoke with Uncle Wight; and so home
and walked with my wife on the leads late; and so the barber came
to me; and so to bed very weary, which I seldom am.
