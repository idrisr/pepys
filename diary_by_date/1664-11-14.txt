Up, and with Sir W. Batten to Whitehall to the Lords of the
Admiralty and there did our business betimes. Thence to Sir Ph.
Warwicke about Navy business — and my Lord Ashly; and
afterward to my Lord Chancellor, who is very well pleased with me
and my carrying of his business. And so to the Change, where
mighty busy; and so home to dinner, where Mr. Creed and Moore;
and after dinner I to my Lord Treasurers, to Sir Ph. Warwicke
there, and then to Whitehall to the Duke of Albimarle about
Tanger; and then homeward to the Coffee-house to hear news: and
it seems the Dutch, as I afterward find by Mr. Coventrys letters,
have stopped a ship of masts of Sir W. Warrens, coming for us in a
Swedes ship; which they will not release upon Sir G. Downings
claiming her — which appears as the first act of hostility — and is
looked upon as so by Mr. Coventry.
