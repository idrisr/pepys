Up, and to the office betimes, and there all the morning — very
busy to get out the fleet, the Dutch being now for certain out, and
we shall not, we think, be much behindhand with them. At noon to
the Change about business, and so home to dinner, and after dinner
to the setting my Journall to rights; and so to the office again —
where all the afternoon full of business, and there till night, that my
eyes were sore, that I could not write no longer. Then into the
garden; then my wife and Mercer, and my Lady Pen and her
daughter with us. And here we sang in the dark very finely half an
hour, and so home to supper and to bed. This afternoon, after a
long drowth, we had a good shoure of rain, but it will not signify
much ifno more come. This day, in the morning came Mr. Chichly
to Sir W»Coventry to tell him the ill-successe of the guns made for
the Loyall London; which is, that in the trial, every one of the great
guns, the whole Cannon of seven (as I take it), broke to pieces —
which is a strange mishap, and that which will give more occasion
to people’s discourse of the King’s business being done ill.
