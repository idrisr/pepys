Up, and with Sir W. Batten and J. Mennes to St. James’s,
where the first time I have been there since the enemy’s being with
us. Where little business but lack of money, which now is so
professed by Sir W. Coventry as nothing is more, and theKing’s
whole business owned to be at a stand for want of it. So up to my
Lord Chancellors, where was a Committee of Tanger in my Lord’s
Roome where he is to hear causes, where all the Judges’ pictures
hang up very fine. Here I read my letter to them, which was well
received and they did fall seriously to discourse the want of money
and other perticulars, and to some pretty good purpose. But to see
how Sir W. Coventry did oppose both my Lord Chancellor and the
Duke of York himself, about the order of the Commissioners of the
Treasury to me for not paying of Pensions, and with so much
reason and eloquence, so natural, was admirable — and another
thing, about his pressing for the reduction of the charge of Tanger,
which they would have put off to another time; “But,” says [he],
“the King suffers so much by the putting off of the consideration of
reductions of charge, that he is undone; and therefore I do pray you,
Sir,”’ (to his Royal Highness) “that when anything offers of that
kind, you will not let it scape you.” I perceive they do all profess
their expectation of a peace, and that suddenly; and do advise of
things accordingly — and do all speak of it (and expressly I
remember the Duke of Albemarle) saying that they hoped for it.
