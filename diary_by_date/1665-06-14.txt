I met with Mr. Cowling, who observed to me how he finds
everybody silent in the praise of my Lord of Sandwich, to set up the
Duke and the Prince. But that the Duke did, both to the King and
my Lord Chancellor, write abundantly of my Lord’s courage and
service. And I this day met witha
letter of Capt. Ferrers, where he
tells us my Lord was with his ship in all the heat of the day, and did
most worthily. Met with Creed, and he and I to Westminster and
there saw my Lord Marlborough brought to be buried — several
Lords of the Council carrying him, and with the Heralds in some
state. Thence, vexed in my mind to think that I do so little in my
Tanger business, and so home, and after supper to bed.
