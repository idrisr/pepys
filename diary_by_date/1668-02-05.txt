Up, andI to Capt. Cockes, where he and I did discourse of our
business that we are to go about to the Comissioners of Accounts,
about our prizes.' And having resolved to conceal nothing but
confess the truth, the truth being likely to do us most good, we
parted; and I to Whitehall, where missing of the Commissioners of
the Treasury, I to the Commissioners of Accounts, where I was
forced to stay two hoursI believe before I was called in; and when
came in, did take an oath to declare the truth to what they should
ask me (which is a great power, I doubt more then the Act doth, or
as some say can, give them: to force a man to swear against
himself); and so they fell to enquire about the business of prize
goods, wherein I did answer them as wellasI could answer them, to
everything the just truth, keeping myself to that. I do perceive at
last that that they did lay most like a fault to me was that I did buy
goods upon my Lord Sandwiches declaring that it was with the
King’s allowance, and my believing it without seeing the King’s
allowance — which is a thing I will own, and doubt not to justify
myself in. They were inquisitive into the meanest perticulars, and
had had great information; but I think that it can do me no hurt, at
the worst more then to make me refund, ifit must be known, what
profit I did make of my agreement with Capt. Cocke. And yet
though this be all, yet I do find so poora spirit within me, that it
makes me almost out of my wits, and puts me to so much pain that I
cannot think of anything, nor do anything but vex and fret and
imagine myself undone —so that I am ashamed of myself to myself,
and do fear what would become of me if any real affliction should
come upon me.
