At the office all the morning, though little to be done because
all our Clerkes are gone to the buriall of Tom. Whitton, one of the
Controllers Clerkes, a very ingenious and a likely young man to
live as any in the office. But it is such a sickly time, both in City and
country everywhere (of a sort of fever) that never was heard of
almost, unless it was in a plague time. Among others, the famous
Tom. Fuller is dead of it—and Dr. Nichols, Deane of Pauls; and my
Lord Generall Monke is very dangerous ill. Dined at home with the
Children and were merry, and my father with me.
