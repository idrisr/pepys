Capt. Cocke tells me how the King was vexed the other day
for having no paper laid him at the Council table as was usual; and
that Sir Rd. Browne did tell his Majesty he would call the person
whose work it was to provide it — who being come, did tell His
Majesty that he was but a poor man, and was out 4 or soo! for it,
which was as much as he is worth; and that he cannot provide it any
longer without money, having not received a penny since the
King’s coming in. So the King spoke to my Lord Chamberlaine;
and many such Mementos the King doth nowadays meet withal,
enough to make an ingenuous [man] mad. I to Deptford, and there
scolded with a master for his ship’s not being gone. And so home to
the office and did business till my eyes are sore again; and so home
758
to sing and then to bed, my eyes failing me mightily.
