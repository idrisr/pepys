Early in the morning to the Exchequer, where I told over what
money I have of my Lord’s and my own there, whichI find to be
9701: thence to Will’s, where Spicer and I eat our dinner of a roasted
leg of porke which Will did give us. And after that, I to the Theatre,
where was acted Beggars bush —it being very well done; and here the
first time that ever saw Women come upon the stage. From thence
to my father’s, where I find my mother gone by Bird the carrier to
Brampton, upon my uncles great desire, my aunt being now in
despairoflife. So home.
