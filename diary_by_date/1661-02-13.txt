At the office all the morning. Dined at home; and poor Mr.
Wood with me — who after dinner would have borrowed money
of me, but I would lend none. Then to Whitehall by coach with
Sir W. Pen, where we did very little business; and so back to Mr.
Rawlinson’s, where I took him in and gave him a cup of wine —
he having formerly known Mr. Rawlinson. And here I met my
uncle Wight and he drank with us. Then with him to Sir W.
Batten’s; whither I sent for my wife and we chose Valentines
against tomorrow. My wife chose me, which did much please
me. My Lady Batten, Sir W. Pen &c. Here we sat late; and so
home to bed — having got my Lady Batten to give me a spoonful
1. Taken by the pirates of Algiers.

of hony for my cold.
