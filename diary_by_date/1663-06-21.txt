Lords day. Up betimes and fell to reading my Latin grammer,
whichIperceive I have great need of, having lately found it by my
calling Will to the reading ofa Chapter in Latin; and Iam resolved to
go through it. After being trimmed, I by water to Whitehall and so
over the parke, it raining hard, to Mr. Coventrys chamber— where I
spent two hours, talking with him about businesses of the Navy
and how by his absence things are like to go with us; and with good
content from my being with him, he carried me by coach and set me
down at Whitehall, and thence to rights home by water. He showed
me a list which he hath prepared for the parliament’s viewe if the
business of his selling of offices should be brought to further
hearing, wherein he reckons up, as I remember, 236 offices of ships
which have been disposed of without his taking one farthing. This,
of his own accord, he opened his Cabinett on purpose to show me;
meaning, I suppose, that I should discourse abroad of it and
vindicate him therein; which I shall with all my power do. At
home, being wet, shifting my band and things and then to dinner;
and after dinner went up and trieda little upon my Tryangle, which
I understand fully and witha little use I believe could bring myself
to do something. So to church and slept all the sermon, the Scott, to
whose voice I am not to be reconciled, preaching.
