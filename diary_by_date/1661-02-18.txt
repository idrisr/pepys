Atthe office all the morning. Dined at home witha very good
dinner; only my wife and I, which is not yet very usuall. In the
afternoon my wife and I and Mrs. Martha Batten, my Valentine, to
the Exchange; and there, upon a payre of embroydered and six
119
payre of plain white gloves, I laid out 40s. upon her. It is much
talked that the King is already marryed to the neece of the Prince de
Ligne and that he hath two sons already by her— which Iam sorry to
hear, but yet am gladder that it should be so then that the Duke of
Yorke and his family should come to the Crowne — he being a
professed friend to the Catholiques.
