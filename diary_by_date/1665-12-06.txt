Up betimes, it being Fast day, and by water to the Duke of
Albemarle, who came to town from Oxford last night. He is
mighty brisk, and very kind to me and asks my advice principally in
everything. He surprizes me with the news that my Lord Sandwich
goes Embassador to Spayne speedily — though I know not whence
this arises, yet I am heartily glad of it. He did give me several
directions what to do; and so I home by water again, and to churcha
little, thinking to have met Mrs. Pierce in order to our meeting at
night. But she not there, I home — and dined; and comes presently
by appointment my wife. I spent the afternoon upon a song of
Solyman’s words to Roxolana that I have set; and so with my wife
walked, and Mercer, to Mrs. Pierces, where Capt. Rolt and Mrs.
Knipp, Mr. Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Mrs. Worship, and
her singing daughter met; and by and by unexpectedly comes Mr.
Pierce from Oxford. Here the best company for Musique Iever was
in in my life, and wish I could live and die in it, both for music and
the face of Mrs. Pierce and my wife and Knipp, who is pretty
enough, but the most excellent mad-hum[ou]rd thing; and sings
the noblest that ever I heard in my life, and Rolt with her, some
things together most excellently — I spent the night in an ecstasy
almost; and having invited them to my house a day or two hence,
we broke up — Pierce having told me that he is told how the King
560
hath done my Lord Sandwich all the right imaginable, by showing
him his countenance before all the world on every occasion, to
remove thoughts of discontent — and that he is to go Embassador;
and that the Duke of Yorke is made Generall of all forces by land
and sea, and the Duke of Albemarle Lieutenant-Generall; whether
the two latter alterations be so true or no, he knows not, but he is
told so — but myLord is in full favour with the King. So all home
and to bed.
