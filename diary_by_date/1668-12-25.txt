Christmas day. Up, and continued on my waistcoat, the first
day this winter. And I to church, where Ald. Backewell coming in
973
late, I beckoned to his lady to come up to us; who did, with another
lady; and after sermon I led her down through the church to her
husband and coach~a noble, fine woman, and a good one—and one
my wife shall be acquainted with. So home and to dinner alone with
my wife, who, poor wretch, sat undressed all day till 10 at night,
altering and lacing of a black petticoat — while I by her, making the
boy read to me the life of Julius Caesar and Des Cartes book of
music — the latter of which I understand not, nor think he did well
that writ it, though a most learned man. Then after supper made the
boy play upon his lute, which I have not done twice before sence he
came to me; and so, my mind in mighty content, we to bed.
