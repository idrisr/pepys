Up, and by water to Whitehall, and there at the Robe-
chamber at a Committee for Tanger; where some of us, my Lord
Sandwich, Sir W. Coventry, and myself, with another or two, met
to debate the business of the Molle and there draw up reasons for the
King’s taking of it into his own hands and managing of it upon
accounts with Sir H. Cholmly. This being done, I away to
Holborne about Whetstones park, where I never was in my life
before, where Iunderstand by my wife’s discourse that Deb is gone;
which doth trouble me mightily, that the poor girl should be in a
desperate condition forced to go thereabouts; and there, not hearing
ofany such manas Allbon, with whom my wife said she now was, I
to the Strand and there, by sending of Drumbleby’s boy, my
flagelette-maker, to Eagle court, where my wife also by discourse
lately let fall that he did lately live, I found that this Dr. Allbon is a
kind of a poor broken fellow that dare not show his head nor be
known where he is gone; but to Lincoln’s Inn fields I went, to Mr.
Povy’s, but missed him; and so hearing only that this Allbon is gone
to Fleet street, I did only call at Martins my bookseller’s, and there
bought Cassandra and some other French books for my wife’s
closet; and so home, having eat nothing but two pennorth of
Oysters, opened for me by a woman in the Strand while the boy
went to and again to inform me about this man; and therefore home
and to dinner, and so all the afternoon at the office and there late,
busy; and so home to supper and, pretty pleasant with my wife, to
bed — and rested pretty well.
