Up and despatched things into the country — to my father’s —
and two Keggs of Sturgeon and a dozen bottles of wine to
Cambrige for my Cosen Rogr. Pepys, which I gave him. By and by
down by water on several Deale ships and stayed upon a Stage in
one place, seeing Calkers sheathing of a ship. Then at Wapping to
my carvers about my viall head. So home, and thence to my viall-
293
maker’s in Bishopsgate street; his name is Wise, who isa pretty
fellow at it. Thence to the Exchange and so home to dinner. And
then to my office, wherea full board and busy all the afternoon; and
among other things, made a great contract with Sir W. Warren for
40000 deales Swinsound, at 3/ 17s. per cent. In the morning, before I
went on the water, I was at Thamestreet about some pitch; and
there meeting Anthony Joyce, I took him and Mr. Stacy the Tarr
merchant to the tavern — where Stacy told me many old stories of
my Lady Battens former poor condition, and how her former
husband broke, and how she came to her estate. At night, after
office done, I went to Sir W. Batten, where my Lady and I [had]
some high words about emptying our housesofoffice; where I did
tell her my mind and at last agreed that it should be done through
myoffice, ‘and so all well. So home and to bed.
