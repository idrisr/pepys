At night sent a packet to London. And Mr. Cooke returned
thence, bringing me this news: that the Sectarys do talk high what
they will do; but I believe all to no purpose. That the Cavaliers are
something unwise to talk so high on the other side as they do. That
it is evident now that the Generall and the Council do resolve to
make way for the King’s coming. And it is now clear that either the
Fanatiques must now be undone, or the Gentry and citizens
throughout England and clergy must fall, in spite of their Militia
and army, which is not at all possible Ithink. At night Isupped with
W. Howe and Mr. Luellin (being the first time that I have been so
long with him) in the great cabin below. After that to bed; and W.
Howe sat by my bedside and he and I sang a psalm or two; and so I
to sleep.
