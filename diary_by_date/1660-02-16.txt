Inthe morning at my lute. Then came Shaw and Hawly, andI
gave them their morning draught at my house. So to my office,
where I writ by the carrier to my Lord; and sealed my letter at Wills
and gave it old East to carry it to the carrier’s — and to take up a box
16
of China oranges and two little barrels of Scallops at my house,
which Capt. Cuttance sent to me for my Lord. Here I met with
Osborne and with Shaw and Spicer, and then we went to the Sun
tavern in expectation of a dinner, where we had sent us only two
trencherfuls of meat, at which we were very merry, while in came
Mr. Wade and his friend Capt. Moyse, and here we stayed till 7 at
night, I winning a Quart of sack of Shaw that one trencherful that
was sent us was all lamb, and he that it was veale. I, by having but
3d. in my pocket, made shift to spend no more; whereas ifIhad had
more Ihad spent more, as the rest did. So thatI see it is an advantage
to a man to carry little in his pocket. Home; and after supper and a
little at my lute, I went to bed.
