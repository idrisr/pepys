Tomy Lord at his lodging and came to Westminster with him
in the coach, and he in the Painted chamber walked a good while;
andI telling him that I was willing and ready to go with him to sea,

Downing about it. All night troubled in my thoughts how to order
my business upon this great change with me, that I could not sleep;
and being overheated with drink, I made a promise the next
morning to drink no strong drink this week, for I find that it makes
me sweat in bed and puts me quite out of order.
