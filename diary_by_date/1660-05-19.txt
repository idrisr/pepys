my old chamber-fellow Mr. Ch. Anderson anda
friend of his (both
Physicians), Mr. Wright, who took me to a Duch house where
there was an exceeding pretty lass and right for the sport; but it
being Saturday, we could not have much of her company; but
however, I stayed with them (having left the child with his uncle
Pickering, who I met in the streets) till 12 at night; by that time
Charles was almost drunk; and then broke up, he resolving to go
thither again (after he had seen me at my lodging) and lie with the
girl, which he told me he had done in the morning. Going to my
lodging, we met with the bellman, who strikes upon a clapper,
which I took in my hand and it isjust like the clapper that our boys
fright the birds away from the corn with in summer time in
England. To bed.
