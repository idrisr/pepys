By myself at the office all the morning, drawing up instruc-
cions for Portsmouth yard in those things wherein we at our late
being there did think fit to reforme. And got them signed this
morning to send away tonight, the Duke being now there. At the
office all afternoon; and in the evening comes Sir G. Carteret, and
he and I did hire a ship for Tanger, and other things together; and I
find that he doth single me out to join with him apart from the rest;
which I am much glad of. So home; and after being trimmed, to
bed.
