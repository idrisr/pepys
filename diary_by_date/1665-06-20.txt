Thanksgiving day for Victory over the Dutch. Up, and to the
office, where very busy alone all the morning till church time; and
there heard a mean sorry sermon of Mr. Mills. Then tothe Dolphin
Taverne, where all we officers of the Navy met with the
Comissioners of the Ordnance by agreement and dined — where
good Musique, at my direction. Our club came to 34s. a man—nine
of us. Thence after dinner I to Whitehall with Sir W. Berkely in his
coach. And soI walked to Herberts and there spenta
little time avec
la mosa, sin hazer algo con ella que kiss and tocar ses mamelles, que
498
me haza hazer la cosa a mi mismo con gran plaisir. Thence by
water to Foxhall, and there walked an hour alone, observing the
several humours of the citizens that were there this holiday,
pulling of cherries and God knows what. And so home to my
office, where late, my wife not being come home with my
mother, who have been this day all abroad upon the water, my
mother being to go out of town speedily. So I home and to supper
and to bed. This day I informed myself that there died four or five
at Westminster of the plague, in one alley in several houses upon
Sunday last — Bell Alley, over against the Palace gate. Yet people
do think that the number will be fewer in the town then it was the
last week.
