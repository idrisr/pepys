Having been exceedingly disturbed in the night with the
barking of
a dogof oneofour neighbours, that I could not sleep for
an hour or two, I slept late; and then in the morning took physic,
and so stayed within all day. Atnoon myBrother John came to me,
and I corrected as well as I could his Greek speech against the
Apposition, though I believe he himself was as well able to do it as
myself. After that, we went to read in the great Officiale about the
blessing of bells in the Church of Rome. After that, my wife and Iin
pleasant discourse till night that I went to supper, .and after that to
make an end of this week’s notes in this book, and so to bed. It being
a cold day and a great snow, my physic did not work so well as it
should have done.
