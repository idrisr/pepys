Lords day. Up, and to my chamber, and there begun to draw
out fair and methodically my accounts of Tanger in order to show
them to the Lords. But by and by comes by agreement Mr. Reeves,
and after him Mr. Spong; and all day with them, both before and
after dinner till 10 a-clock at night, upon Opticke enquiries — he
bringing me a frame with closes on, to see how the Raysoflight do
cut one another, and in a dark room with smoake, which is very
pretty. He did also bring a lantern, with pictures in glass to make
strange things appear ona wall, very pretty. We did also at night see
Jupiter and his girdle and Satellites very fine with my 12-foot glass,
but could not Saturne, he being very dark. Spong and I also had
several fine discourses upon the globes this afternoon, perticularly
why the fixed stars do not rise and set at the same hour all the year
long, which he could not demonstrate, nor I neither, the reason of.
So it being late, after supper they away home. But it vexed me to
understand no more from Reeves and his glasses touching the
nature and reason of the several refractions of the several figured
glasses, he understanding the acting part but not one bit the theory,
nor can make anybody understand it — which is a strange dullness
methinks.
