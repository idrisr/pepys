To Westminster; and at the Privy Seale I saw Mr. Coventrys
seal for his being Comissioner with us — at which I know not yet
whether to be glad or otherwise. So, doing several things by the
way, I walked home; and after dinner to the office all the afternoon.
At night all the bells in the towne rung, and bonefires made for the
joy of the Queenes arrivall; who came and landed at Portsmouth
last night. But I do not see much thorough joy, but only an
indifferent one, in the hearts of people, who are much discontented
at the pride and luxury of the Court, and running in debt. So to bed.
