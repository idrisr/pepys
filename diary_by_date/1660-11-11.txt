Lords day. This morning Iwent to Sir W. Batten’s about going
to Deptford tomorrow. And so, eating some hog’s pudding of my
Lady’s making, of the hog that Isaw a-fattening the other day at her
house, he and I went to church into our new Gallery (the first time
that ever it was used and it not being yet quite finished );there came
after us Sir W. Pen, Mr. Davis, and his eldest son. There being no
women this day, we sat in the foremost pew and behind us our
servants; but I hope it will not be always so, it not being handsome
for our servants to sit so equal with us. This day also did Mr. Mills
begin to read all the Common prayer, which Iwas glad of. Home to
dinner. And then walked to Whitehall, it being very cold and foule
and rainy weather. I found my Lord at home; and after giving him
an account of some business, I returned and went to my father’s,
where I found my wife. And there we supped and Dr. Tho. Pepys
(who my wife told me after I was come home that he hath told my
Brother Tho. that he loved my wife so well that ifshe have a childe
he would never marry, but leave all that he hath to my childe); and
after supper we walked home, my little boy carrying a link and Will
leading my wife. So home and to prayers and to bed.
