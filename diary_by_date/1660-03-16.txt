Nosooner out of bed but troubled with abundance of Clients,
seamen. My landlords, Vanly’s, man came to me and I paid him
rent for my house for this Quarter ending at Ladyday, and took an
acquittance that he brought me from his master. Then to Mr.
Sheply to the Rhenish winehouse; where Mr. Pim the tailor was,
and gave us a morning draught and a neat’s tongue. Home, and
with my wife to London. We dined at my father’s, where Joyce
Norton and Mr. Armiger dined ‘also; after dinner my wife took
leave of them in order to her going tomorrow to Huntsmore. In my
way homeI went to the Chappell in Chancery lane to bespeak paper
of all sorts and other things belonging to writing, against my
voiage. So home, where I spent an hour or two about my business
in my study. Then to Westminster hall, where I heard how the
Parliament had this day dissolved themselfs and did pass very
cheerfully through the Hall and the Speaker without his Mace. The
whole Hall was joyful thereat, as well as themselfs; and now they
begin to talk loud of the King. Tonight I am told that yesterday,
28
about § a-clock in the afternoon, one came witha ladder to the great
Exchange and wiped with a brush the Inscripcion that was upon
King Charles, and that there was a great bonefire made in the
Exchange and people cried out “God bless King Charles the
Second!”’ From the Hall I went home to bed, very sad in mind to
part with my wife tomorrow, but God’s will be done.
