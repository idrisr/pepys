Up, and after doing some business at my office, abroad to
Lumbardstreete, about the getting of a good sum of money; thence
home, in preparation for my having some good sum in my hands,
for fear of a trouble in the State, that I may not have all J have in the
world out of my hands and so be left a beggar. Having put that in a
way, I home to the office; and so to the Tower about shipping of
640
some more pressed men — and that done, away to Broadstreete to
Sir G. Carteret, who is at a pay of Tickets all alone. And I believe
not less then rooo people in the streets. But it is a pretty thing to
observe, that both there and everywhere else a man shall see many
women nowadays of mean sort in the streets, but no men; men
being so afearedofthe press. I dined with Sir G. Carteret; and after
dinner had much discourse about our public business, and he doth
seem to fear every day more and more what I do, which is a general
confusion in the State. Plainly answering me to the question, Who
is it that the weight of the Warr depends? that it is only Sir W.
Coventry. Thence to Lumberdstreete, and received 2000! and
carried it home — whereof, 1oool in gold, the greatest quantity, not
only that I ever had of gold, but that ever I saw together. Thence
down to the Old Swan, calling at Michells, he not being within; and
there I did steal a kiss or two of her, and stayingalittle longer, he
came in, and her father, whom I carried to Westminster, my
business being thither; and so back again home, and very busy all
the evening; at night, a song in the garden and to bed.
