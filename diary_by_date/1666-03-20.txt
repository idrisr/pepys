Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon
dined in haste, and so my wife, Mrs. Barbary, Mercer, and I by
coach to Hales, where I find my wife’s picture now perfectly
finished in all respects, and a beautiful picture it is, as almost I ever
saw. I sat again, and had a great deal done; but whatever the matter
is, do not fancy that it hath the ayre of my face, though it will be a
very fine picture. Thence home and to my business, being post-
night; and so home to supper and to bed.
