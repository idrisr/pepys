Lay long today, pleasantly discoursing with my wife about the
dinner we are to have for the Joyces a day or two hence. Then up
and with Mr. Margetts to Limehouse to see his ground and
ropeyard there; which is very fine, and I believe we shall imploy it
for the Navy — for the King’s grounds are not sufficient to supply
our dispense if a warr comes. Thence back to the Change — where
great talk of the forwardness of the Dutch; which puts us all to a
stand, and perticularly myself for my Lord Sandwich, to think him
to lie where he is for a Sacrifice if they should begin with us. So
home and Creed with me, and to dinner; and after dinner, I out to
my office, taking in Bagwells wife, who I knew waited for me; but
company came to me so soon, that I could have no discourse with
her as I intended, of pleasure. So anon abroad with Creed; walked
to Bartholomew fayre, this being the last day, and there saw the
best dancing on the ropes that I think I ever saw in my life — and so
all say. And so by coach home - where I find my wife hath had her
head dressed by her woman Mercer, which is to come to her
tomorrow; but my wife being to go to a christening tomorrow, she
came to do her head up tonight. So a while to my office, and then to
supper and to bed.
