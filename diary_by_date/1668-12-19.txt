Up, and to the office, where all the morning; and at noon,
eating very little dinner, my wife and I by hackney to the King’s
playhouse and there, the pit being full, sat in a box above and saw
Catelin’s Conspiracy — yesterday being the first day —a play of much
good sense and words to read, but that doth appear the worst upon
the stage, I mean the least divertising, that ever I saw any, though
most fine in clothes anda fine Scene of the Senate and ofa fight, that
ever I saw in my life — but the play is only to be read. And therefore
home with no pleasure at all, but only in sitting next to Betty Hall,
that did belong to this House and was Sir Ph. Howard’s mistress; a
mighty pretty wench, though my wife will not think so, and I dare
neither commend nor be seen to look upon her or any other now,
for fear of offending her. So, our own coach coming for us, home
and to end letters; and so home, my wife to read to me out of The
Siege ofRhodes; and so to supper and to bed.
