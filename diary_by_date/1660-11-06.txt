To the Sun and did give [Mr. Creed and Mr. Chetwind] a
barrel of oysters and have good discourse; among other things, Mr.
Chetwind told me how he did fear that this late business of the
Duke of Yorke’s’ will prove fatal to my Lord Chancellor. From
thence Mr. Creed and I to Wilkinsons and dined together; and in
great haste thence to our office, where we met all commonly, for
the sale of two ships by an inch of candle (the first time that ever I
saw any of this kind), where I observed how they do invite one
another and at last how they all do cry; and we have much to do
to tell who did cry last. The ships were the Indian sold for 1300,
and the Halfe moone sold for 8301. Home and fell a-reading of the
tryalls of the late men that were hanged for the King’s death; and
found good satisfaccion in reading thereof. At night to bed; and
my wife and I did fall out about the dog’s being put down into
the Sellar, which I have a mind to have done because of his fouling
the house; and I would have my will. And so we went to bed and
lay all night in a Quarrell. This night I was troubled all night with
a dream that my wife was dead, which made me that I slept ill all
night.
