1663-10-30

In the afternoon by water to Whitehall to the Tanger
Committee, where my Lord Tiviott brought his accounts; which
grieves me to see, that his accounts being to be examined by us,
there is none of the great men at the Board that in compliment will
except against anything in his accounts, and so none of the little
persons dare do it: so the King is abused.
