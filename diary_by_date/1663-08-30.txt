Lerds day. Lay long, then up; and Will being ill of the
toothake, I stayed at home and made up my accounts; which to my
great content arise to 750/ clear Creditor, the most I have had yet.
Dined alone with my wife, my brother dining abroad at my uncle
Wights I think. To church, I alone, in the afternoon; and there saw
Pembleton come in and look up, which put me into a sweat, and
seeing not my wife there, went out again. But Lord — how I was
afeared that he might, seeing me at church, go home to my wife; so
much it is out of my power to preserve myself from jealousy — and
so sot impatient all the sermon. Home and find all well and no sign
of anybody being there, and so with great content playing and
dallying with my wife; and so to my office, doinga little business
there among my papers, and home to my wife to talk — supper and
bed.
