Atthe office all the morning. At noon the children are sent for
by their mother, my Lady Sandwich, to dinner, and my wife goes
along with them by coach; and she to my father’s and dines there
and from thence with them to see Mrs. Cordery, who doth invite
them before my father goes into the country; and thither I should
~ have gone too, but that I am sent for to the Privy Seale: and there I
find a thing of my Lord Chancellors to be sealed this afternoon and
so I am forced to go to Worcester house, where several Lords are
met in council this afternoon. And while I am waiting there, in
comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet capp, in
which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known
him. So walked home; and there I find that my Lady doth keep the
children at home and lets them not come any more hither at present
~ whichalittle troubles me, to lose their company. This day my
aunt Fenner dyed.
