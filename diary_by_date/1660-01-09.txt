For these two or three days, I have been much troubled with
thoughts how to get money to pay them that I have borrowed
money of, by reason of my money being in my Uncles hands. Irose
early this morning, and looked over and corrected my brother
John’s speech which he is to make the next Apposition; and after
4
that I went towards my office and in my way met with W. Simons,
Muddiman, and Jack Price and went with them to Harpers, and in
many sorts of talk I stayed till 2 of the clock in the afternoon.
Thence I went with Muddiman to the Coffee-house, and gave 18d.
to be entered of the Club.! Thence into the Hall, where I heard for
certain that Monke was coming to London. Thence to Mrs. Jem
and found her in bed, and some was afraid that it would prove the
smallpox. Thence back to Westminster hall, where I heard how Sir
H. Vane was this day voted out of the House and to sit ho more
there. Here I met with [the] Quarter Maister of my Lord’s troop
and his clerk Mr. Jenings, and took them home and gave [them] a
bottle of wine and the remainder of my collar of brawn, and so
good-night. After that, came in Mr. Hawly, who told me that Iwas
missed this day at my office and that tomorrow I must pay all the
money that I have, at which I was put to a great loss how I should
get money to make up my cash, and so went to bed in great trouble.
