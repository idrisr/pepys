Up betimes and so to my office, there to do business —till
about 10 a-clock; and then out with my wife and Deb and W.
Hewers by coach to Common garden Coffee-house, where by
appointment I was to meet Harris; which I did, and also Mr.
Cooper the great painter and Mr. Hales; and thence presently to
Mr. Cooper’s house to see some of his work; which is all in little,
but so excellent, as though Imust confess Ido think the colouring of
897
the flesh to bea
little forced, yet the painting is so extraordinary, asI
do never expect to see the like again. Here I did see Mrs. Stewards
picture as when a young maid, and now again done just before her
having the smallpox; and it would make a man weep to see what she
was then, and what she is like to be, by people’s discourse, now.
Here I saw my Lord Generalls picture, and my Lord Arlington and
Ashlys, and several others; but among the rest, one Swinfen, that
was Secretary to my Lord Manchester, Lord Chamberlain (with
Cooling), done so admirably as I never saw anything; but the
misery was, this fellow died in debt and never paid Cooper for his
picture; but it being seized on by his creditors among his other
goods after his death, Cooper himself says that he did buy it, and
gave 25] out of his purse for it, for what he was to have had but 30.
