Up early and to look over my works, and find my house to go
on apace. So to my office to prepare business; and then we met and
sat till noon. And then Comissioner Pett and I being invited, went
by Sir John Winter’s coach, sent for us, to the Miter in Fanchurch
street — to a venison-pasty; where Ifind him a very worthy man and
good discourse — most of which was concerning the Forrest of
Deane and the timber there and Iron workes, with their great
antiquity and the vast heaps of cinders which they find, and are now
of great value, being necessary for the making of Iron at this day and
without which they cannot work. Thence to my office about
business till late, and so home and to bed.
