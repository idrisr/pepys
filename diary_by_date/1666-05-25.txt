Up betimes, and to my chamber to do business, where the
greatest part of the morning. Then out to the Change to speak with
Capt. [Cocke], who tells me my silver plates are ready for me, and
shall be sent me speedily. And proposes another proposition of
serving us with a thousand tons of hemp, and tells me it shall bring
me 500 ifthe bargain go forward — which is a good word. Thence I
to Sir G. Carteret, who is at the pay of the tickets with Sir
J.Mennes
this day; and here.sat with them a while, the first time I ever was
there. And thence to dinner with him —a good dinner. Here came a
Gentleman over from France, arrived here this day, Mr. Browne of
St. Mellos— who, among other things, tells me the meaning of the
setting out of dogs every night out of the town walls, which are said
to secure the city; but it is not so, but only to secure the Anchors,
cables, and ships that lie dry, which might otherwise in the night be
619
liable to be robbed. And these dogs are set out every night and
called together in every morning by a man with a horne, and they
go in very orderly.
