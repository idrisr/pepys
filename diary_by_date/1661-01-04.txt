Office all the morning; dined at home, and Mr. Moore with me
— with whom I had been early this morning at Whitehall at the
Jewell Office, to choose of a piece of gilt plate for my Lord in
returne of his offering to the King (which it seems is usuall at this
time of the year, and an Earle gives 20 pieces in gold ina purse to the
King). I chosea gilt tankard weighing 31 ounces and a half, and he is
allowed 30; so I paid 12s. for the ounce and a half over what he is to
have. But strange it was to me to see what a company of small Fees I
was called upon by a great many to pay there; whichIperceive is the
manner that courtiers do get their estates. After dinner Mr. Moore
and I to the Theatre, where was The Scornefull Lady acted very well
108
—it being the first play that ever he saw.’ Thence with him to drink
a cup of ale at Hercules pillars, and so parted. I called to see my
father, who told me by the way how Will and Mary Joyce do live a
strange life together, nothing but fighting, &c., so that sometimes
her father hath a mind to have them divorced. Thence home.
