Shrovetuesday. I left my wife in bed, being indisposed by
reason of ceux-la — and I to Mrs. Turners, who I find busy with
The[oph]. and Joyce making of things ready for Fritters. So Ito Mr.
Crews and there delivered Cottgraves dictionary — to my Lady
Jemimah. And then with Mr. Moore to my Cozen Tom Pepys’s;
but he being out of town, I spoke with his lady — though notof the
business I went about, which was to borrow 1oool for my Lord.
Back to Mrs. Turners, where several friends, all strangers to me but
Mr. Armiger, din’d. Very merry, and the best fritters that ever Ieat
in my life. After that look out at Window; saw the flinging at
Cocks.”
