At the office all the morning. At noon all of us dined at Capt.
Cockes at a good chine of beef and other good meat, but being all
frost-bitten, was most of it unroast; but very merry, and a good
dish of fowl we dressed ourselfs. Mr. Eveling there, in very good
humour. All the afternoon till night, pleasant, and then I took my
leave of them and to the office, where I wrote my letters, and away
home, my head full of business and some trouble for my letting my
accounts go so far; but I have made an oath this night for the
drinking no wine, &c., on such penalties, till I have passed my
account and cleared all. Coming home and going to bed, the boy
tells me his sister Daniel hath provided me a supper of little birds,
killed by her husband; and I made her sup with me, and after supper
were alone a great while and | had the pleasure of her lips — she being
a pretty woman, and one whom agreat belly becomes as well as
ever I saw any. She gone, I to bed. This day I was come to by Mrs.
Burrows of Westminster, Lieut. Burrows (lately dead) his widow,
a most pretty woman, and my old acquaintance. I had a kiss or two
of her, and a most modest woman she is.
