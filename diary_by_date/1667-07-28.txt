Lords day. Up, and to my chamber, where all the morning
close, to draw up a letter to Sir W. Coventry upon this tidings of
peace, taking occasion (before I am forced to it) to resign up to his
Royal Highness my place of the Victualling and to recommend
myself to him by promise of doing my utmost to improve this
813
peace in the best manner we may, to save the Kingdom from ruin.
By noon Ihad done this to my good content; and then with my wife
all alone to dinner, and so to my chamber all the afternoon to write
my letter fair; and sent it away, and then to talk with my wife and
read, and so by daylight (the only time I think I have done it this
year) to supper; and then to my chamber to read, and so to bed— my
mind very much eased after what I have done today.
