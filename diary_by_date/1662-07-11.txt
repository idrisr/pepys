Up by 4a-clock, and hard at my multiplicacion table, which I
am now almost maister of. And so made me ready and to my office
— where by and by comes Mr. Pett and then a messenger from Mr.
Coventry, who stays in his boat at the Tower for us; so we to him
and down to Deptford first and there viewed some Deales, lately
served in at a low price; which our officers, like knaves, would
undervalue in their worth — but we find them good. Then to
Woolwich and viewed well all the houses and stores there, which lie
in very great confusion for want of storehouses. And then to Mr.
Ackworths and Sheldens to view their books — which we find not to
answer the King’s service and security at all, as to the stores. Then
to the Ropeyard and there viewed the hemp, wherein we find great
corruption. And then sawa trial between Sir R. Fords yarn and our
own, and find great oddes. So by water back again, about 5 in the
afternoon, to Whitehall, and so to St. James’s and at Mr. Coventrys
chamber, which is very neat and fine, we had a pretty neat dinner;
and after dinner fell to discourse of business and regulation and do
think of many things that will put matters into better order.
