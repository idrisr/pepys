To my Lord Crews and there with him a good while; before
dinner talked of the Duch war and find that he doth much doubt
that we shall fall into it without the money or consent of Parliament
that is expected, or the reason for it that is fit to have for every war.
So to Capt. Cookes but he was not at home; but I there spoke with
my boy Tom Edwards and directed him to go to Mr. Townsend
(with whom I was in the morning) to have measure taken of his
clothes to be made him there out of the Wardrobe - which will be so
done, and then I think he will come to me. Thence to Whitehall; and
after long staying, there was no committee of the Fishery as was
expected. Here I walked long with Mr. Pierce, who tells me the
416
King doth still sup every night with my Lady Castlemayne, who he
believes hath lately slunka great belly away, for from very big she is
come to be down again. Thence to Mrs. Pierces and with her and
my wife to see Mrs. Clarke; where with him and her very merry,
discoursing of the late play of Henery the 5th — which they conclude
the best that ever was made. I am mightily pleased with [Dr.
Clarke] for he is the only man I know that I would learn to
pronounce by, which he doth the best that ever I heard any man.
Thence home and to the office late; and so to supper and to bed.
