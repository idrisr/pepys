Up and to the office, and there busy sitting till noon. I find at
home Mrs. Pierce and Knipp, come to dine with me. We were
mighty merry. And after dinner I carried them and my wife out by
coach to the New Exchange, and there I did give my valentine,
Mrs. Pierce, a dozen pair of gloves anda pair of silk stockings — and
Knipp, for company sake (though my wife had by my consent laid
out 20s. upon her the other day), six pair of gloves. Thence to
$97
Hales’s to have seen our pictures; but could not get in, he being
abroad. And so to the cake-house hard by, and there sat in the coach
with great pleasure and eat some fine cakes; and so carried them to
Pierces, and away home. It is a mighty fine witty boy, Mrs. pierce’s
little boy. Thence home and to the office, where late writing letters;
and leaving a great deal to do on Monday —I home to supper and to
bed. The truth is, I do indulge myselfa little the more pleasure,
knowing that this is the proper age of my life to do it, and out of my
observation that most men that do thrive in the world do forget to
take pleasure during the time that they are getting their estate but
reserve that till they have got one, and then it is too late for them to
enjoy it with any pleasure.
