In the evening came Capts. Hart and Hayword, and in talk
796
they told me about the taking of Royall Charles; that nothing but
carelessness lost the ship, for they might have saved her the very
tide that the Duch came up, ifthey would have but used means and
had had but boats, and that the want of boats plainly lost all the
other ships. That the Duch did take her with a boat of nine Men,
who found not a man on board her (and her laying so near them was
a main temptation to them to come on); and presently a man went
up and struck her flag and Jacke, and a trumpeter sounded upon her
‘‘Joan’s placket is torn.”’ That they did carry her down at a time,
both for tides and wind, when the best pilot in Chatham would not
have undertaken it, they heeling her on one side to make her draw
little water, and so carried her away safe. They being gone, by and
by comes Sir W. Pen home, and he andI together talking. He tells
me that it is most manifest that one great thing making it impossible
for us to have set out a fleet this year (ifwe could have done it for
money or stores) was the liberty given the beginning of the year for
the setting out of merchantmen, which did take up, as is said, above
10 1fnot 15000 seamen (and this the other day Capt. Cocke tells me
appears in the council-books; that is, the number of seamen
required to man the merchant ships that had passes to go abroad);
by and by, my wife being here, they sat down and eat a bit of their
nasty victuals, and so parted and we to bed.
