This day I was told that my Lady Castlemayne (being quite
fallen out with her husband) did yesterday go away from him with
all her plate, Jewells and other best things; and is gone to Richmond
to a brother of hers; which I am apt to think was a design to get out
of town, that the King might come at her the better. But strange it
is, how for her beauty I am willing to conster all this to the best and
213
to pity her wherein it is to her hurt, though I know well enough she
is a whore.
