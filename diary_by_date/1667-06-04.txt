Up and to the office; and there busy all the morning putting in
order the answering the great letter sent to the office by the new
Commissioners of the Treasury, who demand an account from the
King’s coming in to this day; which we shall do in the best manner
we can. At noon home to dinner; and to the office all the afternoon,
where I despatched much business to my great content; and then
home in the evening, and there to sing and pipe with my wife; and
that being done, she fell all of a sudden to discourse about her
clothes and my humours in not suffering her to wear them as she
pleases, and grew to high words between us. But I fell to read a
783
book (Boyle’s Hydrostatickes) aloud in my chamber and let her talk
till she was tired, and vexed that I would not hear her; and so
become friends and to bed together, the first night after four or five
that she hath lain from me by reason of a great cold she had got.
