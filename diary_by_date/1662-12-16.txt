I went by coach to my brother’s, where I met Sarah, my late
mayd, who told me out of good-will to me, for she loves me dearly,
that I would beware of my wife’s brother, for he is begging and
borrowing of her! often; and told me of her Scallop-whisk and her
borrowing of sos. from Will, which she believes for him and her
father. I do observe so much goodness and seriousness in the maid,
that Iam again and again sorry that Ihave parted with her, though it
was full against my will then. And ifshe had anything in the world,
I would commend her for a wife for my brother Tom.
