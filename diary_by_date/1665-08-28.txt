Up; and being ready, I out to Mr. Colvill the goldsmith’s,
having not for some days been in the streets. But now, how few
people I see, and those walking like people that had taken leave of

the world. I there, and made even all accounts in the world between
him and I in very good condition. And would have done the like
with Sir Rob. Viner, but he is out of town — the sickness being
everywhere thereabouts. I to the Exchange, and I think there was
not 50 people upon it and but few more like to be, as they told me,
Sir G. Smith and others. Thus, I think to take Adieu today of
London streets, unless it be to go again to Viners. Home to dinner,
and there W. Hewer brings me 119! he hath received for my office
disbursements, so that I think I have 1800! and more in the house;
and blessed be God, no money out but what I can very well
command, and that but very little — which is much the best posture I
ever was in in my life, both as to the quantity and the certainty I
have of the money I am worth, having most of it in my own hand.
But then this is a trouble to me, what to do with it, being myself this
day going to be wholly at Woolwich.’ But for the present I am
resolved to venture it in an Iron Chest — at least, for a while. In the
afternoon I sent down my boy to Woolwich with some things
before me, in order to my lying there for good and all, and so I
fallowed him. Just now comes news that the Fleete is gone, or going
this day, out again — for which God be praised; and my Lord
Sandwich hath done himself great right in it in getting so soon out
again. Pray God he may meet the Enemy.
