At the office all the morning. Thence my Lord Brunker
carried me as far as Mr. Povy’s and there I light and dined, meeting
Mr. Sherwin, Creed, &c. there upon his accounts. After dinner
they parted, and Mr. Povy carried me to Somersett house and there
showed me the Queen-mother’s chamber and closet, most beauti-
ful places for furniture and pictures; and so down the great stone
stairs to the garden and tried the brave Eccho upon the stairs —
which continues a voice so long as the singing three notes,
concords, one after another, they all three shall sound in consort
together a good while most pleasantly. Thence to a Tanger
Comittee at Whitehall, where I saw nothing ordered by judgment,
but great heat and passion and faction now, in behalf of my Lord
Bellasses and to the reproach of my Lord Tiviott, and dislike as it
were of former proceedings. So away with Mr. Povey, he carrying
me homeward to Mark lane in his coach. A simple fellow Inow find
him, to his utter shame, in his business of accounts, as none but a
sorry fool would have discovered himself — and yet in little light
sorry things, very cunning; yet in the principal, the most ignorant
man I ever met with in so great trust as he is. To my office till past
12, and then home to supper and to bed — being now mighty well;
and truly, I cannot but impute it to my fresh Hares Foote. Before I
went to bed,I sat up till 2 a~clock in my chamber, reading of Mr.
Hookes Microscopical Observations, the most ingenious book that
ever I read in my life.
