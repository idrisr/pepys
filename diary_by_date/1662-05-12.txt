Mr. Townsend called us up by 4 a-clock. And by 5 the three
ladies, my wife and I, and Mr. Townsend, his son and daughter,
were got to the barge and set out. We walked from Moreclacke to
Richmond, and so to boat again; and from Teddington to Hampton
Court, Mr. Townsend and Iwalked again —and there met the ladies
and were showed the whole house by Mr. Marriot — which endeed
is nobly furnished — perticularly the Queenes bed, given her by the
States of Holland. A Lookeing glase, sent by the Queene-Mother
from France, hanging in the Queens chamber. And many brave
pictures. So to Mr. Marriots, and there we rested ourselfs and
drank. And so to barge again, and there we had good victuals and
wine and were very merry. And got home about 8 at night, very
well. So my wife and I took leave of my Lady and home by a
hackny-coach, the easiest that ever I met with. And so to bed.
