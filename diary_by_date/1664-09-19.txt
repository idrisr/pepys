I met with Dr. Pierce today; who speaking of Dr. Fraizer’s
being so earnest to have such a one (one Collins) go Chyrurgeon to
the Princes person, and will have him go in his terms and with so
much money put into his hands, he tells me (when Iwas wondering
that Fraizer should order things with the Prince in that confident
manner) that Fraizer is so great with my Lady Castlemayne and
426
Steward and all the ladies at Court, in helping to slip their calfes
when there is occasion, and with the great men in curing of their
claps, that he can do what he please with the King in spite of any
man, and upon the same score with the Prince — they all having
more or less occasion to make use of him. Sir G. Carteret tells me
this afternoon that the Dutch are not yet ready to set out; and by that
means do lose a good wind, which would carry them out and keep
us in. And moreover, the says that they begin to bogle in the
business, and he thinks may offer terms of peace for all this; and
seems to argue that it will be well for the King too—and I pray God
send it.
