Lords day. To church in the morning, where the Reader made
a boyish young sermon. Home to dinner; and there I took occasion,
from the blackness of the meat as it came out of the pot, to fall out
with my wife and the maids for their sluttery; and so left the table
and went up to read in Mr. Selden till church time; and then my

wife and I to church and there in the pew, with the rest of the
company, was Capt. Holmes in his gold-laced suit; at which I was
troubled, because of the old business which he attempted upon my
wife. So with my mind troubled, I sat still; but by and by I took
occasion from the rain now holding up (it raining when we came
into the church) to put my wife in mind of going to the christening
(which she was invited to) of N. Osbornes child. Which she did;
and so went out of the pew and my mind was eased. So home after
sermon, and there came by appointment Dr. T. Pepys, Will Joyce,
and my brother Tom and supped with me; and very merry they
were and I seemed to be, but I was not pleased at all with their
company.'So they being gone, we went to bed.
