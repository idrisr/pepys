but in a closet we had a very good dinner by Mr. Pinkny’s courtesy.
And after dinner we had pretty good singing and one Hazard sung
alone after the old fashion, which was very much cried up; but I did
not like it. Thence we went to the Greene Dragon on Lambeth hill,
both the Mr. Pinknys, Smith, Harrison, Morrice that sang the bass,
Sheply and I, and there we sang of all sorts of things and I ventured
with good success upon things at first sight and after that played on
my flagelette; and stayed there till 9 a-clock, very merry and drawn
on with one song after another till it came to be so late. After that,
Sheply, Harrison and myself, we went towards Westminster on
foot, and at the Golden Lion, near Charing cross, we went in and
drank a pint of wine, and so parted; and thence home, where Ifound
my wife and maid a-washing. Isat up till the bell-man came by with
his bell, just under my window as I was writing of this very line,
and cried, “‘Past one of the clock, and a cold, frosty, windy
morning.” I then went to bed and left my wife and the maid a-
washing still.
