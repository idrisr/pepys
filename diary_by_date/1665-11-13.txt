Up, and to my office, where busy all the morning; and at
noon to Capt. Cockes to dinner as we had appointed, in order to
settle our business of accounts. But here came in an Alderman, a
merchant, a very merry man, and we dined; and he being gone —
after dinner Cocke and I walked into the garden and there, after a
little discourse, he did undertake under his hand to secure me in 500!
profit for my share of the profit of what we bought of the prize
goods; we agreed upon the terms, which were easier on my side
then I expected; and so, with extraordinary inward joy, we part till
the evening. SoI to the office, and among other business, prepared
a deed for him to sign and seal to me about our agreement, which at
night I got him to come and sign and seal. And so he and I to
Glanvills, and there he and I sat talking and playing with Mrs.
Penington, whom we found undressed in her smock and petticoats
by the fireside; and there we drank and laughed, and she willingly
suffered me to put my hand in her bosom very wantonly, and keep
it there long — which methought was very strange, and I looked
upon myself as a man mightily deceived in a lady, for I could not
have thought she could have suffered it, by her former discourse
with me —so modest she seemed, and I know not what. We stayed
here late; and so home, after he and I had walked till past midnight,
a bright moonshine, clear, cool night, before his door by the water;
and so I home after one of the clock.
