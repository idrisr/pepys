My dear friend Mr. Fuller of Twickenham and Idined alone at
the Sun taverne, where he told me how he hath the grant of being
Deane of St. Patrickes in Ireland, and I him my condition; and both
rejoiced one for another. My Lord abroad, and I to my house and
set things in a little order there. To bed, the first time since my
coming from sea, in my own house, for which God be praised.
