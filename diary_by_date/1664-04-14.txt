Upbetimes. And after my father’s eating something, Iwalked
out with him as far as Milk street, he turning down to Cripplegate
to take coach. And at the end of the street I took leave, being much
afeared I shall not see him here any more, he doth decay so much
every day. And so I walked on, there being never a coach to be had
till I came to Charing cross; and there Coll. Froud took me up and
carried me to St. James’s — where with Mr. Coventry and Povy &c.
about my Lord Peterborough’s accounts; but Lord, to see still what
a puppy that Povy is with all his show is very strange. Thence to
Whitehall and W. Coventry and I and Sir W. Rider resolved upon a
day to meet and make an end of all that business. Thence walked
with Creed to the Coffee-house in Covent garden, where no
company. But he told me many fine experiments at Gresham
College, and some demonstrating that the heat and cold of the
weather doth rarify and condense the very body of glasse; as, in a
Bolt head with cold water in it, put into hot water, shall first, by
rarifying the glass, make the water sink, and then when the heat
comes to the water, makes that rise again. And then put into cold
water, makes the water, by condensing the glass, to rise; and then
when the Cold comes to the water, makes it sink — which is very
pretty, and true; he saw it tried.
