Busy all the morning at the office. So home to dinner, where
Mercer; and there comes Mr. Swan, my old acquaintance, and
dines with me, and tells me for a certainty that Creed is to marry
Betty Pickering and that the thing is concluded; which Iwonder at—
and am vexed for. So he gone, I with my wife and two girls to the
King’s House and saw The Mad Couple, a mean play altogether; and
thence to Hyde park, where but few coaches; and so to the New
Exchange and thence by water home with much pleasure; and then
to sing in the garden, and so home to bed, my eyes for these four
days being my trouble, and my heart thereby mighty sad.
