Lay pretty long today, lying alone and thinking on several
businesses. So up to the office, and there till noon; thence with my
Lord Brouncker home by coach to Mrs. Williams’s, where Bab
Allen? and Dr. Charleton dined. Bab and I sang, and were mighty
merry as we could be there, where the rest of the company did not
overplease. Thence took her by coach to Hales’s, and there find
Mrs. Pierce and her boy and Mary. She had done sitting the first
time, and endeed her face is mighty like, at first dash. Thence took
them to the cake-house, and there called in the coach for cakes, and
drank; and thence Icarried them to my Lord Chancellors new house
to show them that, and all mightily pleased; thence set each down at
home, and so I home to the office — where about 10 of the clock W.
Hewers comes to me, to tell me that he left my wife well this
morning at Bugden (which was great riding), and brings mea letter
from her. She is very well got thither, of which I am heartily glad.
After writing several letters, | home to supper and to bed. The
Parliament, of which I was afeared of their calling us of the Navy to
an account of the expense of money and stores, and wherein we
were so little ready to give them a good answer. The Bishop of
Munster, everybody says, is coming to peace with the Dutch, we
having not supplied him with the monies promised him.
