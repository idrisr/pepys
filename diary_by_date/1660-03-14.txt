Tomy Lord, where infinite of applications to him and to me,
to my great trouble; my Lord he gave me all the papers that was
given to him, to put in order and give him an account of them. Here
I got half-a-piece of a person of Mr. Wrights recommending to my
Lord to be preacher in the Speaker frigate. Iwent hence to St. James,
and Mr. Pierce the surgeon with me, to speak with Mr. Clerke,
Monkes secretary, about getting some soldiers removed out of
Huntington to Oundle; which my Lord told me he did to do a
courtesy to the town, that he might have the greater interest in them
in the choice of the next Parliament. This done (where I saw Gen.
Monke and methought he seemed a dull, heavy man), he and I to
Whitehall, where with Luellin we dined at Marshes. Coming
home, telling my wife what we had to dinner, she had a mind to
some Cabbage, and I sent for some and she had it. Went to the
Admiralty, where a strange thing how I was already courted by the
people. This morning, among others that came to me, Ihired a boy
of Jenkins of Westminster, and Burr to be my clerk. So home and
late at night put up my things in a sea-chest that Mr. Sheply lent me
—and so to bed.
