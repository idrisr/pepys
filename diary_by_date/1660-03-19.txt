Early to my Lord, where infinite of business to do, which
makes my head full; and indeed, for these two or three days I have
not been without a great many cares and thoughts concerning
them. After that to the Admiralty, where a good while with Mr.
29
Blackborne, who told me that it was much to be feared that the
King would come in, for all good men and good things were now
discouraged. All the discourse nowaday is that the King will come
again; and for all I see, it is the wishes of all and all do believe that it
will be so. My mind is still much troubled for my poor wife, but I
hope that this undertaking will be worth my pains.
