Up, and pleased at Tom’s teaching of Barker something to
sing a third part toa song, which will please me mightily. SoI to the
office all the morning, and at noon to the Change, where I do hear
that letters this day come to Court do tell us that we are likely not to
agree, the Dutch demanding high terms and the King of France the
like, in a most braveing manner. The merchants do give themselfs
over for lost, no man knowing what to do, whether to sell or buy,
not knowing whether peace or war to expect; and I am told that
could that be now known, a man might get 20000! in a week’s time
— by buying up of goods in case there should be war. Thence home
and dined well; and then with my wife, set her at Unthankes andI to
Sir G. Carteret, where talked with the ladies a while; and my Lady
Carteret talks nothing but sorrow and afflictions coming on us; and
endeed, I do fear the same. So away, and met Dr. Fuller, Bishop of
Limricke, and walked an hour with him in the Court, talking of
news only; and he doth think that matters will be bad with us. Then
to Westminster hall and then spent an hour or two walking up and
down, thinking para aver got out Doll Lane, sed yo no could do it,
having no opportunity de hazer le, ainsi lost the todo afternoon; and
so away and called my wife and home, wherealittle at the office and
then home to my closet to enter my Journalls, and so to supper and
to bed.
