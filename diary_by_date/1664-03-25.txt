Lady day. Up and by water to Whitehall, and there to
Chappell, where it was most infinite full to hear Dr. Critton. He
said the greatest part of the Lay Magistrates in England were
puritans and would not do justice;' and the Bishops, their powers
were so taken away and lessened, that they could not exercise the
power they ought. He told the King and the ladies, plainly speaking
of death and of the skulls and bones of dead men and women, how
there is no difference — that nobody could tell that of the great
Marius or Alexander from a pyoneer; nor, for all the pains the ladies
take with their faces, he that should look in a Charnell-house could
not distinguish which was Cleopatras or fair Rosamonds or Jane
Shoares. Thence by water home. After dinner to the office. Thence
with my wife to see my father and discourse how he finds Tom’s
matters, which he doth very ill, and that he finds him to have been
so negligent that he used to trust his servants with cutting out of
clothes, never hardly cutting out anything himself. And by the
abstract of his accounts, we find him to [owe] about above 2901 and
to be coming to him under 200/. Thence home with my wife, it
being very durty on foot, and bought some fowl in Gracious street
and some oysters against our feast tomorrow. So home; and after at
the office a while, home to supper and to bed.
