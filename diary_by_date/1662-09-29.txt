Michaelmas day. This day my oaths for drinking of wine and
going to plays are out, and so! do resolve to takea liberty today and
then to fall to them again. Up and by coach to Whitehall, in my way
taking up Mr. Moore and walked with him, talking a good while
about business in St. James’s parke. And there left him and to Mr.
Coventry’s, and so with him and Sir W. Penn up to the Duke;
where the King came also and stayed till the Duke was ready. To
Toms, and there taking up my wife, maid, dog and him, did carry
them home
- where my wife is much pleased with my house, and so
am I fully. I sent for some dinner and there dined (Mrs. Margt Pen
being by, to whom I had spoke to go along with us to a play this
afternoon) and then to the King’s Theatre, where we saw
Midsummers nights dreame, which I have never seen before, nor shall
ever again, for it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in
my life. I saw, I confess, some good dancing and some handsome
women, which was all my pleasure.
