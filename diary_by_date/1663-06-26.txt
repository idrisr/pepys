Sir W. Batten, Sir
J.Mennes, my Lady Batten and I by coach
to Bednall green to Sir W. Riders to dinner — where a fine place,
good lady, and their daughter Mrs. Middleton, a fine woman. A
noble dinner and a fine merry walk with the ladies alone after dinner
in the garden, which is very pleasant. The greatest Quantity of
Strawberrys I ever saw, and good. At table, discoursing of thunder
and lightning, they told many stories of their own knowledge at
table; of their masts being shivered from top to bottom, and
sometimes only within and the outside whole. But among the rest,
Sir Wm. Rider did tell a story of his own knowledge, that a Genoese
Gally in Legorne roade was struck by thunder so as the mast was
broke a-pieces and the shackle upon one of the slaves was melted
clear off of his leg, without hurting his leg. Sir Wm. went on board
the vessel and would have contributed toward the release of the
slave whom Heaven had thus set free, but he could not compass it
and so he was brought to his fetters again. In the evening home; and
Ia little to my Tryangle and so to bed.
