At the office all morning; and at noon Mr. Coventry, who sat
with us all this morning, and Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Penn and
myself by coach to Capt. Marshes at Limehouse, to a house that
hath been their ancestors for this 250 years — close by the Lime-
house which gives the name to the place. Here they havea design to
get the King to hire a docke for the herring busses (which is now the
great design on foote) to lie up in. We had a very good and
handsome dinner, and excellent wine. I not being neat in clothes,
whichI find a great fault in me, could not be so merry as otherwise
and at all times I am and can be, when I am in good habitt; which
makes me remember my father Osborne’s’ rule for a gentleman,
to spare in all things rather then in that. So by coach home; and so to
write letters by post, and so to bed.
