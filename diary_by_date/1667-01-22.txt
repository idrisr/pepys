Up, and there came to me Darnell the Fidler, one of the
Duke’s house, and brought measet of lessons, all three parts. I
heard them play[ed] to the Duke of York this Christmas at his
lodgings, and bid him get me them. I did give him a Crowne for
715
them —and did enquire after the music of The Siege ofRhodes, which
he tells me he can get me, which I am mighty glad of. So to the
office, where among other things I read the Council’s order about
my Lord Brouncker and W. Penn to be assistants to the Controller
-
which quietly went down, with Sir
J.Mennes, poor man, seeming
a little as if he would be thought to have desired it, but yet
apparently to his discontent. And I fear, as the order runs, it will
hardly do much good. At noon to dinner; and there comes aletter
from Mrs. Pierce, telling me she will come and dine with us on
Thursday next with someof the players, Knipp, &c., which I was
glad of but my wife vexed, which vexed me but I seemed merry,
but know'not how to order the matter whether they shall come or
no. After dinner to the office and there late; doing much business;
and so home to supper and to bed.
