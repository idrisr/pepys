Upthis morning to put my papers in order that are come from
my Lord’s, so that now Ihave nothing there remaining that is mine,
which Ihave had till now. This morning came Mr. Goodgroome to
me, recommended by Mr. Mage. With whom | agreed presently to
give him 20s. entrance; which I then did, and 20s. a month more to
teach me to sing. And so we begun and I hope I shall come to
something in it. His first song is La cruda la bella. He gone, my
Brother Tom comes; with whom I made even with my father and
the two drapers for the cloths Isent to sea lately. At home all day. In
the afternoon came Capt. Ailen and his daughter Rebecca and Mr.
Hempson; and by and by both Sir Wms, who sat with me till it was
late. And I hada very gallant collacion for them. At night to bed.
