Up, and made myself as fine as I could with the Linning
stockings and wide Canons that I bought the other day at Hague.
Extraordinary press of Noble company and great mirth all the day.
At supper three Doctors of Physique at my Cabbin — where I put
Dr. Scarborough in mind of what I heard him say about the use of
the eyes. Which he owned, that children do in every day’s
experience look several ways with both their eyes, till custom
teaches them otherwise. And that we do now see with one eye— our
eyes looking in Paralell lynes.
