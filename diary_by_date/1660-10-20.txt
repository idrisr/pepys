This morning one came to me to advise with me where to
make me a window into my cellar in lieu of one that Sir W. Batten
had stopped up; and going down into my cellar to look, I put my
foot into a great heap of turds, by which I find that Mr. Turners
house of office is full and comes into my cellar, which doth trouble
me; but I will have it helped. To my Lord’s by land, calling at
87
several places about business. Where I dined with my Lord and
Lady; where he was very merry and did talk very high how he
would have a French Cooke and a Master of his Horse, and his lady
and child to wear black paches; which methought was strange, but
he is become a perfect Courtier; and among other things, my Lady
saying that she would have a good Merchant for her daughter Jem,
he answered that he would rather see her with a pedlar’s pack at her
back, so she married a Gentleman, rather then that she should
marry a Citizen. This afternoon, going through London and calling
at Crowes the upholster in Saint Bartholmew — I saw the limbs of
some of our new Traytors set upon Aldersgate, which was a sad
sight to see; and a bloody week this and the last have been, there
being ten hanged, drawn, and Quarterd. Home; and after writing a
letter to my Uncle by the post, I went to bed.
