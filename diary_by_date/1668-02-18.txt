Up by break of day; and walked down to the Old Swan,
where I find little Michell building, his Booth being taken down
and a foundation laid for a new house, so that that street is like to be
a very fine place. I drank, but did not see Betty. And so to Charing
cross stairs, and thence walked to Sir W. Coventry and talked with
him; who tells me how he hath been prosecuted, and how he is yet
well come off in the business of the dividing of the fleet and the
sending of the letter. He expects next to be troubled about the
business of bad officers in the fleet, wherein he will bid them name
whom they call bad and he will justify himself — having never
disposed of any but by the Admiral’s liking. And he is able to give
an account of all them, how they came recommended, and more
will be found to have been placed by the Prince and Duke of
Albemarle then by the Duke of York during the war. And as a no
bad instance of the badness of officers, he andI did look over the list
of commanders, and found that we could presently recollect 37
commanders that have been killed in actuall service this war.
Thence walked over St. James’s park to Whitehall; and thence to
Westminster hall and there walked all the morning and did speak
with several Parliament-men; among others, Birch, who is very
kind to me and calls me, with great respect and kindness, a man of
business, and he thinks honest; and so, long will stand by me and
every such man to the death. Here I did get a copy of the report
itself, about our paying off men by tickets; and am mightily glad to
see it now, knowing the state of our case and what we have to
answer to, and the more for that the House is like to be kept by
other business today and tomorrow; so that against Thursdy I
shall
be able to draw up some defence to put into some members’ hands
to inform them; and I think we may [make] a very good one, and
therefore my mind is mightily at ease about it.
