To Whitehall in hopes ofa meeting of Tanger, but it could not
be obtained. Walking here in the galleries, I find the Ladies of
Honour dressed in their riding garbs, with coats and doublets with
deep skirts, just for all the world like men, and buttoned their
doublets up the breast, with perriwigs and with hats; so that, only
for along petticoat dragging under their men’s coats, nobody could
take them for women in any point whatever — which was an odde
sight, and a sight did not please me. It was Mrs. Wells and another
fine lady that I saw thus.
