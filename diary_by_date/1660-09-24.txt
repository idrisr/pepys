office day. From thence to dinner by Coach with my wife to
my Cozen Scotts — and the company not being come, I went over
the way to the Barbers. So thither again to dinner, where was my
uncle Fenner and my aunt, my father and mother and others.
Among the rest, my Cozen Rich. Pepys, their elder brother, whom
I have not seen these fourteen years, ever since he came from New
England. I rose from table and went to the Temple church, where I
had appointed Sir W. Batten to meet him; and there at Sir Henige
Finch, Sollicitor-Generall’s Chamber, before him and Sir W.
Wilde, Recorder of London (whom we sent for from his chamber),
we were sworn Justices of Peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and
Southampton,’ with which Honour I did find my mind mightily
pleased, though I am wholly ignorant in the duty of a Justice of
Peace. From thence to my Lord’s to enquire whether they have had
anything from my Lord or no. Knocking at the door, there passed
by Monsieur L’impertinent, for whom I took a Coach and went
with him to a dancing-meeting in Broadstreete, at the house that
was formerly the Glasse house (Luke Channell Maister of the
Schoole) where I saw good dancing. But it growing late and the
room very full of people, and so very hott, I went home.
