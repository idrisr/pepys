Athome with my wife and Ashwell, talking of her going into
the country this year; wherein we had like to have fallen out, she
thinking that Ihavea design to have her go, which I have not; and to
let her stay here I perceive will not be convenient, for she expects
more pleasure then I can give her here, and I fear Ihave done very ill
in letting her begin to learn to dance.
