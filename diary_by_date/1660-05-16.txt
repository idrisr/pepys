This afternoon Mr. Ed. Pickering told me in what a sad, poor
condition for clothes and money the King was, and all his
attendants, when he came to him first from my Lord -their clothes
not being worth 4os., the best of them. And how overjoyed the
King was when Sir J. Greenville brought him some money; so
joyful, that he called the Princesse Royall and Duke of Yorke to
look upon it as it lay in the Portmanteau before it was taken out. My
Lord told me too, that the Duke of Yorke is made High Admirall of
England.
