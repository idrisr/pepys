Christmas Day. To church in the morning, and there saw a
wedding in the church, which I have not seen many a day, and the
young people so merry one with another; and strange, to see what
delight we married people have to see these poor fools decoyed into
our condition, every man and wife gazing and smiling at them.
Here I saw again my beauty Lethulier. Thence to my Lord
Brouncker by invitation, and dined there — and so home to my
lodgings to settle myself to look over and settle my papers, both of
my accounts private and those of Tanger, which I have let go so
long that it were impossible for any soul, had I died, to understand
them or ever come to any good end in them. I hope God will never
suffer me to come to that disorder again.
