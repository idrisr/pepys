To the office; and by and by word was brought me that
Comissioner Pett is brought to the Tower and there laid up close
prisoner — which puts me intoa fright, lest they may do the same

am doing with my people, and collecting out of my papers our
794

writing letters late; and then home to supper and to read myself
asleep, after piping; and so to bed.
