Upearly. Carried my Lord’s Will in a black box to Mr. Wm.
Mountagu for him to keep for him. Then to the Barbers and put on
my Cravatt there. So to my Lord again, who was almost ready to be
gone and had stayed for me. Hither came Gill. Holland, and
brought me a Stick-rapier, and Shelston a sugar-loaf; and had
brought his wife, which he said was a very pretty woman, to the
Ship tavern hard by for me to see, but I could not go. Young Reeve
also brought mealittle Perspective glasse which I bought for my
Lord; it cost me 8s. So after that my Lord in Sir H. Wrights coach
with Capt. Isham, and Mr. Tho. and John Crew with him. And I
and W. Howe in a Hackny to the Towre, where the barges stayed
for us. My Lord and the Captain in one, and W. How and J and Mr.
Ibbott and Mr. Burr in the other, to the Long Reach, where the
Swiftsure lay at Anchor (in our way we saw the great breach which
30
the late high water had made, to the loss of many tooo! to the people
about Limehouse). As soon as my Lord on board, the guns went off
bravely from the Ships; and a little while after comes the Vice-
admirall Lawson and seemed very respectful to my Lord, and so did
the rest of the Comanders of the frigates that were thereabouts. I to
the Cabbin allotted for me, which was the best that any had that
belonged to my Lord. I got out some things out of my chests for
writing, and to work presently, Mr. Burr and Iboth. Isupped at the
Deck table with Mr. Sheply. We were late, writing of orders for the
getting of ships ready, &c. After that to bed in my cabin, which was
but short; however, I made shift with it and slept very well; and the
weather being good, I was not sick at all; yet Iknow not whenI shall
be.
