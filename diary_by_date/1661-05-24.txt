Athomeall the morning making up my private accounts; and
this is the first time that I do find myself to be clearly worth so0ol in
money, besides all my goods in my house, &c. In the afternoon at
the office late. And then I went to the Wardrobe, where I find my
Lord at supper and therefore I walked a good while till he had done;
and then I went in to him, and there looked over my accounts and
they were committed to Mr. Moore to see me paid what remained
due to me. Then down to the Kitchin to eat a bit of bread and butter,
which I did. And there I took one of the maids by the chin, thinking
her to be Susan; but it proved to be her sister, which is very like her.
From thence home.
