Tomy Lord. One with me to buy a clerk’s place with me, and I
did demand 100l. To the Council chamber, where I took out an
order for the advance of the salaries of the officers of the Navy, andI
find mine to be raised to 350/ per annum. Thence to the Change,
where I bought two fine prints of Ragotts from Rubens; and
afterward dined with my uncle and Aunt Wight, where her sister
Con and her husband was. After that to Mr. Rawlinsons with my
uncle; and thence to the Navy Office, where I begin to take an
inventory of the papers and goods and books of the office. To my
Lord’s. Late writing letters. So home to bed.
