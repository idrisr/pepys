Up betimes, and to the office to write fair my paper for D.
Gawden against anon; and then to other business, where all the
morning. D. Gawden by and by comes, andI did read over and give
him the paper, which I think I have much obliged him in.A little
before noon comes my old good friend Mr. Rd. Cumberland to see
me, being newly come to town, whom I have not seen almost, if
not quite, these seven years — in his plain country-parson dress. I
could not spend much time with him, but prayed him come with
his brother, who was with him, to dine with me today; which he
did do and I had a great deal of his good company; and a most
excellent person he is as any I know, and one that I am sorry should
be lost and buried in a little country town, and would be glad to
remove him thence; and the truth is, if he would accept of my
sister’s fortune, Ishould give 1ool more with him then to a man able
to settle her four times as much asI fear he is able to do. And I will
think of it, and a way how to move it, he having in discourse said he
was not against marrying, nor yet engaged. I showed him my
closet, and did give him some very good music, Mr. Cesar being
here upon his Lute. They gone, I to the office, where all the
afternoon very busy. Anon Sir W. Penn came and talked with me in
the garden; and tells me that for certain the Duke of Richmond is to
marry Mrs. Stewart, he having this day brought in an account of his
estate and debts to the King on that account. At night home to
supper and so to bed. My father’s letter this day doth tell me of his
own continued illness, and that my mother grows so much worse
that he fears she cannot long continue — which troubles me much.
This day Mr. Cesar told mea pretty experiment ofhis, of Angling
with a Minikin, a gut-string varnished over, which keeps it from
swelling and is beyond any hair for strength and smallness — the
secret I like mightily.
