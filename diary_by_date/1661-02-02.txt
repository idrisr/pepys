There dined here my Uncle Wight and my aunt— my father and
mother and my brother Tom — Dr. Fairebrother and Mr. Mills the
parson and his wife, who is a neighbour’s daughter of my uncle
Robts. and knows my aunt Wight and all her and my friends there.
And so we have excellent company today. After dinner I was sent
for to Sir G. Carterets, where he was and I find the Comptroller;
who are upon writinga letter to the Comissioners of parliament; in
some things a rougher style then our last, because they seem to
speak high to us. So the Comptroller and I thence to a tavern hard
by, and there did agree upon drawing up some letters to be sent to
all the pursers and clerks of the Cheques to make up their accounts.
Then home, whereI find the parson and his wife gone — and by and
by the rest of the company, very well pleased, and I too — it being
the last dinner Ientend to make a great while. It having now cost me
almost 15/ in three dinners within this fortnight.
