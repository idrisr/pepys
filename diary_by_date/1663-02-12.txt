Up, and find myself pretty well; and so to the office and there
all the morning. Rise at noon and home to dinner — in my green
chamber, having a good fire — whither there came my wife’s
brother and brought Mary Ashwell with him, whom we finda very
likely person to please us both for person, discourse, and other
qualities. She dined with us, and after dinner went away again,
being agreed to come to us about three weeks or a month hence. My
wife and I well pleased with our choice, only I pray God I may be
able to maintain it.
