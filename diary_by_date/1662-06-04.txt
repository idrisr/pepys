Sir W. Batten and Iby water down to Woolwich and there saw
an experiment made of Sir R. Ford’s holland’s yarne (about which
we have lately had so much stir; and Ihave much concerned myself
for our Ropemaker, Mr. Hughes, who hath represented it as bad);
and we found it to be very bad, and broke sooner then, upon a
fair
triall, five threades of that against four of Riga yarn; and also that
some of it hath old Stuffe that hath been tarred, coverd over with
new hempe, which is sucha cheat as hath not been heard of. I was
glad of this discovery, because I would not have the King’s
workmen discouraged (as Sir W. Batten doth most basely do) from
representing the faults of merchants goods, when there is any.
