Lords day. Long in bed —till raised by my new Taylor, Mr.
Penny; comes and brings me my new velvet coat, very handsome
but plain; and a day hence will bring me my Camelott cloak. He
gone, I close to my papers to set all in order, and to perform my
vow to finish my Journall and other things before Ikiss any woman
more, or drink any wine, which I must be forced to do tomorrow if
I go to Greenwich, as I am invited by Mr. Boreman to hear Mrs.
Knipp sing. And I would be glad to go, so as we may be merry. At
noon eat the second of the two Cygnets Mr. Sheply sent us for a
New Year’s gift; and presently to my chamber again, and so to
work hard all day about my Tanger accounts, which I am going
again to make up — as also upon writing a letter to my father about
Pall, whom it is time now, I find, to think of disposing of, while
God Almighty hath given me something to give with her; and in
my letter to my father I do offer to give her 450l, to make her own
sol, given her by my uncle, up sool. I do also therein propose Mr.
Harman the upholster for a husband for her, to whom Ihavea great
love, and did heretofore love his former wife, and a civil man he is,
and careful in his way. Besides, I like his trade and place he lives in,
being Cornehill. Thus late at work; and so to supper and to bed.
