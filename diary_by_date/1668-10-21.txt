Lay pretty long, talking with content with my wife about our
coach and things; and so to the office, where Sir D. Gawden was to
do something in his accounts. At noon to dinner to Mr. Batelier’s,
his mother coming this day a’ house-warming to him, and several
friends of his, to which he invited us. Here mighty merry, and his
mother the same; I heretofore took her for a gentlewoman, and
understanding. I rose from table before the rest, because under an
obligation to go to my Lord Brouncker’s, where to meet several
gentlemen of the Royal Society to go and makea visit to the French
Embassador Colbert at Leicester house, he having endeavoured to
make one or two to my Lord Brouncker, as our President, but he
was not within. But I came too late, they being gone before; but I
fallowed to Leicester house, but they are gone in and up before me;
and so I away to the New Exchange and there stayed for my wife;
and she come, we to cow lane and there I showed her the coach
which I pitch on, and she is out of herself for joy almost; but the
man not within, so did nothing more towards an agreement; but to
Mr. Crow’s about a bed, to have his advice; and so home and there
had my wife to read to me, and so to supper and to bed.
Memorandum: that from Crows, we went back to Charing cross and
there left my people at their tailor’s while I to my Lord Sandwiches
lodgings, who came to town the last night and is come thither to hie
— and met with him within; and among others, my new Cosen
Creed, who looks mighty soberly; and he andI salute one another
with mighty gravity, till we came to alittle more freedom of talk
about it. But here Ihear that Sir Gilb. Pickering is lately dead, about
three days since, which makes some sorrow there; though not
much, because of his being long expected to die, having been in a
Lethargy long. So waited on my Lord to Court, and there stayed
and saw the ladies awhile; and thence to my wife and took them up;
and so home and to supper and bed.
