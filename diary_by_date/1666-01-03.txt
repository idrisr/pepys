Up, and all the morning till 3 in the afternoon examining and
fitting up my pursers’ paper, and so sent it away by an express.
Then comes my wife, andI set her to get supper ready against I go
to the Duke of Albemarle; and back again — and at the Dukes, with
great joy, I received the good news of the decrease of the plague this
week to 70, and but 253 in all; which is the least Bill hath been
known these twenty years in the City — though the want of people
in London is it that must make it so low, below the ordinary
number for Bills. So home, and find all my good company I had
bespoke, as, Coleman and his wife and Laneare, Knipp, and her
surly husband. And good music we had, and among other things,
Mrs. Coleman sang my words I set of Beauty retire, and I think it is a
good song and they praise it mightily. Then to dancing and supper,
and mighty merry till Mr. Rolt came in, whose pain of the
Toothake made him no company and spoilt ours; so he away, and
then my wife’s teeth fell of akeing, and she to bed; so forced to break
up all with a good song, and so to bed.
