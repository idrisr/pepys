Up, with a sad heart in reference to my mother, of whose
death I do undoubtedly expect to hear the next post, if not of my
father’s also, who, by his pain as well as his grief for her, is very ill.
But on my own behalf, I have cause tobe joyful this day, as being
my usual feast-day for my being cutof the stone this day nine years;
and through God’s blessing am at this day and have long been in as
good condition of health as ever I was in my life, or any man in
England is, God make me thankful for it. But the condition I am in
in reference to my mother makes it unfit for me to keep my usual
feast, unless it should please God to send her well (which I despair
wholly of); and then Iwill make amends for it by observing another
day in its room.
