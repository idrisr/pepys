Whitsunday. Lords day. Lay long, talking with my wife,
sometimes angry; and ended pleased and hope to bring our matters
to a better posture ina
little time, which God send. So up and to
church, where Mr. Mills preached; but I know not how, I slept
most of the sermon. Thence home and dined with my wife and
Ashwell and after dinner discoursed very pleasantly; and so I to
church again in the afternoon. And the Scott preaching again, slept
all the afternoon.
