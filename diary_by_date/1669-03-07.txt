Lords day. Up and to the office, busy till church time; and then
to church, where a dull sermon; and so home to dinner all alone
with my wife, and then to even my journall to this day; and then to
the Tower to see Sir W. Coventry, who had H. Jermin and a great
many more with him, and more, while I was there, came in; so that
I do hear that there was not less then 60 coaches there yesterday and
the other day — which I hear also, that there is a great exception
taken at by the King and the Duke of Buckingham, but it cannot be
helped.
