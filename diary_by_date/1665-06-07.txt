This day, much against my Will, I did in Drury lane see two or
three houses marked with a red cross upon the doors, and ‘“‘Lord
have mercy upon us”’ writ there — which was a sad sight to me,
being the first of that kind that to my remembrance I ever saw. It
put me into an ill conception of myself and my smell, so that I was
forced to buy some roll tobacco to smell to and chaw — which took
away the apprehension.
