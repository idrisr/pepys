Lords day. Up, and to my chamber to set some papers in order;
and then to church, where my old acquaintance, that dull fellow
Meriton, made a good sermon; and hatha strange knack ofa grave,
serious delivery, which is very agreeable. After church, to
Whitehall and there find Sir G. Carteret just sat down to dinner; and
Idined with them as Ientended, and good company, the best people
and family in the world I think. Here was great talk of the good end
that my Lord Treasurer made; closing his own eyes and setting his
mouth, and bidding Adieu with the greatest content and freedom in
the world; and is said to die with the cleanest hands that ever any
Lord Treasurer did. After dinner, Sir G. Carteret and I alone; and
there among other discourse, he did declare that he would be
content to part with his place of Treasurer of the Navy upon good
terms. I did propose my Lord Bellasses as a man likely to buy it;
which he listened to, and I did fully concur and promote his design
of parting with it, for though I would have my father live, I would
not have him die Treasurer of the Navy, because of the accounts
which must be uncleared at his death; besides many other
circumstances making it advisable for him to let it go. I took leave
of him, and directly by water home; and there to read the Life of
Mr. Hooker, which pleases me as much as anything I have read a
great while; and by and by comes Mr. How to see us, and after him
a little, Mr. Sheply, and so we all to talk; and Mercer being there,
we some of us to sing and so to supper; a great deal of silly talk;
among other things, W. How told us how the barristers and
students of Grays Inne rose in rebellion against the Benchers the
other day; who outlawed them, anda great deal of do but now they
772
are at peace again. They being gone, I to my book again and made
an end of Mr. Hooker’s Life, and so to bed.
