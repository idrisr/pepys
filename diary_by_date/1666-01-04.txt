Up, and to the office— where my Lord Brouncker andI (against
Sir W. Batten and Sir
J.Mennes and the whole table) for Sir W.
Warren in the business of his mast contract, and overcame them and
got them to do what I had a mind to; endeed, my Lord being
unconcerned in what I aimed at: So home to dinner, where Mr.
Sheldon came by invitation from Woolwich; and as merry as |
could be, with all my thoughts about me, and my wife still in pain
of her teeth. He anon took leave and took Mrs. Barbary his niece
home with him, and seems very thankful to me for the rol Idid give
him for my wife’s rent of his house; and I am sure I am beholding to
him, for it was a great convenience to me. And then my wife home
to London by water, andI to the office till 8 at night; and so to my
Lord Brouncker, thinking to have been merry, having appointed a
meeting for Sir
J.Mennes and his company and Mrs. Knipp again;
but whatever hindered I know not, but no company came, which
vexed me, because it disappointed me of the glut of mirth I hoped
for. However, good discourse with my Lord, and merry with Mrs.
Williams’s descants upon Sir J. Mennes and Mrs. Turner’s not
coming; so home and to bed.
