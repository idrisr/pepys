Upand to the office, where all the morning, and thence after to
dinner to the King’s playhouse and there in an upper box (where
came in Coll. Poynton and Doll Stacy, who is very fine, and by her
wedding ring I suppose he hath married her at last) did see The
Moore of Venice, but ill acted in most parts; Moone (which dida
little
surprize me) not acting Iago’s part by much so well as Clun used to
do, nor another Hart’s, which was Cassio’s; nor endeed Burt doing
the Moor’s so well as Ionce thought he did. Thence home, and just
at Holburne Conduit the bolt broke that holds the fore-wheels to
the perch, and so the horses went away with them and left the
985
coachman and us; but being near our coach-makers, and we staying
in a little ironmonger’s shop, we were presently supplied with
another; and'so home and there to my letters at the office, and so to
supper and to bed.
