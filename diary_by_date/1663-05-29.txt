This day is kept strictly as a holyday, being the King’s
Coronacion. We lay long in bed. And it rained very hard, rain and
281
hail almost all the morning. By and by Creed and I abroad and
called at several churches; and it is a wonder to see, and by that to
guess, the ill temper of the City at this time, either to religion in
general or to the King, that in some churches there was hardly ten
people in the whole church, and those poor people.
