At the office all the morning, where Mr. Wren first tells us of
the order from the King, come last night to the Duke of York, for
signifying his pleasure to the Sollicitor generall for drawing up a
commission for suspending of my Lord Anglesy and putting in Sir
Tho. Littleton and Sir Tho. Osborne (the former a creature of
Arlington’s, and the latter of the Duke of Buckingham’s) during the
suspension. The Duke of York was forced to obey, and did grant it,
he being to go to Newmarket this day with the King, and so the
King pressed for it. But Mr. Wren doth own that the Duke of York
is the most wounded in this in the world, for it is done and
concluded without his privity, after his appearing for him—and that
it is plain that they do ayme to bring the Admiralty into
commission too, and lessen the Duke of York. This doth put
strange apprehensions into all our Board; only, Ithink I am the least
troubled at it, for I care not at all for it— but my Lord Brouncker and
952
Pen do seem to think much of it. So home to dinner, full of this
news; and after dinner to the office, and so home all the afternoon to
do business towards my drawing up an account for the Duke of
York of the answers of this office to his late great letter, and late at it;
and so to bed, with great peace from my wife and quiet, Ibless God.
