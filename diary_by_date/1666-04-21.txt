Up betimes and to the office, there to prepare some things
against the afternoon, for discourse about the business of the
pursers and settling the pursers’ matters of the fleet according to my
proposition. By and by the office sat; and they being up, I continued
at the office to finish my matters against the meeting before the
609
Duke this afternoon; so home about 3 to clap a bit of meat in my
mouth, and so away with Sir W. Batten to Whitehall — and there to
the Duke;. but he being to go abroad to take the ayre, he dismissed
us presently -- without doing anything till tomorrow morning. So
my Lord Brouncker and I down to walk in the garden, it being a
mighty hot and pleasant day; and there was the King, who, among
others, talked to us a little; and among other pretty things, he swore
merrily that he believed the Ketch that Sir W. Batten bought the last
year at Colchester was of his own getting, it was so thick to its
length. Another pleasant thing he said of Chr. Pett, commending
him that he will not alter his moulds of his ships upon any man’s
advice (“‘as’’, says he, ‘““Comissioner Taylor, I fear,doth of his New
London, that he makes it differ, in hopes of mending the Old London,
built by him): for,” says he, “‘he finds that God hath put him into
the right, and so will keep in it while he is in. And,” says the King,
“I am sure it must be God put him in, for no art of his own ever
could have done it’’ — for it seems he cannot give a good account of
what he doth as an Artist.
