Up, and walked, with some Captains and others talking to me,
to Greenwich — they crying out upon Capt. Teddiman’s manage-
ment of the business of Bergen; that he stayed treating too long
while he saw the Dutch fitting themselfs. And that at first he might
have taken every ship and done what he would with them. How
true I cannot tell. Here we sat very late, and for want of money
(which lies heavy upon us) did nothing of business almost. Thence
home with my Lord Brouncker to dinner, where very merry with
him and his Doxy. After dinner comes Coll. Blunt in his new
Charriott made with Springs, as that was of Wicker wherein a while
since we rode at his house. And he hath rode, he says, now this
Journy, many mile in it with one horse, and outdrives any coach
$21
and out-goes any horse, and so easy he says. So for Curiosity Iwent
into it to try it; and up the hill to the Heath and over the Cartrutts
went to try it, and found it pretty well, but not so easy as he
pretends; and so back again and took leave of my Lord and drove
myself in the chariot to the office — and there ended my letters; and
home pretty betimes, and there find W. Pen, and he stayed supper
with us, and mighty merry talking of his Travells and the French
humours, &c; and so parted and to bed.
