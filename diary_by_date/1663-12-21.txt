Being directed by sight of bills upon the walls, did go to
Shooe lane to see a Cocke-fighting at a new pit there — a sport I was
never at in my life. But Lord, to see the strange variety of people,
from Parliament-man (by name Wildes, that was Deputy-governor
of the Tower when Robinson was Lord Mayor) to the poorest
prentices, bakers, brewers, butchers, draymen, and what not; and
all these fellows one with another in swearing, cursing, and betting.
I soon had enough ofit; and yet I would not but have seen it once, it
being strange to observe the nature of those poor creatures, how
they will fight till they drop down dead upon the table and strike
after they are ready to give up the ghost — not offering to run away
when they are weary or wounded past doing further. Whereas,
where a Dunghill brood comes, he will, after a sharp stroke that
pricks him, run off the stage, and then they wring off his neck
without more ado. Whereas the other they preserve, though their
eyes be both out, for breed only of
a true cock of the game. One
thing more it is strange to see, how people of this poor rank, that
look as if they had not bread to put in their mouths, shall bet 3 or 4/
at one bet and lose it, and yet bet as much the next battell, as they
call every make of two cocks —so that one of them will lose ro or 20l
at a meeting. Thence, having enough of it, by coach to my Lord
Sandwiches; where I find him within with Capt. Cooke and his
boys, Dr. Childe, Mr. Mage, and Mallard, playing and singing
over my Lord’s Anthemne which he hath made to sing in the King’s
Chappell. My Lord saluted me kindly and took me into the
withdrawing-room to hear it at a distance; and endeed, it sounds
333
very finely and is a good thing, I believe, to be made by him — and
they all commend it. And after that was done, Capt. Cooke and his
two boys did sing some Italian songs, which I must in a word say I
think was fully the best Musique that I ever yet heard in all my life.
