with him at Wilkinsons, and my Brother Spicer. After that to
Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the 7ths chapel heard part of a
sermon, the first that ever I heard there. To my Lord’s and dined all
alone at the table with him. My wife at home all this day, she having
no clothes out, all being packed up yesterday. For this month Ihave
wholly neglected anything of news, and so have beyond belief been
ignorant how things go. And now, by my patent, my mind is in
some quiet; which God keep. I was not at my father’s tonight, I
being afeared to go for fear he should still solicit me to speak to my
Lord fora place in the Wardrobe, which Idare not do because of my
own business yet. My wife and I mightily pleased with our new
house that we hope to have.
