With my Lord to Whitehall all the morning. I spoke with Mr.
Coventry about my business, who promised me all the assistance I
could expect. At the Leg in King street. Thence to the Admiralty,
56
where I met with Mr. Turner of the Navy Office, who did look
after the place of Clerk of the Acts. He was very civil to me and I to
him, and shall be so. There came a letter from my Lady Monke to
my Lord about it this evening. But he refused to come to her; but
meeting in Whitehall with Sir Tho. Clerges, her brother, my Lord
returned answer that he would not desist in my business. And that
he believed that Gen. Monke would take it ill if my Lord should
name the officers in his army. And therefore he desired to have the
naming ofone officer in the fleet. At Dorsett house I met with Mr.
Kipps my old friend, with whom the world is well changed, he
being now seal-bearer to the Lord Chancellor, at which my wife
and I are very well pleased, he being a very good-natured man.
Home, and late writing letters. Then to my Lord’s lodgings, this
being the first night of his coming to Whitehall to lie since his
coming from sea.
