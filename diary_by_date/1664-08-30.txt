Up and to the office, where sat long; and at noon to dinner at
home. After dinner comes Mr. Pen to visit me, and stayed an hour
talking with me. Iperceive something of learning he hath got, but a
great deal, if not too much, of the vanity of the French garbe and
affected manner of speech and gait — I fear all real profit he hath
made of his travel will signify little. So he gone, I to my office and
there very busy till late at night; and so home to supper and to bed.
