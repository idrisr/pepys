After dinner, by water to Whitehall, where the Duke of York
did meet our Office and went with us to the Lord Commissioners
of the Treasury; and there we did go over all the business of the state
I had drawn up, of this year’s action and expense; whichI did do to
their satisfaction, and convincing them of the necessity of provid-
ing more money, if possible, for us. Thence, the Duke of York
being gone, I did there stay walking with Sir H. Cholmly in the
Court, talking of news; where he told me that now the great design
of the Duke of Buckingham is to prevent the meeting, since he
cannot bring about with the King the dissolving, of this Parliament,
that the King may not need it; and therefore my Lord St. Albans is
hourly expected, with great offers ofa million of money, to buy our
breach with the Dutch; and this they do think may tempt the King
to take the money, and thereby be out of a necessity of calling the
Parliament again — which these people dare not suffer to meet again.
But this he doubts, and so do I, that it will be to the ruin of the
nation ifwe fall out with Holland. This we were discoursing, when
my boy comes to tell me that his mistress was at the gate with the
coach; whither I went and there find my wife and the whole
1012
company; so she and Mrs. Turner and The[oph]. and Talbot in
mine, and Joyce, W. Batelier, and I in a hackney to Hyde park,
where I was ashamed to be seen; but mightily pleased, though
troubled with a drunken coachman that did not remember, when
we came to light, where it was he took us up; but said at
Hammersmith, and thither he was carrying of us when we came
first out of the Park. So I carried them all to Hercules Pillars and
there did treat them; and'so about 10 at night parted, and my wife
and I and W. Batelier home; and he gone, we to bed.
