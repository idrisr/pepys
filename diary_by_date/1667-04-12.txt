Up; and when ready, I to my office to doa
little business; and
coming homeward again, saw my door and hatch open, left so by
Luce our cookmaid; which so vexed me, that I did give her a kick in
our entry and offered a blow °t her, and was seen doing so by Sir W.
Penn’s footboy, which did vex me to the heart because | know he
will be telling their family of it, though Idid put on presently a very
pleasant face to the boy and spoke kindly to him as one without
passion, so as it may be he might not think Iwas angry; but yet Iwas
troubled at it. I close at my office all the afternoon, getting off of
hand my papers, which by the late holidays and my laziness were

grown too many upon my hands, to my great trouble; and
therefore at it as late as my eyes would give me leave; and then by
water down to Redriffe, meaning to meet my wife, who is gone
with Mercer, Barker, and the boy (it being most sweet weather) to
walk; and I did meet with them and walked back, and then by the
time we got home it was dark, and we stayed singing in the garden
till supper was ready, and there with great pleasure. But I tried my
girls, Mercer and Barker singly, one after another, a single song, At
dead low Ebb, &c.; andI do clearly find that as to manner ofsinging,
the latter doth much the better, the other thinking herself, as I do
myself, above taking pains for a manner of singing, contenting
ourselfs with the judgment and goodnessofeare. So to supper, and
then parted and to bed.
