Up, and by water to Whitehall, where the Court full of
waggons and people ready to go out of town. The Mortality bill is
come to 267 — which is about 90 more then the last; and of these,
~ but 4 in the City — which is a great blessing to us. So home, calling
at Somersett house, where all are packing up too; the Queene-
mother setting out for France this day to drink Bourbon waters
this year, she being in a consumption — and entends not to come till
winter come twelvemonths. To the office, where busy a while,
putting some things in my office in order, and then to letters till
night. About 10 a-clock home — the days being sensibly shorter:
before, I have once kept a summer’s day by shutting up office by
daylight, but my life hath been still as it was in winter almost. But I
will for a month try what I can do by daylight. So home to supper
and to bed.
