Up, pretty well, the weather being become pretty warm
again. And to the office, where we sat all the morning; and |
confess, having received so lately a token from Mrs. Russell, I did
find myself concerned for our not buying some tallow of her
(which she bought on purpose yesterday most unadvisedly, to her
great loss, upon confidence ofputting itoff to us); so hard it is for a
man not to be warped against his duty and maister’s interest that
receives any bribe or present, though not as a bribe, from anybody
else. But she must be contented and I, to do her a good turn when
I can without wrong to the King’s service. Thence to St. Paul’s
churchyard to my booksellers; and having gained this day in the
office, by my stationer’s bill to the King, about 4os. or 31, I did here
sit two or three hours, calling for twenty books to lay this money
out upon; and found myself at a great loss where to choose, and do
329
see how my nature would gladly returne to the laying out of money
in this trade. Icould not tell whether to lay out my money for books
of pleasure, as plays, which my nature was most earnest in; but at
last, after seeing Chaucer — Dugdales History of Pauls, Stow’s
London, Gesner, History ofTrent, besides Shakespeare, Johnson, and
Beaumonts plays, I at last chose Dr. Fuller’s worthys, the Cabbala or
collections ofLetters of State — anda little book, Delices de Hollande,
with another little book or two, all of good use or serious pleasure;
and Hudibras, both parts, the book now in greatest Fashion for
drollery, though I cannot, I confess, see enough where the wit lies.
My mind being thus settled, I went by link home; and so to my
office and to read in Rushworth; and so home to supper and to bed.
