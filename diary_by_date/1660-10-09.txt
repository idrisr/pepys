This morning, Sir W. Batten with Coll. Birch to Deptford to
pay off two ships. Sir W. Pen and I stayed to do business, and
afterward together to Whitehall, where I went to my Lord and
found him in bed not well. And saw in his chamber his picture, very
well done; and am with child till I get it copyed out, which I hope to
do when he is gone to sea. To Whitehall again, where at Mr.
Coventrys chamber I met with Sir W. Pen again, and so with him to
Redriffe by water and from thence walked over the fields to
Deptford (the first pleasant walk I have had a great while); and in
our way had a great deal of merry discourse, and find him to be a
merry fellow and pretty good-natured and sings very bawdy songs.
About noon we dined together and were very merry at table, telling
of tales. After dinner to the pay of another ship till 10 at night. And
so home in our barge, a clear Mooneshine night and it was 12 a-
clock before we got home — where I find my wife in bed and part of
our chambers hung today by the Upholster; but not being well
done, I was fretted, and so in a discontent to bed.
