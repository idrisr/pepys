Up betimes this morning; and after the Barber had done with
me, then to the office, where I and Sir W. Penn only did meet and
despatch business. At noon my wife and Iby coach to Dr Clerkes to
dinner. I was very much taken with his lady, a comely, proper
woman (though not handsome); but a woman of the best language
68
that ever I heard any in my life. Here dined Mrs. Pierce and her
husband.
