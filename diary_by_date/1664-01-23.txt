Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon
home to dinner, where Hawly came to see us and dined with us.
And after we had dined came Mr. Mallard; and after he had eat
something, Ibrought down my vyall, which he played on-the first
Maister that ever touched her yet, and she proves very well and will
be, I think, an admirable instrument. He played some very fine
things of his own, but I was afeared to enter too far in their
commendation for fear he should offer to copy them for me out,
and so I be forced to give or lend him something. So to the office in
1. Convicted of the robbery described above, p. 342 (8 January).
344
the evening, whither Mr. Comander came to me and we discoursed
about my Will, which I am resolved to perfect the next week by the
grace of God. He being gone, I to write letters and other business
late. And so home to supper and to bed.
