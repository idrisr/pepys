Up and to the Committee of Tanger, where little done. And
thence Ihome by my own coach, and busy after dinner at my office,
all the afternoon till late at night, that my eyes were tired. So home,
and my wife showed me many excellent prints of Nantueil’s and
others, which W. Batelier hath at my desire brought me out of
France of the King’s and Colberts and others, most excellent, to my
great content. But he hath also brought over a great many gloves
perfumed, of several sorts; but all too big by half for her, and yet she
will have two or three dozen of them, which vexed me and made
me angry; so she at last, to please me, did come to take what alone |
thought fit; which pleased me. So aftera
little supper, to bed — my
eyes being very bad.
