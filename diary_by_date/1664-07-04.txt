Up, and many people with me about business; and then out to
several places, and so at noon to my Lord Crews and there dined,
and very much made on there by him. He offered me the selling of
some landof his in Cambrigeshire, a purchase of about 1000] — and
if I can compass it, I will. After dinner I walked homeward, still
doing business by the way, and at home find my wife this day of
her own accord to have lain out 25s. upon a pair of pendances for
her eares; which did vex me and brought both me and her to very
high, and very foul words from her to me, such as trouble me to
think she should have in her mouth, and reflecting upon our old
401
differences,! which I hate to have remembered. I vowed to break
them, or that she should go and get what she could for them again. I
went with that resolution out of doors. The poor wretch afterward,
in a little while, did send out to change them for her money again. I
fallowed Besse her messenger at the Change and there did consult
and sent her back; I would not have them changed, being satisfied
that she yielded. So went home, and friends again as to that
business; but the words I could not get out of my mind, and so went
to bed at night discontented; and she came to bed to me, but all
would not make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning
angry. This day the King and the Queenes went to visit my Lord
Sandwich and the fleet going forth, in the Hope.
