Up earely and to Mr. Moore, and thence to Mr. Lovell about
my law businesses, and from him to Pauls schoole, it being
opposicion-day there. Iheard some of their speeches, and they were
just as schoolboys used to be, of the seven Liberall Sciences; but I
think not so good as ours were in our time. Mr. Crumlum did me
much honour by telling many what a present I had made to the
school, showing my Stephanus in four volumes, cost me 4l Ios.
Thence with Mr. Elborough (he being all of my old acquaintance
that I could meet with here) to a Cookes shop to dinner, but I find
him a fool as he ever was, or worse. Thence to my Cosen Roger
Pepys and Mr. Phillips about my law businesses, which stand very
bad. And so home to the office; where after doing some business, I
went home, where Ifind our new mayd Mary, that is comein Janes
place.
