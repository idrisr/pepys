Lord Mayors day. Entended to have made me fine and by
invitation to have dined with my Lord Mayor today; but going to
see Sir Wm. Batten this morning, I find Sir G. Carteret andSirJ.
Mennes going with Sir W. Batten and myself to examine Sir G.
Carteret’s accounts for the last year; whereuponIsettled to it with
them all the day long, only dinner time (which Sir George gave us);
and by night did as good as finish them.
