By coach to Whitehall with Coll. Slingsby (carrying Mrs.
Turner with us); and there he and I into the House, where we met
with Sir G. Cartret — who afterward, with the Duke of Yorke, my
Lord Sandwich, and others, went into a private room to consult.
And we werealittle troubled that we were not called in with the
rest. But I do believe it was upon something very private. We
stayed walking in the galery, where we met with Mr. Slingsby, that
was formerly a great friend of Monsieur Blondeau’s — who showed
me the stamps of the King’s new coyne; which is strange to see how
good they are in the stamp and bad in the mony, for lack of skill to
make them. But he says Blondeau will shortly come over and then
we shall have it better, and the best in the world. The Controller
and I to the Comissioners of Parliament; and after some talk, away
again — and to drink a cup of ale. He tells me he is sure that the King
is not yet married, as it is said; nor that itis known who he will have.
To my Lord’s and found him dined; and so I lost my dinner. But I
stayed and played with him and Mr. Childe &c., some things of
four partes; and so it raining hard and bitter cold (the first winter
day we have yet had this winter), I took coach home and spent the
evening in reading ofa Latin play, the Naufragium joculare. And so to
bed.
