After dinner with my wife to the King’s house, to see The
Mayden Queene, a new play of Dryden’s mightily commended for
the regularity of it and the strain and wit; and the truth is, there is a
comical part done by Nell, which is Florimell, that Inever can hope
ever to see the like done again by man or woman. The King and
Duke of York was at the play; but so great performance of a comical
part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell doth this, both
as a mad girle and then, most and bestofall, when she comes in like
a young gallant; and hath the motions and carriage of a spark the
most that ever I saw any man have. It makes me, I confess, admire
her. Thence home and to the office, where busy a while; and then
home to read the lives of Henry the sth and 6th, very fine, in
Speede; and so to bed.
