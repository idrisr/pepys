Tomy Lord, where much business and some hopes of getting
some money thereby. With him to the parliament house, where he
did entend to have gone to have made his appearance today, but he
met Mr. Crew upon the stairs and would not go in. To the
Admiralty and so to my Lord’s lodgings, where he told me that he
did look after the place of the Clerk of the Acts for me. So to Mr.
Crews and my father’s and to bed. My wife went this day to
Huntsmoore for her things, and I was very lonely all night. This
evening my wife’s brother Balty came to me to let me know his bad
SS
condition and to get a place for him, but I perceive he stands upon a
place for a gentleman that may not stain his family; when, God help
him, he wants bread.
