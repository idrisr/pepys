All day before dinner with Creed, talking of many things;
among others, of my Lord’s going so often to Chelsy; and he,
without my speaking much, doth tell me that his daughters do
perceive all and do hate the place and the young woman there, Mrs.
Betty Becke — for my Lord, who sent them thither only for a
disguise for his going thither, will come under pretence to see them,
and pack them out of doors to the park and stay behind with her.
But now the young ladies are gone to their mother to Kensington.
To dinner. And after dinner, till 10 at night in my study, writing of
my old broken office-notes in shorthand all in one book, till my
eyes did ake, ready to drop out. So home to supper and to bed.
