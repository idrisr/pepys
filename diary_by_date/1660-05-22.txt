News brought that the two Dukes are coming on board,
which, by and by they did in a Duch boat, the Duke of Yorke in
yellow trimming, the Duke of Gloucester in gray and red. My Lord
went in a boat to meet them, the Captain, myself, and others
standing at the entering Port. So soon as they were entered we shot
the guns off round the fleet. After that, they went to view the ship
all over and were most exceedingly pleased with it. They seem to be
both very fine Gentlemen. After that done, upon the Quarter-Deck
table under the awning, the Duke of Yorke and my Lord, Mr.
Coventree and I spent an houre at allotting to every ship their
service in their return to England; which having done, they went to
dinner, where the table was very full — the two Dukes at the upper
end, my Lord Opdam next on one side, and my Lord on the other.
After dinner, the Dukes and my Lord to see the Vice- and Rere-
Admirall; and I in a boat after them. After that done, they made to
the shore in the Duch boat that brought them, and I got into the
boat with them. But the shore was so full of people to expect their
48
coming as that it was black (which otherwise is white sand) as
everyone would stand by another. When we came near the shore,
my Lord left them and came into his own boat, and Gen. Pen and I
with him — my Lord being very well pleased with this day’s work.
By the time we came on board again, news is sent us that the King is
on shore; so my Lord fired all his guns round twice, and all the fleet
after him; which in the end fell into disorder, which seemed very
handsome. The gun over against my Cabbin I fired myself to the
King, which was the first time that he hath been saluted by his own
ships since this change. But holding my head too much over the
gun, I have almost spoiled my right eye. Nothing in the world but
going of guns almost all this day. In the evening we begun to
remove Cabbins; I to the Carpenters Cabbin and Dr. Clerke with
me.
