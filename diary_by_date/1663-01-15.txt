Up, and to my office preparing things. By and by we met and
sat, Mr. Coventry and I, till noon. Then I took him in to dine with
me, I having a wild goose roasted and a cold chine of beef and a
barrel of oysters. We dined alone in my chamber, and then he and I
to fit ourselfs for horseback, he having brought me a horse; and so
to Debtford, the ways being very dirty. There we walked up and
down the yard and wet-dock and did our main business, which was
to examine the proof of our new way of the Call-bookes, which we
think will be of great use. And so to horse again and Ihome with his
horse, leaving him to go over the fields to Lambeth — his boy at my
house taking home his horse. I vexed, having left my key in my
other pocket in my chamber and my door is shut, so that I was
forced to set my boy in at the window; which done, I shifted
myself, and so to my office till late.
