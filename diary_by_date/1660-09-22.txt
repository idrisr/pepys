This morning I called up the boy to me and find him a pretty
well-looked boy, and one that I think will please me. I went this
morning to Westminster by land along with Luellin. We walked on
to Fleetstreete, where at Mr. Standings in Salsbury court we drank
our morning draught and had a pickled herring. Among other
discourse here, he told me how the pretty woman that I always
loved at the beginning of Cheapeside that sells children’s coates was
served by the Lady Bennett (a famous Strumpet), who by
counterfeiting to fall into a swoune upon the sight of her in her
shop, became acquainted with her and at last got her ends of her to
lie with a gallant that had hired her to Procure this poor soul for
him. To Westminster to my Lord’s; and there in the house of office
vomited up all my breakfast, my stomach being ill all this day by
reason of the last night’s debauch. And stayed here all day in my
Lord’s chamber and upon the leads gazing upon Diana, who looked
out at a window upon me. At last I went out to Mr. Harpers, and
she standing over the way at the gate, I went over to her and
appointed to meet tomorrow in the afternoon at my Lord’s. Here I
bought a hanging jack. From thence by coach home (by the way at
the New Exchange I bought a pair of Short black stockings to wear
over a pair of silk ones for mourning; and here Imet with The[oph].
Turner and Joyce buying of things to go into mourning too for the
Duke, which is now the mode of all the ladies in towne), where I
writ some letters by the post to Hinchingbrooke to let them know
that this day Mr. Edwd. Pickering is come from my Lord and says
that he left him well in Holland and that he will be here within three
or four days. To bed, not well of my last night’s drinking yet. I had
the boy up tonight for his sister to teach him to put me to bed, and I
heard him read, which he doth pretty well.
