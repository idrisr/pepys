To the Coffee club and heard very good discourse; it was in
answer to Mr. Harrington’s answer, who said that the state of the
Roman government was not a settled government, and so it was no
wonder that the balance of propriety was in one hand and the
command in another, it being therefore always in a posture of war;
but it was carried by Ballat that it was a steady government;
though, it is true by the voices, it had been carried before that it was
an unsteady government. So tomorrow it is to be proved by the
opponents that the balance lie in one hand and the government in
another.
