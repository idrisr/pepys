Up, and betimes to the Old Swan and by water to Whitehall;
and thence to W. Coventry, where stayed buta little to talk with
him and thence by water back again, it being a mighty fine, clear
Spring morning. Back to the Old Swan and drank at Michells,
whose house goes up apace, but I could not see Betty; and thence
walked all along Thames street, which I have not done since it was
burned, as far as Billings gate and there do see a brave street likely to
be, many brave houses being built, and of them a great many by
Mr. Jaggard. But the raising of the street will make it mighty fine.
So to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon home to
dinner; and thence to the office, very busy till 5 a-clock; and then to
ease my eyes I took my wife out and Deb to the Change, and there
bought them some things; and so home again and to the office,
ended my letters, and so home to readalittle more in last night’s
book’ with much sport, it being a foolish book. And so to supper
and to bed.
