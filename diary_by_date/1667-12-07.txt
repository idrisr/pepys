Allthe morning at the office, and at noon home to dinner with
my clerks. And while we were at dinner comes Willett’s aunt to see
her and my wife. She is a very fine widow and pretty handsome,
but extraordinary well-carriaged and speaks very handsomely and
with extraordinary understanding, so as I spent the whole after-
noon in her company with my wife, she understanding all the
things of note touching plays and fashions and Court and
everything, and speaks rarely, which pleases me mightily, and
seems to love her niece very well, and was so glad (which was
pretty odde) to see that since she came hither her breasts begin to
swell, she being afeared before that she would have none — which
was a pretty kind of content she gave herself. She tells us that Catelin
is likely to be soon acted; which I am glad to hear — but it is at the
King’s House. But the King’s House is at present, and hath for
some days been, silenced upon some difference [between] Heart
and Moone. She being gone, I to the office and there late doing
853
business; and so home to supper and to bed. Somebody told me this
day that they hear that Thompson with the wooden leg, and
Wildman the Fifth-Monarchy man (a great creature of the Duke of
Buckinghams) are in nomination to be commissioners,' among
other, upon the Bill of Accounts.
