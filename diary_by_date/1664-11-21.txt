Up; and to the Lords at Whitehall, where they do single me
out to speak to and to hear — much to my content. And received
their commands perticularly in several businesses. Thence by their
order to the Atturny Generall’s about a new warrant for Capt.
Taylor, which I shall carry for him to be Comissioner, in spite of Sir
W. Batten; and yet endeed, it is not I, but the ability of the man,
443
that makes the Duke and Mr. Coventry stand by their choice. I to
Change and there stayed long, doing business. And this day for
certain, news is come that Teddiman hath brought in 18 or 20
Duchmen, merchants, their Burdeaux fleet, and two men of war to
Portsmouth. And Ihad letters this afternoon that three are brought
into the Downes and Dover — so that the war is begun: God give a
good end to it. After dinner at home all the afternoon, busy; and at
night with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Mennes looking over the
business of stating the accounts of the Navy charge to my Lord
Treasurer, where Sir J. Mennes’s paper served us in no stead
almost, but was all false; and after I had done it with great pains, he
being by, Iam confident he understands not one word init. Atit till
Io at night almost. Thence by coach to Sir Ph. Warwickes by his
desire, to have conferred with him; but he being in bed, I to
Whitehall to the Secretary’s and there wrote to Mr. Coventry; and
so home by coach again. A fine clear moonshine night, but very
cold. Home to my office a while, it being past 12 at night; and so to
supper and to bed.
