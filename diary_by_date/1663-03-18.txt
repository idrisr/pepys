Wake betimes and talked a while with my wife about a wench
that she had hired yesterday, which I would have enquired after
before she comes, she having lived in great families, and so up to
my office — where all the morning; and at noon home to dinner and
after dinner by water to Redriffe, my wife and Ashwell with me,
and so walked; I left them at Halfway house and I to Deptford,
where up and down the storehouses and on board two or three ships
now getting ready to go to sea; and so back and finde my wife
walking in the way, so home again, merry with our Ashwell, who
is a merry jade; and so a while to my office and then home to supper
and to bed. This day, my Tryangle (which was put in tune
yesterday) did please me very well, Ashwell playing upon it pretty
well.
