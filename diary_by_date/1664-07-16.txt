To Whitehall to the Tanger Comittee; and there above my
expectation got the business of our contract for the Victualling
carried for my people — viz., Alsop, Lanyon and Yeabsly. And by
their promise I do thereby get 300/ per annum to myself — which
doth overjoy me; and the matter is left to me to draw up. Mr. Lewes
was in the gallery, and is mightily amused at it; and I believe Mr.
Gauden will make some stir about it, for he wrote to Mr. Coventry
today about it, to argue why he should for the King’s convenience
have it; but Mr. Coventry most justly did argue freely for them that
served the,cheapest.
