Up, and called upon by W. How, who went with W. Hewers
with me by water to the Temple. His business was to have my
advice about a place he is going to buy — the Clerk of the Patent’s
place — which I understand not, and so could say little to him — but
fell to other talk; and setting him in at the Temple, we to Whitehall,
and there I to visit Lord Sandwich, who is now so reserved, or
moped rather, I think with his own business, that he bids welcome
to no man, I think, to his satisfaction. However, I bear with it,
being willing to give him as little trouble as I can and to receive as
little from him, wishing only that Ihad my money in my purse that
I have lent him — but however, I show no discontent at all. So to
Whitehall, where a Committee of Tanger expected, but none met. I
met with Mr. Povy, who] discoursed with about public business.
Thence with W. Hewers (who goes up and down with me like a
jaylour, but yet with great love and to my great good liking, it
being my desire above all things to please my wife therein). I took
up my wife and boy at Unthanks, and from thence to Hercules
Pillars and there dined; and thence to our Upholsters about some
things more to buy, and so to see our coach, and so to the looking-
glass man’s by the New Exchange, and so to buy a picture for our
blue-chamber chimney, and so home; and there I made my boy to
read to me most of the night, to get through the Life of the
Archbishop ofCanterbury. At supper comes Mary Battelier, and with
us all the evening prettily talking, and very innocent company she
is; and she gone, we with much content to bed and to sleep, with
mighty rest all night.
