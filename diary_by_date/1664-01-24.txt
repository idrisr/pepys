Lords day. Lay long in bed. And then up; and being desirous to
perform my vows that Ilately made, among others to be performed
this month, I did go to my office and there fell on entering out of a
by-book part of my second Journall book, which hath lay these two
years and more unentered. Upon this work till dinner; and after
dinner, to it again till night and then home to supper; and after
supper, to read a lecture to my wife upon the globes, and so to
prayers and to bed. This evening also, I drow up a rough draught of
my last Will -— to my mind.
