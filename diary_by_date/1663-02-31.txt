In the evening examining my wife’s letter entended to my
Lady and another to Madamoiselle; they were so false-spelt that I
was ashamed of them and took occasion to fall out about them with
my wife, and so she writ none; at which, however, I was sorry,
because it was in answer to a letter of Madamoiselle — about
business. Late home to supper and to bed.
