Lords day. Up, and Sir J. Minnes set me down at my Lord
Sandwiches, where I waited till his coming down. When he came
too, could find little to say to me; but only a general question or two
and so goodbye. Here his little daughter, my Lady Katharin, was
brought, who is lately come from my father’s at Brampton to have
her cheeke looked after, which is and hath long been sore. But my
Lord will rather have it be as it is, with a scarr in her face, then
398
endanger its being worse by tampering. He being gone, I went
home, a little troubled to see he minds me no more; and with Creed
with me, called at several churches — which, God knows, are
supplied with very young men,' and the churches very empty.
