Office. Which done, Sir W. Penn took me into the garden and
there told me how Mr. Turner doth entend to petition the Duke for
an Allowance Extra as one of the Clerks of the Navy, which he
desired me to join with him in the furthering of. Which I promised
to do, so that it did not reflect upon me or to my damage to have any
other added, as if I was not able to perform my place; which he did
wholly disown to be anyof his intention, but far from it. Itook Mr.
Hater home with me to dinner, with whom I did advise, who did
give me the same counsel.
