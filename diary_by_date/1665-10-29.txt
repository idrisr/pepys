Lords day. Up, and being ready, set out with Capt. Cocke in
his coach toward Erith, Mr. Deane riding along with us— where we
dined and were very merry. After dinner we fell to discourse about
the Dutch, Cocke undertaking to prove that they were able to wage
war with us three year together — which, though it may be true, yet,
not being satisfied with his arguments, my Lord and I did oppose
the strength of his arguments, which brought us to a great heat — he
being a conceited man but of no Logique in his head at all, which
made my Lord and I mirth. Anon we parted and back again, we
hardly having a word all the way, he being so vexed at our not
yielding to his persuasion. I was set down at Woolwich town’s-end
and walked through the town in the dark, it being now night. But
in the street did overtake and almost run upon two women, crying
and carrying a man’s Coffin between them: I suppose the husband
of one of them, which methinks is a sad thing.
