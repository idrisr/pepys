Lords day. To my Lord Keepers at Essex house, where I never
was before since I saw my old Lord Essex lie in state when he was
dead — a large but ugly house. Here all the Officers of the Navy
g81
attended, and by and by were called in to the King and Cabinet,
where my Lord, who was ill, did lie upon the bed, as my old Lord
Treasurer or Chancellor heretofore used to. And the business was
to know in what time all the King’s ships might be repaired fit for
service; the Surveyor answered, “In two years and not sooner.” I
did give them hopes that with supplies of money suitable, we might
have them all fit for sea some part of the summer after this. Then
they demanded in what time we could set out 40 ships: it was
answered, as they might be chosen of the newest and most ready,
we could, with money, get 40 ready against May. The King seemed
mighty full that we should have money to do all that we desired,
and satisfied that without it nothing could be done; and so, without
determining anything, we were dismissed; and I doubt all will end
in some little fleet this year, and those of hired merchantmen; which
would endeed be cheaper to the King, and have many conveniences
attending it, more then to fit out the King’s own. And this I
perceive is designed, springing from Sir W. Coventry’s counsel;
and the King and most of the Lords, I perceive, full of it, to get the
King’s fleet all at once in condition for service.
