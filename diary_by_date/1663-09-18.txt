Up, and got our people together as soon as we could; and after
eating a dish of cold Creame, which was my supper last night too,
we took leave of our beggarly company, though they seem good
people too, and over most sad Fenns (all the way observing the sad
life that the people of that place (which if they be born there, they
call the ““Breedlings”’ of the place) do live, sometimes rowing from
one spot to another, and then wadeing) to Wisbeech, a pretty town
and a fine church and library, where sundry very old Abbee
manuscripts — and a fine house, built on the church ground by
Secretary Thurlow, and a fine gallery built for him in the church,
but now all in the Bishop of Elys hands. After visiting the church
&c., we out of town by the help of a stranger, to find out one
Blinkehorne a miller, of whom we might inquire something of old
Days disposal of his estate and in whose hands it now is; and by
great chance we met him and brought him to our Inne to dinner;
and instead of being informed in his estate by this fellow, we find
that he is the next heire to the estate, which was matter of great
sport to my Cosen Tho. and me, to see such a fellow prevent us in
our hopes.
