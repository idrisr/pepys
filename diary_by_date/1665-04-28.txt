Down the River to visit the victualling ships, where I find all
out of order. And come home to dinner, and then to write a letter to
the Duke of Albemarle about the victualling ships; and carried it
myself to the council chamber, where it was read; and when they
rise, my Lord Chancellor, passing by, stroked me on the head, and
told me that the Board had read my letter and taken order for the
punishing of the watermen for not appearing on board the ships.
And so did the King afterward, who doth now know me so well,
that he never sees me but he speaks to me about our Navy business.
