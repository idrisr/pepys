Up pretty earely; that is, by 7 a-clock, it being not yet light
before or then. So to my office all the morning, signing the
Treasurers ledger, part of it where I have not put my hand. And
then eat a mouthful of pie at home to stay my stomach; and so with
Mr. Waith by water to Deptford and there, among other things,
viewed old pay-books and find that the Comanders did never
heretofore receive any pay for the Rigging-time but only for Sea
time, contrary to what Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten told the
Duke the other day. I also searched all the ships in the Wett docke
for fire and found all in good order — it being very dangerous for the
250
King that so many ships lie together there. I was among the Canvas
in stores also with Mr. Harris the Saylmaker, and learnt the
difference between one sort and another to my great content. And
so by water home again — where my wife tells me stories how she
hears that by Sarahs going to live at Sir W. Penn’s, all our affairs of
my family are made known and discoursed of there, and theirs by
my people — which doth trouble me much, andI shall take a time to
let Sir W. Penn know how he hath dealt in taking her without our
full consent. So to my office, and by and by home to supper. And so
to prayers and bed.
