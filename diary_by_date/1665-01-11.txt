Up, and very angry with my boy for lying long a-bed and
460
forgetting his Lute. To my office all the morning. At noon to the
Change, and so home to dinner. After dinner to Gresham College
to my Lord Brunker and Comissioner Pett, taking Mr. Castle with
me, there to discourse over his draught ofa
ship he is to build for us
— whereI first find reason to apprehend Comissioner Pett to be a
man of any ability extraordinary in anything, for Ifound he did turn
and wind Castle like a chicken in his business, and that most
pertinently and master-like. And great pleasure it was to me to hear
them discourse, Iof late having studied something thereon, and my
Lord Brunker is a very able person also himself in this sort of
business, as owning himself to be a master in the business of all lines
and Conicall Sections. Thence home, where very late at my office,
doing business to my content; though [God] knows with what a do
it was that when I was out I could get myself to come home to my
business, or when I was there, though late, could stay there from
going abroad again. To supper and to bed. This night when I came
home, I was much troubled to hear my poor Canary-bird that I
have kept these three or four years is dead.
