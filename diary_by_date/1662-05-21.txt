My wife andIby water to Westminster; and after she had seen
her father (of whom lately I have heard nothing at all what he does,
or her mother), she came to me to my Lord’s Lodgeings, where she
and I stayed, walking into Whitehall’ garden; and in the privy
Garden saw the finest smocks and linen petticoats of my Lady
Castlemaynes, laced with rich lace at the bottomes, that ever I saw;
and did me good to look upon them. So to Wilkinsons, she and I
and Sarah, to dinner, where I had a good Quarter of Lamb and a
salat. Here Sarah told me how the King dined at my Lady
Castlemayne, and supped, every day and night the last week. And
that the night that the bonefires were made for joy of the Queenes
arrivall, the King was there; but there was no fire at her door,
196
though at all the rest of the doors almost in the street; which was
much observed. And that the King and she did send for a pair of
scales and weighed one another; and she, being with child, was said
to be heavyest. But she is now a most disconsolate creature, and
comes not out of doors — since the King’s going.
