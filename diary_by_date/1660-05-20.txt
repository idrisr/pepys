Upearly; and with Mr. Pickering and the child by waggon to
Scheveling, where it not being yet fit to go off, Iwent to lie down in
a chamber in the house, where in another bed there was a pretty
Duch woman in bed alone; but though Ihada month’s-mind to her,
I had not the boldness to go to her. So there I sleep an hour or two.
At last she rise; and then I rise and walked up and down the chamber
and saw her dress herself after the Duch dress, and talked to her as
much as I could; and took occasion, from her ring which she wore
on her first finger, to kiss her hand; but had not the face to offer
anything more. So at last I left her there and went to my company.
Commissioner Pett at last comes to our lodging, and caused the
boats to go off; so some in one boat, some in another, we all bid
Adieu to the shore. But through badness of weather we were in
great danger, and a great while before we could get the ship; so that
of all the company not one but myself that was not sick —I keeping
myself in the open ayre, though I was soundly wet for it. I having
47
spoke a word or two with my Lord, being not very well settled,
partly through last night’s drinking and want of sleep, Ilay down in
my gown upon my bed and sleep till the 4 a-clock gun the next
morning waked me, which I took for 8 at night that night; and
rising to piss, mistook the sun-rising for the sun-setting on Sunday
night. So into my naked bed and sleep till 9 a-clock.
