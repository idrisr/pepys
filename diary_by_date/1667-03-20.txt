With Sir W. Batten and
J.Mennes to our church to the vestry
to be assessed by the late Pole bill, where I am rated at an Esquire;
and for my office, all will come to about so/ — but not more then |
expected, nor so much by a great deal as I ought to be for all my
offices — so shall be glad to escape so. Thence by water again to
Whitehall, and there up into the House and do hear that news is
come now that the enemy doth incline again to a peace; but could
hear no perticulars, so do not believe it. Thence to Westminster
hall, and there saw Betty Michell and bought a pairof gloves of
her,
she being fain to keep shop there, her mother being sick and father
gathering of the tax. I aime her de todo mi corazon. Thence, my
mind wandering all this day upon mauvais amours which yo be
merry for. So home by water again, where I find my wife gone
abroad; so I to Sir W. Batten to dinner, and had a good dinner of
Ling and herring pie, very good meat — best of that kind that ever I
had — thus having dined, Iby coach to the Temple and there did buy
a little book or two; and it is strange how Rycaut’s discourse of
Turky, which before the fire I was asked but 8s. for, there being all
but 22 or thereabouts burnt, I did now offer 20s., and he demands
sos.; and Ithink I shall give it him, though it be only as a monument
of the Fire. So home to the office a little, where I met with a sad
letter from my brother, who tells me my mother is declared by the
Doctors to be past recovery and that my father is also very ill every
hour; so that I fear we shall see a sudden change there—God fit them
and us for it. So to Sir W. Penn’s, where my wife was, and supped
with a little, but yet little, mirth and a bad nasty supper; which
makes me not love that family, they do all things so meanly, to
make a little bad show upon their backs. Thence home and to bed,
very much troubled about my father’s and my mother’s illness.
