his advice against our pretences to the Prize] office (in his letter
from Portsmouth); because he knew that the King and the Duke
had resolved to put in some parliament-men that have deserved

and then to the office, where my Lord Brunkard comes and reads
over part of our instructions in the Navy; and I expounded it to
him, so he is become my disciple. He gone, comes Cutler to tell us
that the King of France hath forbid any Canvas to be carried out of
his kingdom. And I, to examine, went with him to the East India
house to see a letter, but came too late. So home again and there late,
till 12 at night, at my office; and then home to supper and to bed.
This day (to see how things are ordered in the world), I had a
command from the Earle of Sandwich (at Portsmouth) not to be

friendship to me known) redound against him, as if I had done it
upon his scoare. So I wrote to my Lord my mistake, and am
contented to promise never to pursue it more — which goes against
my mind with all my heart.
