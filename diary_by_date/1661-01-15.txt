Upand down the yard all the morning, and seeing the seamen
exercize, which they do already very handsomely. Taking our
leaves of the officers of the yard, we walked to the waterside and in
our way walked into the Ropeyard, where I do look into the tarr-
houses and other places, and took great notice of all the several
works belonging to the making of a Cable. So after a cup of burnt
wine at the taverne there, we took barge and went to blackwall and
viewed the dock and the new wett dock which is newly made
ela
there, and a brave new merchantman which is to be launched
shortly, and they say to be called the Royall oake. Hence we walked
to dick shoare, and thence to the towre, and so home — where I
found my wife and pall abroad; so I went to see Sir Wm. Pen, and
there found Mr. Coventry come to see him. I sat a great while with
Sir Wm. after he was gone, and have much talk with him. Iperceive
none of our officers care much for one another, but Ido keep in with
them all as much as I can. Home, where my wife not yet come
home. SoI went up to put my papers in order. And then was much
troubled my wife was not come, it being ten a-clock just now
striking as I write this last line.
