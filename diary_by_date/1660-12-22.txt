All the morning with my paynters — who will make an end of
all this day, I hope. At noon I went tothe Sun tavern on Fish streete
hill to a dinner of Capt. Teddimans, where was my Lord Inchiquin
(who seems to bea very fine person), Sir W. Pen, Capt. Cuttance,
and one Mr. Lawrence (a fine gentleman now going to Algier) and
other good company; where we have a very fine dinner, good
Musique anda great deal of Wine. We stayed here very late; at last,
Sir W. Pen and I home together, he so overgone with wine that he
could hardly go; I was forced to lead him through the street and he
was ina very merry and kind moode. Ihome (found my house clear
104
of the workmen and their work ended), my head troubled with
wine; and I, very merry, went to bed — my head akeing all night.
