Up, and to my office; and thence by water to Whitehall to
attend the Council, but did not; and so home to dinner; and so out
933
with my wife and Deb and W. Hewer towards Coopers; but I light
and walked to Ducke lane, and there to the bookseller’s at the Bible,
whose moher yo have a mind to, but ella no era dentro; but I did
there look upon and buy some books, and made way for coming
again to the man; which pleases me. Thence to Reeves’s and there
saw some, and bespoke alittle, perspective — and was mightily
pleased with seeing objects in a dark room. And so to Coopers and
spent the afternoon with them; and it will be an excellent picture.
Thence my people all by water to Deptford to see Balty, while I to
buy my Espinette which I did now agree for; and did at Hawards
meet with Mr. Thacker and hear him play on the Harpsicon, so as I
never heard man before Ithink. So home, it being almost night, and
there find in the garden Pelling, who hath brought Tempest,
Wallington, and Pelham to sing; and there had most excellent
music, late in the dark, with great pleasure. Made them drink and
eat; and so with much pleasure to bed, but above all with little
Wallington. This morning I was let blood, and did bleed about 14
ounces, towards curing my eyes.
