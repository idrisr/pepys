Up, after talking with my wife with pleasure about her
learning on the Flag[el]ette a month or two again this winter, and all
the rest of the year her painting, which I do love. And so to the
office, where sat all the morning. At noon home to dinner with my
gang of clerks, in whose society I am mightily pleased, and
mightily with Mr. Gibsons talking; he telling me so many good
stories relating to the Warr and practices of commanders, which I
will find a time to recollect; and he will be an admirable help to my
writing a history of the Navy, if ever I do. So to the office, where
busy all the afternoon and evening, and then home. My work this
night with my clerks till midnight at the office was to examine my
list of ships I am making for myself, and their dimensions, and to
see how it agrees or differs from other lists; and I do find so great a
difference between them all, that I am at a loss which to take; and
therefore think mine to be as much depended upon as any I can
865
make out of them all. So little care there hath been to this day to
know or keep any history of the Navy.
