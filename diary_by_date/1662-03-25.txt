Lady day. All the morning at the office. Dined with my wife at
home. Then to the office, where (while Sir Wms both did examine
the Victuallers account) I sat in my closet drawing letters and other
businesses — being much troubled for want of an order of the
Councells lately sent us, about making of boates for some ships
now goingtoJamaica. At last, late at night, Ihad a Copy sent me of
it by Sir G. Lane from the Council Chamber. With my mind well at
ease, home and to supper and bed.
