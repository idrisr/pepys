Could sleep but little last night for my concernment in this
business of the victualling for Sir D. Gawden. So up in the morning
and he comes to me, and there I did tell him all and give him my
advice; and so he away, andI to the office, where we met and did a
little business; and I left them, and by water to attend the Council,
whichI did all the morning, but was not called in; but the Council
meets again in the afternocn on purpose about it. So I at noon to
Westminster hall and there stayed a little, and at the Swan also,
thinking to have got Doll Lane thither, but ella did not understand
my signs; and so Iaway and walked to Charing cross, and there into
the great new ordinary by my Lord Mulgrave’s, being led thither
by Mr. Beale, one of Oliver’s and now of the King’s Guards; and he
sat with me while I had two grilled pigeons, very handsome, and
good meat; and there he and I talked of our old acquaintances, W.
Clerke and others, being a very civil man; and so walked to
Westminster and there parted, and I to the Swan again but did
nothing; and so to Whitehall and there attended the King and
Council, who met and heard our answer; I present and then
withdrew, and they spent two hours at least afterwards about it,
946
and at last rose; and to my great content, the Duke of York at
coming out told me that it was carried for D. Gawden.
