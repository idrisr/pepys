Lords day. Up, and with my wife to church; which pleases me
mightily, Ibeing full of fear that she would never go to church again
after she had declared to me that she was a Roman Catholique. But
though I do verily think she fears God, and is truly and sincerely
virtuous, yet I do see she is not so strictly so a Catholique as not to
go to church with me; which pleases me mightily. Here Mills made
a lazy sermon upon Moses’s meekenesse; and so home, and my wife
and I alone to dinner; and then she to reada
little book concerning
Speech in general, a translation late out of French, a most excellent
piece as ever I read, proving a soul in man and all the ways and
secrets by which Nature teaches speech in man — which doth please
me most infinitely to read. By and by my wife to church, and I to
my office to complete my journall for the last three days; and so
home to my chamber to settle some papers, and so to spend the
evening with my wife and W. Hewer, talking over the business of
the office, and perticularly my own office, how Iwill make it; and it
will become ina little time an office of ease, and not slavery, as it
hath for so many years been. So to supper and to bed.
