After office I to my brother’s again, and thence to Madam
Turners, in both places preparing things against tomorrow. And
this night I have altered my resolution of burying him in the
churchyard among my young brothers and sisters; and bury him in
the church in the middle Isle, as near as I can to my mother’s pew —
this costs me 20s. more. This being all, home by coach, bringing
my brother’s silver tankard for safety along with me; and so to
supper after writing to my father, and so to bed.
