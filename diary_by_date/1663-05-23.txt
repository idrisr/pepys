Waked this morning between 4 and 5 by my black-Bird,
which whistles as well as ever Iheard any; only it is the beginning of
many tunes very well, but there leaves them and goes no further. So
up and to my office, where we sat. Home to dinner; and after dinner
by water to the temple and there took my Lyra viall book, bound up
with blank paper for new lessons. Thence to Greatorex’s; and there,
seeing Sir
J.Mennes and Sir W. Penn go by by coach, I went in to
them and to Whitehall, where, in the matted gallery, Mr. Coventry
was; who told us how the parliament hath required of Sir G.
Carteret and him an account what money shall be necessary to be
settled upon the Navy for the ordinary charge, which they intend to
277
report 200000] per annum; and how to allot this, we met this
afternoon and took their papers for our perusal, and so we parted.
Thence back by water to Greatorex’s, and there he showed me his
Varnish which he hath invented, which appears every whit as good,
upona
stick which he hath done, as the indian, though it did not do
very well upon my paper rules with Musique lines, for it sunk and
did not shine.
