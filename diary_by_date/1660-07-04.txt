Up very early in the morning; and landing my wife at White
Friars stairs, | went to the bridge and so to the Treasurer’s of the
Navy, with whomIspoke about the business of my office; who put
me into very good hopes of my business. At his house comes
Commissioner Pett; and I and he went to view the houses in
Seething lane belonging to the Navy, where I find the worst very
good; and had great fears in my mind that they will shuffle me out
of them, which troubles me. So to Westminster hall; where
meeting with Monsieur L’impertinent and W. Bowyer, I took
them to the Sun tavern and gave them a lobster and some wine, and
sat talking like a fool with them till 4 a-clock. So to my Lord’s and
walking all the afternoon in Whitehall Court, in expectation of
what shall be done in the Council as to our business. It was strange
to see how all the people flocked together bare to see the King
looking out of the Council window. At night my Lord told me how
my orders that I drow last night, about giving us power to act, are
granted by the Council — at which he and I were very glad. Home
and to bed, my boy lying in my house this night the first time.
