At home all the morning. And at noon with my wife to the
Wardrobe to dinner; and there did show herself to my Lady in the
hankercher that she bought the lace for the other day; and endeed, it

is very handsome. Here I left my wife, and went to my Lord Privy
Seale to Whitehall and there did give him a copy of the fees of the
office as I have received them, and he was well pleased with it. So to
the Opera, where I met my wife and Capt. Ferrers and Madamoi-
selle la Blanc, and there did see the second part of The Siege ofRhodes
very well done. And so by coach set her home; and the coach
driving down the hill through Thames street (which I think never
any coach did before from that place to the bridge-foot); but going
up Fish street hill, his horses were so tired that they could not be got
to go up the hill, though all the street boys and men did beat and
whip them. At last I was fain to send my boy fora link, and so light
out of the coach till we got another at the corner of Fanchurch street;
and so home. And to bed.
