Lambert to Westminster Abbey, where we saw Dr. Fruen
translated to the Archbishopric of Yorke. Here I saw the Bishops of
Winchester, Bangor, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and Salisbury, all
in their habitts, in King Henry the 7ths chappell. But Lord, at their
going out, how people did most of them look upon them as strange
Creatures, and few with any kind of love or Respect. From thence
we two to my Lord’s, where we took Mr. Sheply and W. Howe to
the Rayne Deare and had some oysters, which were very good, the
first I have eat this year. So back to my Lord’s to dinner; and after
dinner Lieut. Lambert and I did look upon my Lord’s Modell,! and
he told me many thingsin a ship that I desired to understand.
