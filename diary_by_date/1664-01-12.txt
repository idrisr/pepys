Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and at
noon to the Change awhile and so home — getting things against
dinner ready. And anon comes my uncle Wight and my aunt with
their Cozen Mary and Robert, and by chance my Uncle Tho.
Pepys. We had a good dinner, the chief dish a swan roasted, and that
excellent meat. At dinner and all day very merry. After dinner to
Cards, where till evening; then to the office a little and to cards
again with them — and lost half-a-Crowne. They being gone, my
wife did tell me how my Uncle did this day accost her alone and
spoke of his hopings she was with child; and kissing her earnestly,
told her he should be very glad of it; and from all circumstances,
methinks he doth seem to have some intention of good to us, which
I shall endeavour to continue more then ever I did yet. So to my
office till late and then home to bed — after being at prayers, which is
the first time after my late vow to say prayers in my family twice in
every week.
