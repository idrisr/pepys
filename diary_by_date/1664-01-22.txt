Up; and it being a brave morning, by water with a galley to
Woolwich and there, both at the ropeyard and the other yard, did
much business; and thence to Greenwich to see Mr. Pett and others
value the Carved work of the Henrietta (God knows in an ill manner
for the King); and so to Deptford and there viewed Sir W. Petty’s
vessel, which hath an odd appearance but not such as people do
make of it, for I am of the opinion that he would never have
discoursed so much of it ifit were not better then other vessels, and
so I believe that he was abused the other day, as he is now, by
tongues that I am sure speak before they know anything good or
bad of her. I am sorry to find his ingenuity discouraged so. So
home, reading all the way a good book; and so home to dinner, and
after dinner a lesson on the globes to my wife; and so to my office,
where till 10 or 11 a-clock at night; and so home to supper and to
bed.
