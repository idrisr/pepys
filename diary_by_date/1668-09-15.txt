Up mighty betimes, my wife and people, Mercer lying here
all night, by 3 a-clock and I about 5; and they before and Iafter them
to the Coach in Bishopsgate street; which was not ready to set out,
so took wife and Mercer, Deb and W. Hewer (who all set out this
day for Cambridge to Cosen Rogr. Pepys’s to see Sturbridge fayre)
and I showed them the Exchange, which is very finely and carried
on with good despatch.
