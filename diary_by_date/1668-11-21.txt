Up, with great joy to my wife and me, and to the office,
where W. Hewer did most honestly bring me back that part of my
letter under my hand to Deb whereinI called her “‘whore’’, assuring
me that he did not show it her — and that he did only give her to
understand that wherein I did declare my desire never to see her,
and did give her the best Christian counsel he could; which was
mighty well done of him. But by the grace of God, though I love
the poor girl and wish her well, as having gone too far toward the
undoing her, yet Iwill never enquire after or think of her more—my
peace being certainly to do night to my wife.
