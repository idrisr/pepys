This morning (as endeed all the mornings nowadays) much
business at my Lord’s. There came to my house before I went out,
Mr. Barlow, an old consumptive* man and fair-conditioned — with
whomIdid discourse a great while; and after much talk, I did grant
him what he asked — viz., sol per annum if my salary be not
encreased and 1ool per annum in case it be to 350/; at which he was
very well pleased to be paid as I received my money, and not
otherwise. That done and the day proving fair, Iwent home and got
all my goods packed up and sent away. And my wife and Iand Mrs.
Hunt went by coach, overtaking the carts a-drinking in the Strand
—
being come to my house and set-in the goods; and at night sent my
wife and Mrs. Hunt to buy something for supper; they bought a
Quarter of lamb; and so we eat it but it was not half roasted. To bed,
the first night that I ever lay here with my wife.
