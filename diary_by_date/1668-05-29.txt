To Sir G. Carteret’s to dinner, with much good company, it
being the King’s birthday and many healths drunk; and here I did
receive another letter from my Lord Sandwich; which troubles me,
to see how I have neglected him, in not writing, or but once, all this
time of his being abroad. And I see he takes notice, but yet gently,
of it, that it puts me to great trouble and I know not how to get out
918
of it, having no good excuse, and too late now to mend, he being
coming home. Thence home, whither by agreement by and by
comes Mercer and Gayett, and two gentlemen with them, Mr.
Montouth and Pelham, the former a swaggering young handsome
gentleman — the latter a sober citizen merchant; both sing, but the
latter with great skill; the other, no skill but a good voice anda good
basse — but used to sing only tavern tunes; and so I spent all this
evening till 11 at night singing with them, till I tired of them
because of the swaggering fellow with the basse, though the girl
Mercer did mightily commend him before to me. This night yo had
agreed para andar at Deptford, there para haber lain con the moher
de Bagwell, but this company did hinder me.
