In the afternoon we met at the office and sat till night. And
then I to see my father, who I found well, and took him to
Standings to drink a cup of ale. He told me my aunt at Brampton is
yet alive, and my mother well there. In comes Will. Joyce to us,
drunk and in a talking vapouring humour, of his state and I know
not what — which did vex me cruelly. After him Mr. Hollier' [who]
had learned at my father’s that I was here (where I had appointed to
meet him); and so he did give me something to take for prevention.
Will. Joyce not letting us talk as I would, I left my father and him
and took Mr. Hollier to the Greyhound — where he did advise me
above all things both as to the Stone and the decay of my memory
(of which Inow complain to him), to avoyd drinking often; which I
am resolved, ifI can, to leave off. Hence home; and took home with
me from the bookesellers Ogilbys 4sop, which he hath bound for
me; and endeed, I am very much pleased with the book. Home and
to bed.
