Up by 5 a-clock; and while my man Will was getting himself
ready to come up to me, I took and played on my lute a little. So to
dress myself and to my office to prepare things against we meet this
morning. We sat long today and had a great private business before
us about contracting with Sir W. Rider, Mr. Cutler, and Capt.
Cocke for 500 ton of hempe, which we went through and I am to
draw up the conditions. Home to dinner, where I find Mr. Moore.
And he and I did cast up our accounts together and even them. And
1. The houses were being raised by a storey, and the timber frames for the new roof
were being made in the dockyard.

then with the last chest of Crusados to Ald. Backwells; by the same
token, his lady, going to take coach, stood in the shop and having a
gilded glassful of perfumed comfits given her by Don Duarte de
Silva, the Portugall merchant that is come over with the Queene, I
did offer at a taste, and so she poured some out into my hand; and
though good, yet pleased me the better coming froma
pretty lady.
So home and at the office, preparing papers and things; and endeed,
my head hath not been so full of business a great while and with so
much pleasure, for I begin to see the pleasure of it. God give me
health. So to bed.
