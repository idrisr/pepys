Meeting Creed, he and I to the new Cockepitt by the King’s
gate, and there saw the manner of it and the mixed rabble of people
that came thither; and saw two battles of cocks, wherein is no great
sport, but only to consider how these creatures without any
provocation do fight and kill one another — and aim only at one
another’s heads, and by their good wills not leave till one of them be
killed. And thence to the park in a hackney coach, so would not go
into the Tour, but round about the park and to the [Lodge], and
there at the door eat and drank; whither came my Lady Kerneagy,
of whom Creed tells me more perticularly: how her Lord, finding
her and the Duke of York at the King’s first coming in too kind, did
get it out of her that he did dishonour him; and so he bid her
continue to let him, and himself went to the foulest whore he could
find, that he might get the pox; and did, and did give his wife it on
Qo
purpose, that she (and he persuaded and threatened her that she
should) might give it the Duke of York; which she did, and he did
give it the Duchesse; and since, all her children are thus sickly and
infirm — which is the most pernicious and foul piece of revenge that
ever I heard of. And he at this day owns it with great glory, and
looks upon the Duke of York and the world with great content in
the ampleness of his revenge. Thence (where the place was now by
the last night’s rain very pleasant, and no dust) to Whitehall and set
Creed down, and Ihome and to my chamber; there about my music
notions again, wherein J take delight and find great satisfaction in
them; and so after a little supper, to bed. This day in the afternoon,
stepping with the Duke of York into St. James’s park, it rained and I
was forced to lend the Duke of York my cloak, which he wore
through the park.
