In the street met with Mr. Sanchy, my old acquaintance at
Cambrige, reckoned a great minister here in the City, and by Sir
Rd. Ford perticularly, which I wonder at, for methinks in his talk he
is but a mean man. I set him down in Holburne, and I to the Old
Exchange and there to Sir Rob. Viners and made up my accounts
there to my great content; but I find they do not keep them so
regularly as to be able to do it easily and truly and readily. So to the
Change, and there met with Mr. James Hubland; and no hopes, as
he sees, of peace, whatever we pretend; but we shall be abused by
the King of France. This morning came to me the Collectors for my
Pole mony; for which I paid for my title as Esquire and place of
Clerk of Acts, and my head and wife’s, and servants’ and their
wages, 401 17s. ood. And thoughthis bea great deal, yet itis ashame
I should pay no more; that is, that I should not be assessed for my
pay, as in the Victualling business and Tanger, and for my money,
which of my own accord I had determined to charge myself with
10001 money, till coming to the Vestry and seeing nobody of our
ablest merchants, as Sir Andrew Rickard, to do it, I thought it not
decent for me to do it; nor would it be thought wisdom to do it
unnecessarily, but vainglory.
