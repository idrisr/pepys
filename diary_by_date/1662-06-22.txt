Lords day. This day Ifirst put on my slasht doublet, which Ilike
very well. Coming home tonight, I met with Will Swan, who doth
talk as high for the fanatiques as ever he did in his life; and doth pity
my Lord Sandwich and me that we should be given up to the
wickedness of the world, and thata fall is coming upon us all. For he
finds that he and his company are the true spirit of the nation, and the
greater part of the nation, too— who will have liberty of conscience in
spite of this act of uniformity, or they will die; and if they may not
preach abroad, they will preach in their own houses. He told me that
certainly Sir H. Vane must be gone to Heaven, for he died as mucha
martyr and saint as ever any man died. And that the King hath lost
more by that man’s death then he will get again a good while. At all
which, I know not what to think; but I confess I do think that the
Bishops will never be able to carry it so high as they do.
