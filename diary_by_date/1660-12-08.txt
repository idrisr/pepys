I went to dinner with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Pierce the
Chyrurgeon to Mr. Pierce the Purser (the first time that ever I was
at his house), who doth live very plentifully and finely. We have a
lovely Chine of beef and other good things, very complete — and
drank a great deal of wine. And her daughter played after dinner
upon the virginalls, and at night by lanthorne home again; and Mr.
Pierce and his wife being gone home —I went to bed, having drank
so much wine that my head was troubled —-and was not very well all
night. And the Winde, I observed, was ris exceedingly this night
before I went to bed.
