Up, and busy all the morning. Dined at home upona Hare py,
very good meat; and so to my office again, and in the afternoon by
coach to attend the Council at Whitehall, but come too late; so back
with Mr. Gifford, a merchant, and he and I to the Coffee-house,
where I met Mr. Hill and there he tells me that he is to bee Assistant
to the Secretary of the Prize Office (Sir Ellis Layton), which is to be
held at Sir Rd. Fords — which methinks is but something low, but
perhaps may bring him something considerable. But it makes me
alter my opinion of his being so rich as to make a fortune for Mrs.
Pickering. Thence home and visited Sir
J.Mennes, who continues
ill but is something better. There he told me what a mad freaking
fellow Sir Ellis Layton hath been and is — and once at Antwerp, was
really mad. Thence to my office late, my cold troubling me and
having, by squeezing myselfin a coach, hurt my testicles; but Ihope
I will cease its pain without swelling. So home, out of order, to
supper and so to bed.
