office day. At noon comes Mr. Creede to me, whom I took
along with me to the feathers in Fishstreete, where I was invited by
Capt. Cuttance to dinner — a dinner made by Mr. Dawes and his
brother. We have two or three dishes of meat well done. Their great
designe was to get me concerned in a business of theirs about a
vessel of theirs that is in the service, hired by the King, in which I
promise to do them all the service I can.
