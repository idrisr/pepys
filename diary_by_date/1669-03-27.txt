Up, and did alittle business, Middleton and I; then after
drinking a little buttered ale, he and Hutchinson and I took coach,
and exceeding merry in talk, to Dartford, Middleton finding stories
of his own life at Berbados and up and down, at Venice and
elsewhere, that are mighty pretty and worth hearing; and he is a
strange good-companion and droll upon the road, more then ever I
could have thought to have been in him. Here we dined and met
Capt. Allen of Rochester, who dined with us and so went on his
journey homeward. And we by and by took coach again, and got
home about 6 at night, it being all morning as cold, snowy, windy,
and rainy day as any in the whole winter past, but pretty clear in the
afternoon. I find all well, but my wife abroad with Jane, who was
married yesterday; andI to the office busy, till by and by my wife
comes home; so home and there hear how merry they were
yesterday; and I glad at it, they being married it seems very
handsomely, at Islington, and dined at the old house and lay in our
blue chamber, with much company and wonderful merry.
The[oph]. Turner and Mary Battalier bridemaids, and Talb. Pepys
and W. Hewers bridemen. Anon to supper and to bed, my head a
little troubled with the muchness of business I have upon me at
present. So to bed.
