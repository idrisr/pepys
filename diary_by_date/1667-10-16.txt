Up, and at home most of the morning with Sir H. Cholmly
about some accounts of his; and for news, he tells me that the
Commons and Lords have concurred, and delivered the King their
thanks, among other things, for his removal of the Chancellor —
who took their thanks very well; and among other things,
promised them (in these words) “‘never in any degree to entertain
the Chancellor [in] any imployment again.”
