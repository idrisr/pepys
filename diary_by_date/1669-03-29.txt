Up and by water to Whitehall, and there to the Duke of York
1003
to show myself after my journey to Chatham, but did no business
today with him. Only, after gone from him, I to Sir T. Clifford’s
and there, after an hour’s waiting, he being alone in his closet, I did
speak with him and fell to talk of the business of the Navy; and
giving me good words, did fall foule of the constitution, and did
then discover his thoughts that Sir
J.Mennes was too old, and so
was Coll. Middleton, and that my Lord Brouncker did mind his
mathematics too much. I did not give much encouragement to that
of finding fault with my fellow-officers, but did stand up for the
constitution, and did say that what faults there was in our office
would be found not to arise from the constitution, but from the
failures of the officers in whose hands it was. This he did seem to
give good ear to. But did give me of myself very good words;
which pleased me well, though I shall not build upon them
anything.
