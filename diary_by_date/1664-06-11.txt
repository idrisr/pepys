Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning — where
some discourse aris from Sir G. Carteret and Mr. Coventry which
gives me occasion to think that something like a war is expected
now indeed. Mr. Creed dined with me; and thence after dinner by
coach with my wife, only to take the ayre, it being very warm and
pleasant, to Bowe and old Ford and thence to Hackny; there light
and played at shuffleboard, eat cream and good cherries; and so
with good refreshment home. There to my office, vexed with
Capt. Taylor about the delay of carrying down the ship hired by me
for Tanger. And late, about that and other things, at the office. So
home to supper and to bed.
