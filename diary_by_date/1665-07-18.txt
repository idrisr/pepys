Up, and to the office, where all the morning. And so to my
house and eat a bit of victuals; and so to the Change, where a little
business, and a very thin Exchange; and so walked through London
to the Temple, where I took water for Westminster to the Duke of
Albemarle to wait on him; and so to Westminster hall and there paid
for my newsbooks and did give Mrs. Michell (who is going out of
town because of the sickness) and her husbanda pint of wine. And
so Sir W. Warren coming to me by appointment, we away by water
home, by the way discoursing about the project I have of getting
some money, and doing the King good service too, about the mast-
dock at Woolwich, which I fear will never be done if I do not go
about it. After despatching letters at the office, I by water down to
Deptford, where I stayed a little while; and by water to my wife,
whomI have not seen six or five days. And there supped with her
and mighty pleasant, and saw with content her drawings and so to
bed mighty merry. I was much troubled this day to hear at
Westminster how the officers do bury the dead in the open Tuttle
fields, pretending want of room elsewhere; whereas the New
Chapel churchyard was walled in at the public charge in the last
plague-time’ merely for want of room, and now none but such as
are able to pay dear for it can be buried there.
