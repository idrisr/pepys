My wife waked betimes to call up her people to washing, and
so to bed again; whom I then hugged, it being cold now in the
mornings, and then did la otra cosa con her, which I had not done
con ella for these tres meses past, which Ido believe is a great matter
towards the making her of late so indifferent towards me, and with
good reason; but now she had much pleasure, and so to sleep again.
Up by and by, and I with Mr. Gawden by coach to St. James’s,
where we find the Duke gone a-hunting with the King but found
Sir W. Coventry within; with whom we discoursed, and he did
largely discourse with us about our speedy falling upon considering
of retrenchments in the expense of the Navy; which I will put
forward as muchas Ican. So having done there, I to Westminster to
Burges and then walked to the New Exchange; and there to my
bookseller’s there and did buy Scotts discourse of Witches, and do
hear Mr. Cowly mightily lamented his death by Dr. Ward the
Bishop of [Exeter] and Dr. Bates, who were standing there —as the
best poet of our nation, and as good a man. Thence I to the print-
sellers over against the Exchange towards Covent garden, and there
818
bought a few more prints of Cittys and so home with them; and my
wife and maids being gone over the water to the Whitsters with
their clothes, this being the first time of her trying this way of
washing her linen, I dined at Sir W. Batten’s; and after dinner, all
alone to the King’s playhouse, and there did happen to sit just
before Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Knepp, who pulled me by the hair, and
so addressed myself to them and talked to them all the intervalls of
the play, and did give them fruit. The play is Breneralt, which I do
find but little in for my part.
