Tuesday. So paying the reckoning, 14s. 4d., and servants, 2s.,
poor Is., set out; and overtook one coach and kept a while company
with it till one of our horses losing a shoe, we stopped and drank
and spent rs. So on, and passing through a good part of this county
of Wiltshire, saw good house of Alex. Popham’s, and another of
my Lord Craven’s, | think in Barkeshire. We came to Newbery,
and there dined, which cost me, and musick, which a song of the
old Courtier of Q. Eliz, and how he was changed upon the coming
in of the King, did please me mightily, and I did cause W. H[ewer]
to write it out, 3s. 6d. Then comes the reckoning, forced to change
gold, 8s. 7d.; servants and poor, Is. 6d. So out, and lost our way,
which made me vexed, but come into it again; and in the evening
betimes'came to Reding, and there heard my wife read more of
Mustapha. Then to supper, and then I to walk about the town,
which is a very great one, I think bigger than Salsbury: a river runs
through it in seven branches, and unite in one, in one part of the
town, and runs into the Thames ahalf-mile off. One odd sign of
The Broad Face. W. H[ewer] troubled with the headake we had
none of his company last night, nor all this day nor night to talk.
Then to my inn, and so to bed.
