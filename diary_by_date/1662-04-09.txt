Sir G. Carteret, Sir Wms both, and myself all the morning at
the office, passing the Victualler’s accounts; and at noon to dinner at
the Dolphin — where a good Chine of beef and other good cheer. At
dinner Sir George showed me an account in french of the great
Famine, which is to the greatest extremity in some part of France at
this day — which is very strange.
