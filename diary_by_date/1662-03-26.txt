Up earely — this being, by God’s great blessing, the fourth
solemne day of my cutting for the stone this day four year. And am
by God’s mercy in very good health, and like to do well, the Lord’s
name be praised for it. To the office and Sir G. Carterets all the
morning, about business. At noon came my good guest Madame
Turner, The[oph]. and Cosen Norton, and a gentleman, one Mr.
Lewin of the King’s life-guard; by the same token he told us of one
of his fellows, killed this morning in the dewell. I had a pretty
dinner for them — viz: a brace of stewed Carps, six roasted chicken,
and a Jowle of salmon hot, for the first course — a Tanzy and two
neats’ tongues and cheese the second. And were very merry all the
afternoon, talking and singing and piping on the Flagelette. In the
evening they went with great pleasure away; and I with great
content, and my wife, walked half an houre in the garden; and so
home to supper and to bed. We had a man-cook to dress dinner
today, and sentfor Jane to help us. And my wife and she agreed 31a
year (she would not serve under) till both could be better provided;
and so she stays with us.
