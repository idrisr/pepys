office day all the morning. After dinner I went home, where I
found Mr. Cooke, who told me that my Lady Sandwich is come to
town today, whereupon I went to Westminster to see her; and
found her at supper, so she made me sit down all alone with her; and
after supper stayed and talked with her — she showing most
extraordinary love and kindness and did give me good assurance of
my Uncles resolution to make me his heire. From thence home and
to bed.
