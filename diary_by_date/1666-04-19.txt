Lay long in bed; so to the office, where all the morning. At
noon dined with Sir W. Warren at the Pope’s head. So back to the
office, and there met with the Comissioners of the Ordnance,
where Sir W. Pen, being almost drunk, vexed me, and the more
because Mr. Chichly observed it with me —- and it was a
disparagement to the office. They gone, Ito my office. Anon comes
home my wife from Brampton—not looked for till Saturday; which
will hinder me ofa little pleasure, but I am glad of her coming. She
tells me Palls business with Ensum is like to go on; but I must give,
and she consents to it, another 10o0l. She says she doubts my father 1s
in want of money, for rents come in mighty slowly. My mother
grows very impatient and troublesome, and my father mighty
infirm, through his old distemper — which all together makes me
mighty thoughtful. Having heard all this, and bid her welcome, Ito
the office, where late; and so home, and after a little more talk with
my wife, she to bed and I after her.
