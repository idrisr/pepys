Upand to the office, where all the morning. At noon dined at
home, my brother Balty with me, who is fitting himself to go to
sea. So lafter dinner to my accounts, and did proceed a good way in
settling them; and thence to the office, where all the afternoon late
writing my letters and doing business. But Lord, what a conflict I
had with myself, my heart tempting me a thousand times to go
abroad about some pleasure or other, notwithstanding the weather
foul. However, I reproached myself with my weakness in yielding
so much my judgment to my sense, and prevailed with difficulty;
and did not budge, but stayed within and to my great content did a
great deal of business; and so home to supper and to bed. This day I
am told that Mall Davis, the pretty girl that sang and danced so well
at the Duke’s house, is dead.
