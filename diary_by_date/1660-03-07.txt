Ash wednesday. My father newly come home from Brampton
very well; who left my Uncle with his leg very dangerous, and he
doth believe he cannot continue in that condition long. He tells me
that my Uncle did acquaint him very largely what he did intend to
do with his estate; to make me his Heire and to give my Brother
Tom some things, and that my father and mother should have
something likewise for to raise portions for Joh. and Pall: I pray
God he may be as good as his word.
