Called up, as [had appointed, by H. Russell, between 2 and 3 a-
clock: and I and my boy Tom by water with a galley down to the
Hope, it being a fine starry night. Got thither by 8 a-clock and
there, as expected, found the Charles, her mainmast setting. Comis-
sioner Pett aboard. I up and down to see the ship I was so well
acquainted with’ — and a great work it is, the setting so great a mast.
Thence the Comissioner and Ion board Sir G. Ascue in the Henery —
who lacks men mightily. Thence, not staying, the wind blowing
hard, I made use of the Jemmy Yacht and returned to the Tower in
her— my boy beinga very droll boy and good company. Home and
eat something, and then shifted myself and to Whitehall; and there,
the King being in his Cabinet council (Idesiring to speak with Sir G.
Carteret), I was called in and demanded by the King himself many
Questions, to which I did give him full answers. There was at this
council my Lord Chancellor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord
Treasurer, the two Secretarys, and Sir G. Carteret. Not alittle
contented at this chance of being made known to these persons, and
called often by my name by the King —I to Mr. Pierce’s to take leave
of him, but he not within but saw her; and made very little stay but
straight home to my office, where I did business, and then to supper
and to bed.
