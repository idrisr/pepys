Up; and it being dirty, I by coach (which I was forced to go to
the Change for) to Whitehall, and there did deliver the Duke of
York a Memoriall for the Council about the case of Tanger’s want
of money, and I was called in and there my paper was read; Idid not
think fit to say much, but left them to make what use they pleased of
my paper; and so went out and waited without all the morning, and
at noon hear that there is something ordered towards our help; and
so I away by coach home, taking up Mr. Prin at the Court gate (it
raining) and setting him down at the Temple. And by the way did
ask him about the manner of holding of Parliaments, and whether
862
the number of Knights and Burges’s were alway the same; and he
says that the latter were not, but that for aught he can find, they
were sent up at the discretion, at first, of the Sheriffes, to whom the
writs are sent to send up generally the Burges’s and Cittizens of
their county; and he doth find that heretofore, that Parliament-men
being paid by the country,* several Burroughs have complained of
the Sheriffes putting them to the charge of sending up Burges’s;
which is a very extraordinary thing to me that knew not this but
thought that the number had been known, and always the same.
Thence home to the office, and so with my Lord Brouncker and his
mistress, Williams, to Capt. Cocke’s to dinner, where was Temple
and Mr. Porter — and a very good dinner, and merry. Thence with
Lord Brouncker to Whitehall to [the] Commissioners of Treasury,
at their sending for us to discourse about the paying of tickets; and
so away, and I by coach to the Change and there took up my wife
and Mercer and the girl by agreement; and so home, and there with
Mercer to teach her more of It is decreed, and to sing other songs and
talk all the evening; and so after supper, I to even my Journall since
Saturday last, and so to bed.
