Home from my office to my Lord’s lodgings, where my wife
had got ready a very fine dinner: viz. a dish of marrow-bones. A leg
of mutton. A loin of veal. A dish of fowl, three pullets, and two
dozen of larks, all in a dish. A great tart. A neat’s tongue. A dish of
anchoves. A dish of prawns, and cheese. My company was my
father, my uncle Fenner, his two sons, Mr. Pierce, and all their
wifes, and my brother Tom. We were as merry as I could frame
myself to be in that company. W. Joyce, talking after the old rate
and drinking hard, vexed his father and mother and wife. And I did
perceive that Mrs. Pierce her coming so gallant, that it put the two
young women quite out of courage. When it became dark, they all
went away but Mr. Pierce and W. Joyce and their wifes and Tom,
and drank a bottle of wine afterwards, so that Will did heartily
anger his father and mother by staying. At which I and my wife
were very much pleased. Then they all went andI
fell to writing of
two Characters for Mr. Downing, and carried them to him at 9 a-
clock at night; and he did not like them but corrected them, so that
tomorrow I am to do them anew. To my Lord’s lodging again and
sat by the great log, it being now a very good fire, with my wife;
and eat a bit and so home.
