Up by 4a-clock in the morning; and with W. Hewer there till
12 without intermission, putting some papers in order. Thence to
the coffee-house with Creed, where I have not beena great while -
where all the news is of the Dutch being gone out — and of the
plague growing upon us in this town and of remedies against it;
some saying one thing, some another.
