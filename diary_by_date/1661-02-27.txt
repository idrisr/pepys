Atthe office all the morning. Then came into the garden to me
young Mr. Powell and Mr. Hooke, that I once knew at Cambrige,
and I took them in and gave thema bottle of wine and so parted.
ThenI called for a dish of fish, which we had for dinner
— this being
the first day of Lent; and I do entend to try whether I can keep it or
no. This day the Comissioners of Parliament begin to pay off the
Fleet, beginning with the Hampshire— and do it at Guildhall for fear
of going out of the town into the power of the seamen, who are
highly incensed against them.
