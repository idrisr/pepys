Up and within all the morning, being willing to keep as much
as I could within doors. But receiving a very wakening letter from
Mr. Coventry about fitting of ships, which speaks something like
to be done, I went forth to the office, there to take order in things.
And after dinner to Whitehall to a Committee of Tanger, but did
little. So home again and to Sir W. Pen — who, among other things
of haste in this new order for ships, is ordered to be gone presently
to Portsmouth to look after the work there. I stayed to discourse
with him; and so home to supper, where upon a fine couple of
pigeons, a good supper. And here I met a pretty Cabinet sent me by
Mr. Shales, which I gave my wife - the first of that sort of goods I
ever had yet — and very conveniently it comes for her closet. Stayed
up late finding out the private boxes, but could not do some of
them; and so to bed, afeared that I have been too bold today in
venturing in the cold. This day I begin to drink Buttermilke and
whey — and I hope to find great good by it.
