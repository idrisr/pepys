Up and to the office, where all the morning; and at noon my
wife and J alone, having a good hen with eggs to dinner, with great
content. Then by coach to my brother’s, where I spent the
afternoon in paying some of the charges of: the buriall and in
looking over his papers; among whichIfind several letters of my
brother John’s to him, speaking very foul words of me and my
deportment to him here, and very crafty designs about Sturtlow
land and God knows what — which Iam very glad to know and shall
make him repent them. Anon my father and my brother John came
to town by coach. I
sat till night with him, giving him an account of
things. He, poor man, very sad and sickly. I in great pain through a
368
simple squeezing of my cods today, by putting one leg over another
as I have formerly done, which made me hasten home; and after a
little at the office, in great disorder home to bed.
