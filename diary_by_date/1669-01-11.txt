Up and with W. Hewer, my guard, to Whitehall, where no
Committee of Tanger met; so up and down the House talking with
this and that man; and so home, calling at the New Exchange fora
book or two to send to Mr. Sheply; and thence home, and thence to
the Change and there dida little business; and so walked home to
dinner and then abroad with my wife to King’s playhouse and there
saw The Joviall Crew, but ill acted to what it was heretofore in
Clun’s time and when Lacy could dance. Thence to the New
Exchange to buy some things; and among others, my wife did give
me my pair of gloves, which by contract she is to give me in her 301
a year. Here Mrs. Smith tells us of the great murder thereabouts on
Saturday last, of one Capt. Brombrige by one Symons, both of her
acquaintance, and hectors that were at play and in drink; the former
is killed, and is kinsman to my Lord of Ormond; which made him
speak of it with so much passion, as I overheard him this morning,
but could not make anything of it till now. But would they would
kill more of them. So home; and there at home all the evening, and
made Tom to prick down some little conceits and notions of mine
in Musique, which doth mightily encourage me to spend some
more thoughts about it; for I fancy, upon good reason, that Iam in
the right way of unfolding the mystery of this matter better then
ever yet.
