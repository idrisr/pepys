Lords day. Up, and with Sir
J.Mennes by coach to Whitehall;
and there coming late, I to rights to the chapel — where in my usual
place Iheard one of the King’s chaplains, one Mr. Floyd, preach. He
was out two or three times in his prayer, and as many in his sermon;
but yet he made a most excellent good sermon, of our duty to
imitate the lives and practice of Christ and the saints departed. And
did it very handsomely, and excellent style — but was a little over-
large in magnifying the graces of the nobility and prelates that we
have seen in our memories in the world, whom God hath taken
from us. Thence into the Court, and there delivered copies of my
report to my Lord Treasurer, to the Duke of York, Sir W.
Coventry, and others. And attended there till the Council met, and
then was called in and I read my letter. My Lord Treasurer declared
that the King had nothing to give till the Parliament did give him
some money. So the King did of himself bid me to declare to all that
would take our tallies for payment, that he should, as soon as the
Parliament’s money doth come in, take back their tallies and give
them money — which I giving him occasion to repeat to me (it
coming from him against the gré, Iperceive, of my Lord Treasurer),

Iwas content therewith and went home~and glad that Ihave got so
much. Here I saw Mrs. Steward this afternoon, methought the
beautifullest creature that ever I saw in my life, more then ever I
thought her, as often as I have seen her - andI begin to think doth
exceed my Lady Castlemayne, at least now.
