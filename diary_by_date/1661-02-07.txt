With Sir Wm. Batten and Pen to Whitehall to Mr. Coventry’s
chamber to debate upon the business we were upon the other
morning; and thence to Westminster hall and after a walk or two, to
my Lord’s; where, while I and my Lady was in her chamber in talk,
in comes my Lord from Sea, to our great wonder. He had dined at
Havre de Grace on Monday last and came to the Downe[s] the next
day and lay at Canterbury that night; and so to Dartford, and thence
this morning to Whitehall. All my friends, his servants, well.
Among other, Mr. Creed and Capt. Ferrers tell me the story of my
Lord Duke of Buckingam’s and my Lords falling out at Havre de
Grace at Cards — they two, and my Lord St. Albans, playing. My
Lord sent the next morning to the Duke to know whether he did
remember what he said last night and whether he would owne them
with his sword and a second; which he said he would, and so both
sides agreed. But my Lord St. Albans and the Queene and Abbot
117
Mountagu did waylay them at their lodgings till the difference was
made up, much to my Lord’s honour, who hath got great
reputation thereby.
