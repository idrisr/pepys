Lords day. To church in the morning, where Mr. Mills
preached upon Christ’s being offered up for our sins. And there,
proveing the equity with what Justice God could lay our sins upon
his Son, he did make such a sermon (among other things, pleading
from God’s universall Soverainty over all his Creatures, the power
he hath of commanding what he would of his Son, by the same rule
as that he might have made us all and the whole world from the
beginning to have been in hell, arguing from the power the potter
hath over his clay), that I could have wished he had let it alone. And
speaking again, that God the Father is now so satisfyd by our
Security for our debt that we might say.at the last day, as many of us
as have interest in Christ’s death — Lord, we owe thee nothing — our
debt is paid — we are not beholden to thee for anything, for thy debt
is paid thee to the full — which methinks were very bold words.
