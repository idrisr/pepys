Up, and to the office,! where we sat all the morning; and at
noon dined together upon some victuals I had prepared at Sir W.
Batten’s upon the King’s charge. And after dinner, I having
despatched some business and set things in order at home, we down
to the water and by boat to Greenwich to the Bezan Yacht, where
Sir W. Batten, Sir
J.Mennes, my Lord Bruncker and myself, with
some servants (among others, Mr. Carcasse, my Lord’s Clerke, a
very civil Gentleman) imbarked in the Yacht, and down we went
most pleasantly — and noble discourse I had with my Lord
Bruncker, who is a most excellent person. Short of Gravesend, it
grew calme, and so we came to an Anchor — and to supper mighty
merry. And after, it being moonshine, we out of the Cabbin to
laugh and talk; and then, as we grew sleepy, went in, and upon
ve[l]vet cushions of the King’s that belong to the Yacht fell to sleep
— which we all did pretty well till 3 or 4 of the clock — having risen in
the night to look for a new Comet which is said to have lately
shone. But we could see no such thing.
