Up; and carrying Gosnell by coach, set her down at Temple
barr, she going about business of hers today. By the way she was
telling me how Balty did tell her that my wife did go every day in
the week to Court and plays, and that she should have liberty of
going abroad as often as she pleased, and many other lies; which I
am vexed at, and I doubt the wench did come in some expectation
of — which troubles me. So to the Duke and Mr. Coventry, I
alone, the rest being at a pay and elsewhere. Then to my Lord
Sandwiches and there spent the rest of the morning in making up
my Lord’s accounts with Mr. Moore; and then dined with Mr.
Moore and Battersby his friend — very well, and merry and good
discourse. Then into the parke to see them slide with their Scates,
which is very pretty, and so to the Dukes, where the Comittee for
Tanger met; and here we sat down all with him at a table and had
much good discourse about that business — and is to my great
content. That done, and hearing what play it was that is to be
acted before the King tonight, I would not stay; but home by
coach — where I find my wife troubled about Gosnell, who brings
word that her uncle, Justice Jiggins, requires her to come three
times a week to him to fallow some business that her mother
intrusts her withal, and that unless she may have that leisure given
her, he will not have her to take any place — for which we are both
troubled, but there is no help for it; and believing it to be a good
providence of God to prevent my running behind-hand in the
world, I am somewhat contented therewith and shall make my
wife so; who, poor wretch, I know will consider of things, though
in good earnest, the privacy of her life must need be irkesome to
her. So I made Gosnell [sing] and we sat up, looking over the
book of Dances till 12 at night, not observing how the time went;
and so to prayers and to bed.
