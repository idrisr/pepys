To Whitehall and got up to the top gallery in the banquetting-
house to see the Audience of the Russia Embassador; which after
long waiting and fear of the falling of [the] gallery, it being so full
and part of it being parted from the rest for nobody to come upon,
merely from the weakenesse thereof. And very handsome it was.
After they were come in, I went down and got through the croude
almost as high as the King and the Embassadors, where Isaw all the
presents, being rich furs, hawkes, carpets, cloths of tissue, and sea-
horse teeth. The King took two or three hawkes upon his fist,
having a glove on, wrought with gold, given him for that purpose.

The son of one of the Embassadors was in the richest suit, for pearl
and tissue, that ever I did see, or shall, I believe. After they and all
the company had kissed the King’s hand, then the three Embassa-
dors and the son, and no more, did kiss the Queenes. One thing
more I did observe, that the chief Embassador did carry up his
master’s Letters in state before him, on high; and as soon as he had
delivered them, he didfall down to the ground and lay there a great
while. So with Mr. Creede to the Harp and ball; and there meeting
with Mr. How, Goodgroome and young Coleman, did drink and
talk with them; and I have almost found out a young gentlewoman
for my turn to wait on my wife, of a good family and that can sing.
Thence I went away; and getting a coach, went home and sat late
talking with my wife about our entertaining Dr. Clarkes lady and
Mrs. Pierce shortly, being in great pain that my wife hath never a
winter gowne; being almost ashamed of it that she should be seen in
a taffata one when all the world wears Moyrte. So to prayers and to
bed.
