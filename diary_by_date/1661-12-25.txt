Christmas day. In the morning to church; where at the door of
our pew I was fain to stay, because that the Sexton had not opened
the door. A good sermon of Mr. Mills. Dined at home all alone.
And taking occasion, from some fault in the meat, to complain of
my maid’s Sluttery, my wife andI
fell out, and Iup to my Chamber
ina discontent. After dinner my wife comes up to me and all friends
again; and she and I to walk upon the Leads; and there Sir W. Pen
called us and we went to his house and supped with him. But before
supper, Capt. Cock came to us half-drunck and begun to talk; but
Sir W. Pen, knowing his humour and that there was no end of his
talking, drinks four great glasses of wine to him one after another,
168
healths to the King &c., and by that means made him drunk, and so
he went away; and so we sat down to supper and were merry; and
so after supper home and to bed.
