To Hales’s to see my wife’s picture, which Ilike mighty well;
and there had the pleasure to see how suddenly he draws the
Heavens, laying a dark ground and then lightening it when and
where he will. Thence to walk all alone in the fields behind Grays
Inne, making an end of reading over my dear Faber Fortune of my
Lord Bacon’s; and thence, it growing dark, took two or three
wanton turns about the idle places and lanes about Drury lane, but
to no satisfaction, but a great fear of the plague among them; and so
anon I walked by invitation to Mrs. Pierce’s, where I find much
good company; that is to say, Mrs. Pierce, my wife, Mrs. Worship
and her daughter, and Harris the player and Knipp, and my wife
and Mercer, and Mrs. Barbary Shelden, who is come this day to
spend a week with my wife. And here, with music, we danced and
sung and supped, and then to sing and dance till past one in the
morning. And much mirth with Sir Anthony Apsly and one Coll.
Sidny, who lodge in the house — and above all, they are mightily
taken with Mrs. Knipp. Hence, weary and sleepy, we broke up,
and I and my company home well by coach and to bed.
