Then John Goods waken[ed] me and by the Captaines boy
brought me four barrels of Mallows oysters which Capt. Tatnell
had sent me from Murlace. The weather foul all this day also. By
letter that came hither in my absence, I understand that the
Parliament hath ordered all persons to be secured, in order to a trial,
that did sit as judges in the late King’s death; and all the officers, too,
attending the court. At Court I find that all things grow high. The
old Clergy talk as being sure of their lands again, and laugh at the
presbitery; and it is believed that the Sales of the King and Bishops’
lands will never be confirmed by Parliament, there being nothing
now in any man’s power to hinder them and the King from doing
what they have a mind; but everybody willing to submit to
anything. We expect every day to have the King and Duke on board
so soon as it is fair. My Lord doth nothing now; but offers all things
to the pleasure of the Duke as Lord High Admirall—so that lam at a
loss what to do.
