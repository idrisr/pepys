Lords day. My wife being much in pain, I went this morning to
Dr. Williams (who had cured her once of this business) in
Holborne, and he did give me an oyntment which I sent home by
my boy andaplaster, which I took with me to Westminster, where
I dined with Mr. Sheply (my Lord dining at Kensington).
