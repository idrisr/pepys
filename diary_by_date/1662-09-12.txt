At my office all the morning — Mr. Lewes teaching me to
understand the method of making up pursers accounts, which is
very needful for me and very hard. Dined at home, all in dirt and
my mind weary ofbeing thus outoforder; but Ihope in God it will
away, but for the present I am very melancholy, as I have been a
great while. All the afternoon, till 9 at night, at my office; and then
home and eat an egge or two, and so to my lodgings. And to bed.
