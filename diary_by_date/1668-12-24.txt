Acold day. Up and to the office, where all the morning alone
at the office, nobody meeting, being the Eve of Christmas. At noon
home to dinner and then to the office, busy all the afternoon, and at
night home to supper; and it being now very cold, and in hopes of a
frost, I begin this night to put on a Wastecoate, it being the first
winter in my whole memory that ever I stayed till this day before I
did so. So to bed, in mighty good humour with my wife, but sad in
one thing, and that is for my poor eyes.
