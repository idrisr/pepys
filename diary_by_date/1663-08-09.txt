Lords day. Up; and leaving mybrother John to go somewhither
else, I to church and heard Mr. Mills (who is lately returned out of
the country, and it seems was fetched in by many of the
parishioners with great state) preach upon the Authority of the
301
Ministers, upon these words: “Wee are therefore Embassadors of
Christ.”” Wherein, among other high expressions, he said that such
a learned man used to say that if a minister of the word and an
Angell should meet him together, he would salute the Minister first
— which methought wasalittle too high. This day I begun to make
use of the Silver pen (Mr. Coventry did give mee) in writing of this
sermon, taking only the heads of it in Latin; which I shall I think
continue to do. So home and at my office, reading my vowes; and
so to Sir W. Batten to dinner. Thence in the afternon with my Lady
Batten, leading her through the streets by the hand to St. Dunstans
church, hard by us (where by Mrs. Russells means we were set
well); and heard an excellent sermon of one Mr. Gifford, the parson
there — upon “Remember Lot’s wife.”” Home and stayed up a good
while, examining Will in his Latin bible and my brother along with
him in his Greeke. And so to prayers and to bed. This afternoon I
was amuzed at the tune set to the psalm by the clerke of the parish;
and thought at first that he was out, but I find him to be a good
songster, and the parish could sing it very well and was a good tune.
But I wonder that there should bea tune in the psalms that I never
heard of.
