Up betimes, and shaved myself after a week’s growth; but
Lord, how ugly I was yesterday and how fine today. By water,
seeing the City all the way, a sad sight endeed, much fire being still
in — to Sir W. Coventry, and there read over my collection of the
perticulars of the excess of charge created by a war — with good
content. Sir W. Coventry was in great pain lest the French fleet
should be passed by our fleet — who had notice of them on Saturday,
and were preparing to go meet them; but their minds altered, and
judged them merchantmen, when the same day, the Success, Capt.
Ball, made their whole fleet, and came to Brightemson and thence
at § a-clock afternoon, Saturday, wrote Sir W. Coventry news
thereof. So that we do much fear our missing them. Here came in
and talked with him, Sir Tho. Clifford, who appears a very fine
gentleman, and much set by at Court for his activity in going to sea,
and stoutness everywhere and stirring up and down. Thence by
coach over the ruines, down Fleete streete and Cheapside to Broad
street to Sir G. Carteret, where Sir W. Batten (and Sir
J.Mennes,
whom I had not seen a long time before, being his first coming
abroad) and Lord Brouncker passing his accounts. Thence home a
little to look after my people at work, and back to Sir G. Carteret to
dinner; and thence, after some discourse with him upon our public
accounts, I back home, and all the day with Harman and his people
finishing the hangings and beds in my house; and the hangings will
be as good as ever, and perticularly in my new closet. They gone,
and I weary, my wife and I, and Balty and his wife, who came
hither today to help us, to a barrel of oysters I sent from the River
today, and so to bed.
