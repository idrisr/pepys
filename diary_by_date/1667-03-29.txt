[With Balty] to my shoemaker’s, cutler’s, tailor’s, and up and
down about my mourning; and in my going do observe the great
streets in the City are marked out with piles drove into the ground;
and if ever it be built in that form, with so fair streets, it will be a
noble sight. So to the Council chamber, but stayed not there; but to
a periwig-maker’s of his acquaintance and there bought two
periwigs, mighty fine; endeed, too fine I thought for me; but he
persuaded me, and I did buy them, 4l 10s. the two. Then to the
Exchange and bought gloves, and so to the Bull head taverne,
whither he brought my French Gun and one True Locke the famous
gunsmith, that is a mighty ingenious man, and he did take my gun
in pieces and made me understand the secrets thereof; and upon the
whole, doth find it a very good piece of work and truly wrought,
but for certain not a thing to be used much with safety; and he doth
find that this very gun was never yet shot off. I was mightily
satisfied with it and him and the sight of so much curiosity of this
kind. Here he brought also a haberdasher at my desire, and Ibought
ahat of him. And so away and called my wife from his house; and so
home and to read, and then to supper and to bed.
