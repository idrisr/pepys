I lay and slept long today. Office day. I took occasion to be
angry with my wife before I ris about her putting up of half-a-
crowne of mine in a pepper box, which she hath forgot where she
hath lain it. But we were friends again, as we are always. Then] rise
88
to Jack Cole, who came to see me. Then to the office. So home to
dinner — where I find Capt. Murford, who did put 3/ in my hands
fora friendship Ihave done him; but Iwould not take it, but bid him
keep it till he hath enough to buy my wife a necklace. This
afternoon I went to Mr. Greatorex, where I met [Mr. Spong]; and
so to an alehouse, where I bought of him a drawing pen and he did
show me the manner of the Lamp glasses, which carry the light a
great way. Good to read in bed by and Iintend to have one of them.
So to Mr. Lillys' with Mr. Spong; where well received, there being
a Clubb there tonight among his friends* — among the rest,
Esquire Ashmole, who I find a very ingenious Gentleman; with
him we two sang afterward in Mr. Lillys study. That done, we all
parted and Ihome by Coach, taking Mr. Booker with me— who did
tell me a great many fooleries what may be done by Nativitys; and
blaming Mr. Lilly for writing to please his friends and to keep in
with the times (as he did formerly to his owne dishonour) and not
according to the rules of Art, by which he could not well erre, as he
hath done. I set him downe at Limestreete end; and so home, where
I found a box of Carpenters tooles sent by my Cozen Tho. Pepys,
which I have bespoake of him for to imploy myself with
sometimes. To bed.
