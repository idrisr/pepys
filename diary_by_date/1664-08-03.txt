Up betimes and set some Joyners on work to new lay my floor
in our Wardrobe, which I intend to make a room for Musique.
Thence abroad to Westminster; among other things, to Mr.
Blagrave’s and there have his consent for his kinswoman to come to
be with my wife for her woman; at which I am well pleased — and
hope she may do well.
