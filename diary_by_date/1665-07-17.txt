Up, all ofus, and to Billiards — my lady Wright, Mr. Cartert,
myself and everybody. By and by the young couple left together.
Anon to dinner, and after dinner Mr. Carteret took my advice
about giving to the servants, and Iled him to give 10] among them,
which he did by leaving it to the chief manservant, Mr. Medows, to
do for him. Before we went, I took my Lady Jem apart and would
know how she liked this gentleman and whether she was under any
difficulty concerning him. She blushed and hid her face awhile, but
at last I forced her to tell me; she answered that she could readily
obey what her father and mother had done— which was all she could
say or I expect. So anon took leave and for London. But Lord, to
see, among other things, how all these great people here are afeared
of London, being doubtful of anything that comes from thence or
that hath lately been there, that I was forced to say that I lived
wholly at Woolwich. In our way Mr. Carteret did give me mighty
thanks for my care and pains for him, and is mightily pleased —
though the truth is, my Lady Jem hath carried herself with mighty
discretion and gravity, not being forward at all in any degree but
$05
mighty serious in her answers to him.
