Up, it being a cold misling morning, and so by water to the
office, where very busy upon several businesses. At noon got the
messenger, Marlow, to get me a piece of bread and butter and
cheese and a bottle of beer and ale, and so I went not outofthe office
but dined off that, and my boy Tom, but the rest of my clarks went
home to dinner. Then to my business again, and by and by sent my
waterman to see how Sir W. Warren doth, who is sick, and for
which I have reason to be very sorry, he being the friend I have got
most by of most friends in England but the King. Who returns me
$27
that he is pretty well again, his disease being an ague. I by water to
Deptford, thinking to have seen my valentine, but I could not and
so come back again — and to the office, where a
little business; and
thence with Capt. Cocke and there drank a cup of good drink
(which I am fain to allow myself during this plague time, by advice
of all and not contrary to my oath, my physician being dead and
Chyrurgeon out of the way whose advice I am obliged to take); and
so by water home and eat my supper, and so to bed — being in much
pain to think what I shall do this winter time; for, go every day to
Woolwich Icannot, without endangering my life, and staying from
my wife at Greenwich is not handsome.
