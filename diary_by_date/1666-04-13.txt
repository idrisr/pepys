Up, being called up by my wife’s brother, for whom I have
got a commission from the Duke of Yorke for muster-master of
one of the Divisions of which Harman is Rereadmirall, of which I
am glad as well as he. After I had acquainted him with it and
discoursed a
little of it, I went forth and took him with me by coach
to the Duke of Albemarle; who being not up, I took a walk with
Balty into the park, and to the Queen’s chapel, it being Goodfriday;
where people were all upon their knees, very silent — but it seems no
Masse this day. So back, and waited on the Duke and received some
commands of his; and so by coach to Mr. Hales’s— where it is pretty
strange to see that his second doing, I mean the second time of her
sitting, is less like Mrs. Pierce then the first — and yet I am confident
will be most like her, for he is so curious that I do not see how it is
possible for him to mistake. Here, he and I presently resolved of
going to Whitehall, to spend an hour in the galleries there among
the pictures; and we did so to my extraordinary satisfaction, he
showing me the difference in the painting; and when I come more
and more to distinguish and observe the workmanship, I do not
find so many good things as I thought there was — but yet great
difference between the works of some and others — and while my
head and judgment was full of these, I would go back again to his
house to see his pictures. And endeed, though I think at first sight
some difference doth open, yet very inconsiderably; but that I may
judge his to be very good pictures. Here we fell into discourse of my
picture, and Iam for his putting out the Lanskipp, though he says it
is very well done; yet I do judge it will be best without it, and so it
shall be put out — and be made a plain sky, like my wife[s] picture,
which will be very noble.
