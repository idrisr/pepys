Up, and to the office, where all the morning drawing up an
answer to the Report of the Committee for Miscarriages to the
Parliament, touching our paying men by tickets— which I did do in
879
a very good manner I think. Dined with my clerks at home, where
much good discourse of our business of the Navy and the troubles
now upon us, more then we expected. After dinner, my wife out
with Deb to buy some things against my sister’s wedding’ and I to
the office to write fair my business I did in the morning; and in the
evening to Whitehall, where Ifind Sir W. Coventry all alone a great
while. with the Duke of York in the King’s drawing-room, they
two talking together all alone, which did mightily please me; then I
did get W. Coventry (the Duke of York being gone) aside, and
there read over my paper; which he liked and corrected, and tells me
it will be hard to escape, though the thing be never so fair, to have it
voted a miscarriage; but did advise me and my Lord Brouncker,
who coming by did join with us, to prepare some members in it;
which we shall do.
