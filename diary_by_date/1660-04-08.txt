Lords day. Very calm again and Ipretty well, but my head ached
all day. About noon set sail; in our way I saw many wracks and
masts, which are now the greatest guides for ships. We had a brave
wind all the afternoon. And overtook two good merchantmen that
overtook us yesterday, going to the East Indys, and the lieutenant
and IJlay out of his window with his glass, looking at the women
that were on board them, being pretty handsome. I and Will Howe,
the surgeon, parson, and Balty supped in the Lieutenant’s cabin and
afterward sat disputing, the parson for and I against extemporary
prayer very hot.
