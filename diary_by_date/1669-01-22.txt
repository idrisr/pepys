Up and with W. Hewer to Whitehall, and there attended the
Duke of York; and thence to the Exchange, in the way calling at
several places on occasions relating to my feast tomorrow, on
which my mind is now set — as, how to get a new looking-glass for
my dining-room, and some pewter and good wine against
tomorrow. And so home, where Ihad the looking-glass set up; cost
me 617s. 6d. And here at the Change I met with Mr. Dancre, the
famous lanskip painter — with whom I was on Wednesdy; and he
took measure of my panels in my dining-room, where in the four I
intend to have the four houses of the King — Whitehall, Hampton
court, Greenwich — and Windsor. He gone, I to dinner with my
people, and so to my office to despatchalittle business; and then
home to look after things against tomorrow. And among other
things, was mightily pleased with the fellow that came to lay the
cloth and fold the napkins — which I like so well, as that I am
resolved to give him 4os. to teach my wife to doit. So to supper,
with much kindness between me and my wife, which nowadays is
all my care; and so to bed.
