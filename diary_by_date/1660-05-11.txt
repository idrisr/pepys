Up very early in the morning. And so about a great deal of
business, in order to our going hence today. This morning we
begun to pull down all the State’s arms in the fleet — having first sent
to Dover for painters and others to come to set up the King’s. After
dinner we set sail from the Downes, Ileaving my boy to go to Deale
for my linen. It blew very hard all this night, that I was afeared of
my boy. About 11 at night came the boats from Deale with great
store of provisions; by the same token John Goods told me that
above 20 of the fowle are smothered. But my boy was put on board
the Northwich. To bed.
