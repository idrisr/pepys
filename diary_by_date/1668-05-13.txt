Up and by water to Whitehall, and so to Sir H. Cholmlys,
who not being up, I made a short visit to Sir W. Coventry, and he
and I through the park to Whitehall; and thence Iback into the park
and there met Sir H. Cholmly, and he andI to Sir St. Fox’s; where
we met and considered the business of the Excize, how far it is
908
charged in reference to the payment of the Guards and Tanger.
Thence he and I walked to Westminster hall and there took a turn, it
being holiday; and so back again, and I to the Mercers and my
tailor’s abouta stuff suit that Iam going to make; and thence at noon
to Hercules Pillars and there dined alone. And so to Whitehall,
some of us, attended the Duke of York as usual and so to attend the
Council about the business of Hemskirke’s project of building a
ship that shall [sail] two foot for one of any other ship — which the
Council did agree to be put in practice, the King to give him, if it
proves good, 5o0ool in hand and 15000! more in seven years — which,
for my part, I think a piece of folly for them to meddle with,
because the secret cannot be long kept. So thence after Council,
having drunk some of the King’s wine and water with Mr.
Chevins, my Lord Brouncker, and some others; I by water to the
Old Swan and there to Michells and did see her and drink there; but
he being there, yo no puede besar la. And so back again by water to
Spring garden all alone, and walked a
little; and so back again home
and therea little to my viall; and so to bed, Mrs. Turner having sat
and supped with me. This morning, I hear that last night Sir Tho.
Teddiman, poor man, did die by a thrush in his mouth — a good
man, and stout and able, and much lamented; though people do
make a
little mirth and say, asI believe it did in good part, that the
business of the Parliament did break his heart, or at least put him
into this fever and disorder that caused his death.
