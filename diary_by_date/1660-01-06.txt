This morning Mr. Sheply and I did eat our breakfasts at Mrs.
Harpers, my brother John being with me, upon a cold turkey pie
and a goose; from whence I went to my office, where we paid
money to the soldiers till one of the clock, at which time we made
an end; and I went home and took my wife and went to my Cosen
Tho. Pepys’s and found them just sat down to dinner, which was
very good; only the venison pasty was palpable beef, which was not
handsome. After dinner I took my leave, leaving my wife with my
cousin Stradwick, and went to Westminster to Mr. Vines, where
George and I fiddled a good while, Dick and his wife (who was
lately brought to bed) and her sister being there; but Mr. Hudson
not coming according to his promise, I went away; and calling at
my house on the wench, I took her and the lanthorn with me to my
cousin Stradwick. Where, after a good supper, there being there my
father, mother, brothers, and sister, my cousin Scot and his wife,
Mr. Drawwater and his wife and-her brother, Mr. Stradwick, we
had a brave cake brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was queen
and Mr. Stradwick was king. After that, my wife and I bid Adieu
and came home, it being still a great frost.
