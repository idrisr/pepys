Pierce the Chyrurgeon tells me that my Lady Castlemayne is
with child; but though it be the King’s, yet her Lord being still in
towne and sometime seeing of her, though never to eat or lie
together, it will be laid to him. He tells me also how the Duke of
York is smitten in love with my Lady Chesterfield (a virtuous lady,
daughter of my Lord of Ormond); and so much, that the Duchesse
of Yorke hath complained to the King and her father about it, and
my Lady Chesterfield is gone into the country for it. At all which I
am sorry; but it is the effect of idlenesse and having nothing else to
imploy their great spirits upon.
