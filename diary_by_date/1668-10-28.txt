I by coach towards the King’s playhouse; and meeting W.
How, took him with me and there saw The Citty Match, a play not
acted these 30 years, and buta silly play. The King and Court there.
The house mighty full. So I to Whitehall, and there all the evening
on the Queen’s side; and it being a most summerlike day anda
fine
warm evening, the Italians came in a barge under the leads before
the Queen’s drawing-room, and so the Queen and ladies went out
and heard it for almost an hour; and it was endeed very good
together but yet there was but one voice that alone did appear
considerable, and that was Seignor Joanni. This done, by and by
they went in; and here I saw Mr. Sidny Mountagu kiss the Queen’s
hand; who was mighty kind to him — and the ladies looked mightily
on him, and the King came by and by and did talk to him. So I away
by coach with Ald. Backewell home, who is mighty kind to me,
more then ordinary, in his expressions. But I do hear this day what
troubles me: that Sir W. Coventry is quite out of play. So home to
read and sup; and to bed.
Here the diary breaks offuntil 11 October, twelve pages being left blank for
entries that were presumably never made. No rough notes survive, but from
other sources we know that Pepys made two journeys at this time — one to
Hampshire to meet Sandwich on his return from Spain, and the other to
East Anglia, in the course ofwhich he brought his wife back to London on
10 October.
