1668-12-27

Lords day. Walked to Whitehall and there saw the King at
chapel; but stayed not to hear anything, but went to walk in the
park with W. Hewer, who was with me; and there, among others,
met with Sir G. Downing and walked with him an hour, talking of
business and how the late war was managed, there being nobody to
take care of it; and telling how when he was in Holland, he had so
good spies, that he hath had the keys taken out of De Witts pocket
when he was a-bed, and his closet opened and papers brought to
him and left in his hands for an [hour], and carried back and laid in
the place again and the keys put into his pocket again. He says he
hath alway had their most private debates that have been, but
between two or three of the chief of them, brought to him in an
hour after, and an hour after that hath sent word thereof to the King
— but nobody here regarded them. But he tells me the sad news that
he is out of all expectations that ever the debts of the Navy will be
paid, if the Parliament doth not enable the King to do it by money;
all they can hope for to do out of the King’s revenue being but to
keep our wheels a-going on present services, and, ifthey can, to cut
off the growing Interest — which is a sad story, and grieves me to the
heart. So home, my coach coming for me, and there find Balty and
Mr. How, who dined with me; and there my wife andIfell out a
little about the foulness of the linen of the table, but were friends
presently; but she cried, poor heart, which I was troubled for,
though I did not give her one hard word.
