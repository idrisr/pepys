Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning sitting. At
noon home to dinner, and then to the office, the yard being very full
of women (I believe above 300) coming to get money for their
husbands and friends that are prisoners in Holland; and they lay
clamouring and swearing, and cursing us, that my wife and I were
afeared to send a venison-pasty that we have for supper tonight to
the cook’s to be baked, for fear of their offering violence to 1t—but it
went, and no hurt done. Then I took an opportunity, when they
were all gone into the foreyard, and slipped into the office and there
busy all the afternoon. But by and by the women got into the
garden, and came all to my closet window and there tormented me;
and I confess, their cries were so sad for money, and laying down
the condition of their families and their husbands, and what they
have done and suffered for the King, and how ill they are used by
us, and how well the Duch are used here by the allowance of their
masters, and what their husbands are offered to serve the Duch
abroad, that I do most heartily pity them, and was ready to cry to
hear them — but cannot help them; however, when the rest was
gone, I did call one to me, that I heard complain only and pity her
husband, and did give her some money; and she blessed me and
went away.
