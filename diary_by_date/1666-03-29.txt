All the morning hard at the office. At noon dined, and then
out to Lumbard street to look after the getting in of some money
that is lodged there of mine in Viner’s hands, I having no mind to
have it lie there longer. So back again and to the office, where, and
at home, about public and private business and accounts till past 12
at night, and so to bed. This day poor Jane,’ my oldlittle Jane, came
to us again, to my wife’s and my great content; and we hope to take
mighty pleasure in her, she having all the marks and qualities of a
good and loving and honest servant — she coming by force away
from the other place where she hath lived ever since she went from
us, and at our desire — her late mistress having used all the
stratagems she could to keep her.
