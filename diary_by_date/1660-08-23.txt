To the Admiralty chamber, where we and Mr. Coventry
have a meeting about several businesses. Among others, it was
moved that Phin. Pett (kinsman to the Commissioner) of Chatham
should be suspended his imployment till he had answered to some
articles put in against him; as, that he should formerly say that the
King was a bastard and his mother a whore. Thence to Westminster
hall, where I met with my father Bowyer’ and Mr. Spicer, and
them I took to the Leg in King’s street and did give them a dish or
two of meat; and so away to the Privy Seale, where the King being
out of Towne, we have had nothing to do these two days. To
Westminster hall, where I met with W. Symons, T. Doling and
Mr. Booth, and with them to the Dogg, where we eat a Muske
millon (the first that I have eat this year) and were very merry with
W. Symons, calling him Mr. Deane, because of the Deanes lands
_ that his uncle had left him, which are like to be lost all. Thence
home by water; and very late at night writing letters to my Lord to
Hinchingbrooke and also to the Vice-Admirall in the Downes; and
so to bed.
