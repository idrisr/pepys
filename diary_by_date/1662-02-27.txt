This morning came Mr Berchensha to me; and in our
discourse, I finding that he cries up his rules for most perfect
(though I do grant them to be very good, and the best I believe that
ever yet were made) and that I could not persuade him to grant
wherein they were somewhat lame, we fell to angry words, so that
ina pet he flung out of my chamber and Inever stopped him, being
entended to have put him off today whether this had happened or
no, because I think I have all the rules that he hath to give, and so
there remains nothing but practice now to do me good ~and it is not
for me to continue with him at 5/ per mensem. So Isettled to put his
rules all in fair order in a book, which was my work all the morning
till dinner. After dinner to the office till late at night; and so home to
write by the post, and so to bed.
