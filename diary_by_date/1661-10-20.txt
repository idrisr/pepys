Lordsday. At home in bed all the morning to ease my late
tumour; but up to dinner, and much offended in mind at a proud
trick my man Will: hath got, to keep his hatt on in the house; but I
will not speak of it to him today, but I fear I shall be troubled with
his pride and lazinesse, though in other things he is good enough.
To church in the afternoon, where a sleepy presbyter preached.
And then to Sir W. Batten, who is to go to Portsmouth tomorrow
too, to wait upon the Duke of Yorke, who goes to take possession
and to set in order the Garrison there. Supped at home and to bed.
