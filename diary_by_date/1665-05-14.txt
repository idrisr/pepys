Lords day. Up, and with my wife to church, it being
Whitsunday. My wife very fine in a new yellow birds-eye Hood, as
the fashion is now. We had a most sorry sermon. So home to
dinner, my mother having her new suit brought home, which
makes her very fine. After dinner my wife and she and Mercer to
Tho. Pepys’s wife’s christening of his first child. And I took a coach
and to Wanstead, the house where Sir H. Mildmay did [live] and
now Sir Rob. Brookes lives, having bought it of the Duke of
Yorke, it being forfeited to him. A fine seat, but an old-fashion
house and being not full of people, looks desolately. Thence to
Walthamstow, where Sir W. Batten by and by came home, I
walking up and down the house and garden with my Lady, very
pleasant. Then to supper, very merry; and then back by coach by
dark night —I, all the afternoon in the coach, reading the treasonous
book of the Court of King James, printed a great while ago and
worth reading, though ill intended. As soon as came home, upon a
letter from Duke of Albemarle, I took boat, at about 12 at night,
and down the River in a galley, my boy and I, down to the Hope,
and so up again, sleeping and waking with great pleasure; my
business, to call upon every one of our victualling ships to set them
a-going.
