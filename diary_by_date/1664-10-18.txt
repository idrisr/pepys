Up and to the office; where among other things, we made a
very great contract with Sir W. Warren for 3000 load of Timber. At
noon dined at home. In the afternoon to the Fishery. Thence I with
Mr. Gray in his coach to Whitehall; but the King and Duke being
abroad, we returned to Somersett house. In discourse, I find him a
very worthy and studious gentleman in the business of Trade; and
among other things, he observed well to me how it is not the
greatest wits but the steady man that is a good merchant: he
instanced in Ford and Cocke, the last of whom he values above all
men as his oracle, as Mr. Coventry doth Mr. Jolliffe. He says that it
is concluded among merchants, that where a Trade hath once been
and doth decay, it never recovers again; and therefore, that the
manufacture of Cloath of England will never come to esteem again.
That among other faults, Sir Rd. Ford cannot keepa Secret; and that
it is so much the part ofa merchant to be guilty of that fault, that the
Duke of Yorke is resolved to commit no more secrets to the
merchants of the Royall Company. That Sir Ellis Layton is, for a
speech of forty words, the wittiest man that ever he knew in his life;
but longer, he is nothing; his judgment being nothing at all, but his
wit most absolute. At Somersett house he carried me in and there I
434
saw the Queenes new rooms, which are most stately and nobly
furnished; and there I saw her, and the Duke of Yorke and Duchesse
were there.
