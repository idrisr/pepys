After dinner to St. James’s, but missed Sir W. Coventry; and
so home and there find my wife in a dogged humour for my not
dining at home, andI did give her a pull by the nose and some ill
words, which she provoked me to by something she spoke, that we
fell extraordinarily out; insomuch, that Igoing to the office to avoid
further anger, she fallowed me in a devilish manner thither, and
with much ado I got her into the garden out of hearing, to prevent
shame; and so home, and by degrees I found it necessary to calme
her, and did; and then to the office, where pretty late, and then to
walk with her in the garden, and so to supper and pretty good
friends; and so to bed — with my mind very quiet.
