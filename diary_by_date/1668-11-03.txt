Up and all the morning at the office. At noon to dinner; and
then to the office and there busy till 12 at night, without much pain
to my eyes; but I did not use them to read or write, and so did hold
out very well. So home, and there to supper; and I observed my
wife to eye my eyes whether I did ever look upon Deb; which I
could not but do now and then (and to my grief did see the poor
wretch look on me and see me look on her, and then let drop a tear
or two; which doth make my heart relent at this minute that I am
writing this, with great trouble of mind, for she is endeed my
sacrifice, poor girl); and my wife did tell me in bed, by the by, of my
looking on other people, and that the only way is to put things out
of sight; and this I know she means by Deb, for she tells me that her
aunt was here on Monday and she did tell her of her desire of parting
with Deb; but in such kind terms on both sides, that my wife is
mightily taken with her. I see it will be, and it is but necessary; and
therefore, though it cannot but grieve me, yet I must bring my
mind to give way to it.
