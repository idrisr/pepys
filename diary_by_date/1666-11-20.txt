After church, home, where I met Mr. Gregory who] did then
agree with to come to teach my wife to play on the Viall; and he
being an able and sober man, Iam mighty glad of it. He had dined,
therefore went away, and1 to dinner; and after dinner by coach to
Barkeshire house, and there did get a very great meeting, the Duke
of York being there, and much business done, though not in
proportion to the greatness of the business, and my Lord Chancel-
lor sleeping and snoring the greater part of the time. Among other
things, I declared the state of our Credit as to tallies to raise money
694
by. And there was an order for payment of 5000! to Mr. Gauden,
out of which I hope to get something against Christmas. Here we
sat late, and here I did hear that there are some troubles like to be in
Scottland,' there being a discontented party already risen, that hath
seized on the Governor of Dumfreeze and imprisoned him. But the
story is yet very uncertain, and therefore I set no great weight on it.
I home, by Mr. Gauden in his coach; and so with great pleasure to
spend the evening at home upon my Lyra Viall, and then to supper
and to bed — with mighty peace of mind, and a hearty desire that I
had but what Ihave quietly in the country — but Ifear Ido at this day
see the best that either I, or the rest of our nation, will ever see.
