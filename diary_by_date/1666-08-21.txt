Late at the office; and then home and there find Mr. Batelier
and his sister Mary, and we sat chatting a great while, talking of
Wiches and Spirits; and he told me of his own knowledge, being
with some others at Bourdeaux, making a bargain with another
655
man at a taverne for some Claretts, they did hire a fellow to thunder
(which he had the art of doing upon a deale board) and to rain and
hail; that is, make the noise of — so as did give them a pretence of
undervaluing their Merchants wines, by saying this thunder would
spoil and turn them — which was so reasonable to the Merchant that
he did abate two pistolls per Ton for the wine, in belief of that —
whereas, going out, there was no such thing. This Batelier did see
and was the cause of, to his profit, as is above said. By and by broke
up, and to bed.
