Up betimes; and all day and afternoon, without going out,
busy upon my great letter to the Duke of York, which goes on to
my content. W. Hewer and Gibson I imploy with me in it. This
week my people wash over the water, and so I little company at
home. In the evening, being busy above, a great cry I hear, and go
down; and what should it be but Jane, ina fit of direct raveing which
lasted half-an-hour; beyond four or five of our strength to keep her
down. And when allcame to all, a fit ofjealousy about Tom, with
whomshe is in love. So at night, I and my wife and W. Hewer
called them to us, and there I did examine all the thing, and them in
league. She in love, and he hath got her to promise him to marry,
and he is now cold in it—so that Jmust rid my hands of them. Which
troubles me, and the more because my head is now busy upon other
greater things. I am vexed also to be told by W. Hewer that he is
summoned to Commissioners of Accounts about receiving a
present of 30/ from Mr. Mason the timber merchant — though there
be no harmin it that will appear on his part — he having done them
several lawful kindnesses and never demanded anything, as they
themselfs have this day declared to the Commissioners, they being
forced up by the discovery of somebody that they in confidence had
once told it to. So to supper, vexed and my head full of care; and so
to bed.
