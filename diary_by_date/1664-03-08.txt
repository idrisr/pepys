Up, with some little discontent with my wife upon her saying
that she had got and used some puppy-dog water, being put upon
it by a desire of my aunt Wight to get some for her; who hath a
mind, unknown to her husband, to get some for her ugly face. I to
the office, where we sat all the morning. Thence home, whither
Luellin came and dined with me; but we made no long stay at
dinner, for Heraclius being acted, which my wife and I have a
mighty mind to see, we do resolve, though not exactly agreeing
with the letter of my vowe, yet altogether with the sense, to see
another this month — by going hither instead of that at Court, there
having been none conveniently since I made my vow for us to see
there, nor like to be this Lent; and besides, we did walk home on
purpose to make this going as cheap as that would have been to
have seen one at Court; and my conscience knows that it is only
the saving of money and the time also that I entend by my oaths,
and this hath cost no more of either — so that my conscience before
God doth, after good consultation and resolution of paying my
forfeit did my conscience accuse me of breaking my vow, I do not
find myself in the least apprehensive that I have done any vyolence
. to my oaths. The play hath one very good passage well managed
in it; about two persons pretending and yet denying themselfs
to be son to the Tyrant Phocas and yet heire of Mauricius to
the Crowne. The guarments like Romans very well. The little
361
guirle’ is come to act very prettily and spoke the epilogue most
admirably. But at the beginning, at the drawing up of the Curtaine,
there was the finest Scene of the Emperor and his people about him,
standing in their fixed and different postures in their Roman habits,
above all that ever I yet saw at any of the Theatres. Walked home,
calling to see my brother Tom, who is in bed and J doubt very ill -
ofaconsumption. To my office a while; and so home to supper and
to bed.
