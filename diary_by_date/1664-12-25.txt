Lords day and Christmas Day. Up (my wife’s eye being ill still of
the blow I did in a passion give her on Monday last) to church alone
454
— where Mr. Mills, a good sermon. To dinner at home, where very
pleasant with my wife and family. After dinner, Ito Sir W. Batten’s
and there received so much good usage (as Ihave of late done) from
him and my Lady, obliging me and my wife, according to promise,
to come and dine with them tomorrow with our neighbours, that I
was in pain all the day, and night too after, to know how to order
the business of my wife’s not going. Thence to the French church;
but coming too late, I returned and to Mr. Rawlinson’s church,
where I heard a good sermon of one that I remember was at Pauls
with me, his name Maggett. And very great store of fine women
there is in this church, more then Iknow anywhere else about us. So
home and to my chamber, looking over and setting in order my
papers and books; and so to supper, and then to prayers and to bed.
