Upandto the office ail the morning; and then home to dinner,
having this day a new girle come to us in the room of Nell, who is
lately, about four days since, gone away, being grown lazy and
proud. This girl to stay only till we have a boy, which I intend to
keep when Ihave a coach; which I am now about. At this time, my
wife and I mighty busy laying out money in dressing up our best
chamber and thinking of a coach and coachman and horses &c., and
the more because of Creed’s being now married to Mrs. Pickering;
a thing Icould never have expected, but it is done about seven or ten
days since —as I hear out of the country. At noon home to dinner,
and my wife and Harman and girl abroad to buy things; and I
walked out to several places to pay debts, and among other things
to look out for a coach; and saw many, and did light on one, for
948
which Ibid sol, which doth please me mightily — and Ibelieve Ishall
have it. So to my tailor’s and the New Exchange, and so by coach
home; and there, having this day bought the Queene ofArragon play,
I did get my wife and W. Batelier to read it over this night by 11 a-
clock, and so to bed.
