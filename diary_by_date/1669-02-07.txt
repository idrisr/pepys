Lords day. My wife mighty peevish in the morning about my
lying unquietly a-nights, and she will have it that it is a late practice,
from my evil thoughts in my dreams; and I do often find that in my
dreams she doth lay her hand upon my cockerel to observe what she
can. And mightily she is troubled about it, but all blew over; and I
up and to church, and so home to dinner, where she in a worse fit,
which lasted all afternoon, and shut herself up in her closet; and I
mightily grieved and vexed, and could not get her to tell me what
ayled her, or to let me into her closet; but at last she did, where I
found her crying on the ground, and I could not please her; but I did
at last find that she did plainly expound it to me: it was that she did
believe me false to her with Jane, and did rip up three or four most
silly circumstances, of her not rising till I came out of my chamber
and her letting me thereby see her dressing herself, and that I must
needs go into her chamber and was naught with her; which was so
silly, and so far from truth, that I could not be troubled at it, though
I could not wonder at her being troubled, ifshe had these thoughts.
And therefore she would lie from me, and caused sheets to be puton
in the blue room and would have Jane to lie with her, lest I should
come to her.
