Up betimes, and in my chamber most of the morning, setting
things to right there, my Journall and accounts with my father and
brother. Then to the office a little, and so to Lumberd street to
borrow a little money upon a tally, but cannot. Thence to
Exchequer, and there after much wrangling got consent that I
should havea great tally broken into little ones. Thence to Hales’s
to see how my father’s picture goes on, which pleases me mighty
well, though I
find again, as I did in Mrs. Pierces, that a picture may
have more of likeness in the first or second working then it shall
have when finished; though this is very well, and to my full content,
but so itis. And contrarily, mine was not so like at the first, second,
or third sitting as it was afterward. Thence to my Lord Bellasyse by
invitation, and there dined with him and his lady and daughter; and
at dinner there played to us a young boy lately come from France,
where he had been learning a year or two on the viallin, and plays
finely. But impartially, I do not find any goodness in their ayres
(though very good) beyond ours, when played by the same hand; I
observed in several of Baptiste’s (the present great composer) and
our Bannisters. But it was pretty to see how passionately my Lord’s
daughter loves music, the most that ever I saw creature in my life.
