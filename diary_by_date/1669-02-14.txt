Lords day. Up and by coach to Sir W. Coventry; and there, he
taking physic, I with him all the morning, full of very good
discourse of the Navy and public matters, to my great content;
wherein I find him doubtful that all will be bad; and for his part, he
tells me he takes no more care for anything more then in the
987
Treasury; and that that being done, he goes to cards and other
delights, as plays, and in summer time to Bowles; but here he did
show me two or three old books of the Navy of my Lord
Northumberland’s times, which he hath taken many good notes
out of for justifying the Duke of York and us in many things
wherein perhaps precedent will be necessary to produce— which did
give me great content.
