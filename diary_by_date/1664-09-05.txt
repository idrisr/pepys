Upand to St. James and there did our business with the Duke -
where all our discourse of war, in the highest measure. Prince Robt.
was with us — who is fitting himself to go to sea in the Heneretta.
And afterward in Whitehall, I met him and Mr. Gray and he spoke
to me; and in other discourse, says he, “God damn me, I can answer
but for one ship, and in that Iwill do my part; for it is not in that as in
[an] army, where a man can command everything.” By and by toa
committee for the Fishery, the Duke of Yorke there — where after
Duke was made Secretary, we fell to name a committee; whereof I
was willing to be one because I would have my hand in that
business, to understand it and be known in doing something in it.
And so after cutting out work for that committee, we ris; and I to
my wife to Unthankes, and with her from shop to shop, laying out
421
near rol this morning in clothes for her. And so I to the Change,
where a while, and so home and to dinner, and thither came W.
Bowyer and dined with us; but strange to see how he could not
endure onyons in sauce to lamb, but was overcome with the sight of
it and so was forced to make his dinner of an egg or two. He tells us
how Mrs. Lane is undone by her marrying so bad, and desires to
speak with me; which I know is wholly to get me to do something
for her to get her husband a place which he is in no wise fit for. After
dinner Idown to Woolwich witha galley, and then to Deptford and
so home —all the way reading Sir J. Suck([l]ings Aglaura, which
methinks is but a mean play — nothing of design in it.
