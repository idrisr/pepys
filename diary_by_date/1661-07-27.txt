To Westminster; where at Mr. Mountagu’s chamber Iheard a
Frenchman play upon the Gittar most extreme well; though, at the
best, methinks it is but a bawble. From thence to Westminster hall.
In the Lobby I spoke with Mr. George Mountagu. He told me in
discourse that my Lord Chancellor is much envyed and that many
great men, such as the Duke of Buckingham and my Lord of
Bristoll, do endeavour to undermine him. And that he believes it
will not be done, for that the King (though he loves him not in the
way of a companion, as he doth these young gallants that can
answer him in his pleasures), yet cannot be without him for his
policy and service. From thence to the Wardrobe, where my wife
met me, it being my Lord of Sandwiches Birthday. And so we had
many friends here, Mr. Townsend and his wife and Capt. Ferrers’
lady and Capt. Isham, and were very merry and hada good venison
pasty. After dinner Mr. Townsend was called upon by Capt.
Cooke; so we three went to a taverne hard by and there he did give
us a song or two; and without doubt, he hath the best manner of
singing in the world.
