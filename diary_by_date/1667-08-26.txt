Up; and Greeting came and I reckoned with him for his
teaching of my wife and me upon the Flagielette to this day, and
so paid him off, having as much as he can teach us. Then to the
office, where we sat upon a perticular business all the morning,
and my Lord Anglesey with us; who, and my Lord Brouncker, do
bring us news how my Lord Chancellors seal is to be taken away
from him today. The thing is so great and sudden to me, that it
put me into a very great admiration what should be the meaning
of it; and they do not own that they know what it should be. But
this is certain: that the King did resolve it on Saturday, and did
yesterday send the Duke of Albemarle (the only man fit for those
works) to him for his purse; to which the Chancellor answered
that he received it from the King, and would deliver it to the
King’s own hand, and so civilly returned the Duke of Albemarle
without it; and this morning my Lord Chancellor is to be with the
King, to come to an end in that business. And it is said that the
King doth say that he will have the Parliament meet, and that it
will prevent much trouble by having of him out of their envy, by
his place being taken away — for that all their envy will be at him.
It is said also that my Lord Chancellor answers that he desires he
may be brought to his trial if he have done anything to lose his
office; and that he will be willing, and is most desirous, to lose that
and his head both together. Upon what terms they parted nobody
knows; but the Chancellor looked sad, he says.
