' Up, and presently my wife up with me, which she professedly
now doth every day to dress me, that Imay not see Willett; and doth
eye me whether [cast my eye upon her or no. And doth keep me
from going into the room where she is among the Upholsters at
1. Pepys here transposes the entries for the 5th and 6th — ‘my mind being now so
troubled’, he adds after the latter entry, ‘that it is no wonder thatI fall into this
mistake more then ever Idid in my life before’. He later confuses his accounts of the

work in our blue chamber. At the office all the morning; and so to
dinner, my wife with me, but so as I durst not look upon the girl;
though God knows, notwithstanding all my protestations, I could
not keep my mind from desiring it. After dinner to the office again
and there did some business; and then by coach to see Roger Pepys
at his lodgings next door to Arundell house, a barber’s. And there I
did see a book which my Lord Sandwich hath promised one to me
of — a description of the Escuriall in Spain; which I have a great
desire to have, though Itook it fora finer book when he promised it
me. With him to see my Cosen Turner and The[oph]., and there sat
and talked, they being newly come out of the country; and here
pretty merry, and with The[oph]. to show her a coach at Mr.
Povy’s man’s, she being in want ofone; and so back again with her
and then home by coach, with my mind troubled and finding no
content, my wife still troubled, nor can be at peace while the girl is
there; which I am troubled at on the other side. We passed the
evening together, and then to bed and slept ill, she being troubled
and troubling me in the night with talk and complaint upon the old
business.
