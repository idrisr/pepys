Lords day. Early in the morning, I set my books that Ibrought
home yesterday up in order in my study. Thence, forth to Mr.
Harpers to drink a draught of purle; whither by appointment
Monsieur L’impertinent who did intend too, upon my desire, to go
along with me to St. Bartholomew’s to hear one Mr. Sparkes; but it
raining very hard, we went to Mr. Gunings and heard an excellent
sermon. And speaking of the character that the Scripture gave of
Ann the mother of the Blessed Virgin, he did there speak largely in
commendation of Widowhood, and not as we do to marry two or
three wifes or husbands, one after another. Here I met with Mr.
Moore and went home with him to dinner, where he told me the
discourse that happened between the secluded members and the
members of the House before Monke last Friday. How the secluded
said that they did not entend by coming in to express revenge upon
these men, but only to meet and dissolve themselfs, and only to
issue writs for a free Parliament. He told me that there is great
likelihood that the secluded members will come in, and so Mr.
18
Crew and my Lord are likely to be great men, at which I was very
glad. After dinner there was many secluded members come in to
Mr. Crew; which, it being the Lord’s day, did make Mr. Moore
believe that there was something extraordinary in the business.
Hence home and brought my wife to Mr. Messums to hear him.
And indeed he made a very good sermon; but only, too eloquent for
a pulpit. After sermon, to my father’s and fell in discourse
concerning our going to Cambrige the next week with my Brother
John.
