Up by 4a-clock to go with Sir W. Batten to Woolwich, and
Sir
J.Mennes; which we did, though not before 6 or 7 by their lying
a-bed. Our business was to survey the new wharfe building there,
303
in order to the giving more to him that doth it, Mr. Randall, then
contracted for; but I see no reason for it, though it be well done, yet
not better then contracted to be. Here we eat and drunk at the Clerk
of the Cheques; and in taking water at the Tower gate, we drank a
cup of strong water, which I did out of pure conscience to my
health; and I think is not excepted by my oaths, but it is a thing |
shall not do again, hoping to have no such occasion. After breakfast
there, Mr. Castle and I walked to Greenwich, and in our way met
some Gypsys who would needs tell me my fortune, and I suffered
one of them — who told me many things common, as others do, but
bid me beware of a John and a Thomas, for they did seek to do me
hurt. And that somebody should be with me this day sennit to
borrow money of me, but I should lend them none. She got
ninepence of me; and soI left them.
