My Lady Jem is beyond expectation come to Dagenhams,
where Mr. Carteret is to go to visit her tomorrow; and my proposal
of waiting on him, he being to go alone to all persons strangers to
him, was well accepted and soI go with him. But Lord, to see how
kind my Lady Carteret is to her — sends her most rich Jewells, and
provides bedding and things of all sorts most richly for her — which
makes my Lady and me out of our wits almost, to see the kindness
she treats us all with—as if they would buy the young lady. Thence
away home; and foreseeing my being abroad two days, did sit up
late, making of letters ready against tomorrow and other things;
and so to bed —-to be up betimes by the help of a larum-wach, which
by chance I borrowed of my watchmaker today while my own is
mending.
