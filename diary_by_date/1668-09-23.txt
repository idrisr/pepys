At my office busy all the morning. At noon comes Mr.
Eveling to me about some business with the office, and there in
discourse tells me of his loss, to the value of 500l, which he hath met
with ina late attempt of making of Bricks upon an adventure with
others, by which he presumed to have gota great deal of money —so
that I see the most ingenious men may sometimes be mistaken. So
to the Changea
little, and then home to dinner; and then by water to
Whitehall to attend the Commissioners of the Treasury with Ald.
Backwell about 10000! he is to lend us for Tanger. And then up to a
committee of the Council, where was the Duke of York; and they
did give us, the Officers of the Navy, the proposals of the several
bidders for the victualling of the Navy, for us to give them our
answer to which is the best, and whether it be better to victual by
commission or contract — and to bring them our answer by Friday
afternoon — which is a great deal of work. So thence back with Sir
J.
Mennes home, and came after us Sir W. Penn and Lord Brouncker,
and we fell to the business; and Ilate when they were gone, to digest
somethingofit; and so to supper and to bed.
