Dined at home and then to the office, where we sat all the
afternoon. And at night home and spent the evening with my wife,
and she and I did jangle mightily about her cushions that she
285
wrought with worsteds the last year, which are too little for any
use; but were good friends by and by again. But one thing I must
confess I do observe, which I did not before; which is, that I cannot
blame my wife to be now in a worse humour then she used to be,
for lam taken up in my talk with Ashwell, who isa very witty girle,
that I am not so fondof her as I used and ought to be; which now I
do perceive, I will remedy.
