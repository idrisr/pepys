Up and by water to the Exchequer, where I got my tallies
finished for the last Quarter for Tanger; and having paid all my fees,
I to the Swan, whither I sent for some oysters; and thither comes
Mr. Falconbrige and Spicer and many more clerks, and there we eat
and drank, and a great deal of their sorry discourse; and so parted,
and I by coach home, meeting Balty in the street about Charing
cross, walking; which I was glad to see, and spoke to him about his
mustering business, Ibeing now to give an account how the several
muster-maisters have behaved themselfs; and so home to dinner,
where finding the cloth laid, and much crumpled but clean, I grew
angry and flung the trenchers about the room, and in a mighty heat I
was; so aclean cloth was laid, and my poor wife very patient; and so
to dinner, and in comes Mrs. Barbara Shelden, now Mrs. Wood,
and dined with us. She mighty fine — and lives, I perceive, mighty
happily; which I am glad for her sake, but hate her husband for a
blockhead in his choice.’ So away after dinner, leaving my wife and
her, and by water to the Strand and so to the King’s playhouse,
where two acts were almost done when I came in; and there I sat
with my cloak about my face and saw the remainder of The Mayds
Tragedy — a good play, and well acted, especially by the younger
Marshall, which is become a pretty good actor. And is the first play
I have seen in either of the houses since before the great plague —
they having acted now about fourteen days publicly. But I was in
mighty pain lest I should be seen by anybody to be at a play. As
soon as done, I home and there to my office awhile; and then home
and spent the night evening my Tanger accounts, much to my
satisfaction; and then to supper, and mighty good friends with my
poor wife, and so to bed.
