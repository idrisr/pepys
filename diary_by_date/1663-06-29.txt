Up betimes and to my office; and by and by to the Temple and
290
there appointed to meet in the evening about my business. And
thence I walked home; and up and down the streets is cried mightily
the great victory got by the Portugalls against the Spaniards,’
where 10000 slain, 3 or 4000 taken prisoners, with all the artillery,
baggage, money, &c., and Don Johnof Austria forced to fly with a
man or two with him
— which is very great news. Thence home and
at my office all the morning, and so dined at home; and then by
water to St. James, but no meeting, today being holyday; but met
Mr. Creed in the park, and after a walk or two, discoursing his
business, I took leave of him in Westminster hall, whither we
walked; and then came again to the hall and fell in talk with Mrs.
Lane and after great talk that she never went abroad with any man as
she used heretofore to do, I with one word got her to go with me
and to meet me at the further Rhenish winehouse -— where I did give
her a Lobster and do so towse her and feel her all over, making her
believe how fair and good a skin she had; and endeed, she hath a
very white thigh and leg, but monstrous fat. When weary, I did
give over, and somebody having seen some of our dalliance, callec
aloud in the street, “‘Sir! why do you kiss the gentlewoman so?” and
flung a stone at the window — which vexed me — but I believe they
could not see my towsing her; and so we broke up and went out the
back way, without being observed I think.
