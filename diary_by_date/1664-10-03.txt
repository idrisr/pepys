Up. With Sir
J.Mennes by coach to St. James’s, and there all
the news now of very hot preparations for the Dutch; and being
with the Duke, he told us he was resolved to make a Tripp himself,
and that Sir W. Pen should go in the same ship — which honour,
God forgive me, I could grudge him for his knavery and
dissimulation, though I do not envy much the having the same
place myself. Talk also of great haste in the getting out another fleet
and building some ships; and now it is likely we have put one
another, by each other’s dalliance, past a retreate. Thence, with our
heads full of business, we broke up, and I to my barbers and there
only saw Jane and stroked her under the chin; and away to the
Exchange and there long about several businesses, hoping to get
money by them. And thence home to dinner and there found
Hawly. But meeting Bagwell’s wife at the office before I went
home, I took her into the office and there kissed her only. She
rebuked me for doing it; saying, that did I do so much to many
bodies else, it would bea stain to me. ButI do not see but she takes it
well enough; though in the main, I believe she is very honest. So
after some kind discourse, we parted, and I home to dinner; and
after dinner down to Deptford, where I found Mr. Coventry; and
there we made an experiment of Hollands and our Cordage and
ours out-did it a great deal, as my book of observations tells
perticularly. Here we were late. And so home together by water,
and I to my office, where late putting things in order.
