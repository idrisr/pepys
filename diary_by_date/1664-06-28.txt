Up; and this day put ona half-shirt first this summer, it being
very hot; and yet so ill-tempered I am grown, that I am afeared I
shall ketch cold while all the world is ready to melt away. To the
office all the morning. At noon to dinner at home. Then to my
office till the evening. Then out about several businesses; and then
by appointment to the Change and thence with my uncle Wight to
the Mum house; and there drinking, he doth complain of his wife
most cruelly, as the most troublesome woman in the world; and
how she will have her will, saying she brought him a portion and
God knows what — by which, with many instances more, Iperceive
they do livea sad life together. Thence to the Miter, and there came
Dr. Burnett to us and Mr. Maes. But the meeting was chiefly to
bring the Doctor and me together, and there I begin to have his
advice about my disease and then invited him to my house; and Iam
resolved to put myself into his hands. Here very late, but I drank
nothing, nor will — though he doth advise me to take care of cold
drinks. So home and to bed.
