Lay long in bed, troubled a little with wind, but not much. So
to the office and there all the morning. At noon to Sheriffe
Watermans to dinner, all of us men of the office in town — and our
wifes, my Lady Carteret and daughters, and Lady Batten, Pen, and
my wife, &c.; and very good cheer we had and merry. Musique at
and after dinner, and a fellow danced a jigg; but when the company
begin to dance, I came away, lest I should be taken out; and God
knows how my wife carried herself, but I left her to try her fortune.
So home, and late at the office; then home to supper and to bed.
