Lay pretty while, with some discontent, abed, even to the
having bad words with my wife, and blows too, about the ill
serving-up of our victuals yesterday; but all ended in love. And so I
rose and to my office, busy all the morning. At noon dined at home,
and then to my office again; and then abroad to look after Callicos
for Flaggs, and hope to get a small matter by my pains therein and
yet save the King a great deal of money. And so home to my office;
and there came Mr. Cocker and brought me a Globe of glasse and a
frame of oyled paper (as I desired), to show me the manner of his
gaining light to grave by and to lessen the glaringnesse of it at
pleasure, by an oyled paper. This I bought of him, giving him a
Crowne for it; and so, well satisfied, he went away and I to my
business again; and so home to supper, prayers, and to bed.
