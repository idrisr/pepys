Up, and thought to have gone with Lord Brouncker to Mr.
Hooke’s this morning betimes; but my Lord is taken ill of the
gowte, and says his new lodgings have infected him, he having
never had any symptoms of it till now. So walked to Gresham
College to tell Hooke that my Lord could not come; and so left
word, he being abroad; and I to St. James’s and thence with the
Duke of York to Whitehall, where the Board waited on him all the
morning; and so at noon with Sir Tho. Allen and Sir Ed. Scott and
1016
Lord Carlingford to the Spanish Embassadors, where I dined the
first time — the Oleo not so good as Shere’s. There was at the table,
himself and a Spanish Countess, a good, comely, and witty lady —
three fathers — and us. Discourse good and pleasant; and here was an
Oxford scholar in a Doctor’s of Laws gowne, where the Embassa-
dor lay when the Court was there, to salute him from the college
before his return to Spain. This man, though a gentle sort of
scholar, yet sat like a fool for want of French or Spanish; but only
Latin, which he spoke like a Englishman to one of the fathers. And
by and by, he and I to talk and the company very merry at my
defending Cambridge against Oxford: and I made much use of my
French and Spanish here, to my great content. But the dinner not
extraordinary at all, either for quantity or quality. Thence home,
where my wife ill of those upon the maid’s bed, and troubled at my
being abroad. SoI to the office, and there till night; and then to her,
and she read to me the Epistle of Cassandra, which is very good
endeed, and the better to her because recommended by Sheres. So
to supper, and I to bed.
