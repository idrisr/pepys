To the Privy Seale in the morning, but my Lord’ did not
come. So I went with Capt. Morrice at his desire into the King’s
Privy Kitchin to Mr. Sayres the Master-Cooke, and there we had a
good slice of beef or two to our breakfast. And from thence he took
us into the wine-cellar; where by my troth we were very merry, and
I drank too much wine - and all along had great and perticular
kindness from Mr. Sayre. But I drank so much wine that I was not
fit for business; and therefore, at noon I went and walked in
Westminster hall a while; and thence to Salsbury Court playhouse,
where was acted the first time Tis pitty shee’s a Whore—a simple play
and ill acted; only, it was my fortune to sit by a most pretty and
most ingenious lady, which pleased me much.
