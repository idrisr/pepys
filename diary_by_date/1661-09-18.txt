The next morning, up early and begun our march. The way
about Puckrige very bad; and my wife in the very last dirty place of
all got a fall but no hurt, though some dirt. At last she begun, poor
wretch, to be tired, andI to be angry at it; but Iwas to blame, for she
is a very good companion as long as she is well. In the afternoon we
got to Cambrige, where! left my wife at my Cosen Angiers, while I
went to Christ College and there find my brother in his chamber —
and talked with him; and so to the barbers and then to my wife again
and remounted for Impington. Where my Uncle received me and
my wife very kindly. And by and by, in comes my father. And we
supped and talked and were merry; but being weary and sleepy, my
wife and I to bed without talking with my father about our
business.
