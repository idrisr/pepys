St. Bartholomew’s day. This morning was proclaimed the peace
between us and the States of the United Provinces, and also of the
King of France and Denmarke, and in the afternoon the proclama-
tions were printed and came out. And at night the bells rung, but no
bonfires that I hear of anywhere, partly from the dearness of firing
but principally from the little content most people have in the
peace. All the morning at the office. At noon dined, and Creed with
me, at home. After dinner, we toa play and there saw The Cardinall
at the King’s House, wherewith Iam mightily pleased; but above all
with Becke Marshall. But it is pretty to observe how I look up and
down for and did espy Knepp; but durst not own it to my wife that I
saw her, for fear of angering her, who doth not like my kindness to
her — and so I was forced not to take notice of her. And so
821
homeward, leaving Creed at the Temple: and my belly now full
with Plays, that I do entend to bind myself to see no more till
Michaelmas. So with my wife to Mile end and there drank of Bides
ale, and so home; most of our discourse about our keeping a coach
the next year, which pleases my wife mightily; and if I continue as
able as now, it will save us money. This day camealetter from the
Duke of York to the Board, to invite us, which is as much as to
fright us, into the lending the King money; which is a poor thing
and most dishonourable—and shows in what a case we are at the end
of the war to our neighbours. And the King doth now declare
publicly to give Io per cent to all lenders; which makes some think
that the Dutch themselfs will send over money and lend it upon our
public faith, the Act of Parliament.' So home and to my office;
wrote a little and then home to supper and to bed.
