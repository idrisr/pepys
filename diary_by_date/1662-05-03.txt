Sir W. Penn and I by coach to St. James’s, and there to the
Dukes chamber, who hath been a-hunting this morning and is
come back again. To dinner to my Lady Sandwich; and Sir Tho.
Crewes children coming thither, I took them and all my Lady’s to
the Tower and showed them the lions and all that was to be shown,
and so took them to my house and there made much of them; and so
saw them back to my Lady’s — Sir Th. Crewes children being as
pretty and the best behaved that ever I saw of their age.
