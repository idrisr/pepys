At the office betimes (it being cold all night and this morning,
and a very great frost they say abroad; which is much, having had
no summer at all almost); where we sat, and in the afternoon also,
about settling the Establishment of the number of men borne on
ships, &c., till the evening; and after that, in my closet till late, and
quite tired with business, home to supper and to bed.
