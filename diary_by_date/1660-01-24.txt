In the morning to my office; where after I had drank my
morning draught at Will’s with Ethell and Mr. Stevens, I went and
told part of the excise money till 12 a-clock. And then called on my
wife and took her to Mr. Pierce’s, she in the way being exceedingly
troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it
being late. There when we came, we found Mrs. Carrick very fine,
and one Mr. Lucy, who called one another husband and wife; and
after dinner, a great deal of mad stir; there was pulling off Mrs.
Bride’s and Mr. Bridegroom’s ribbons, with a great deal of fooling
among them that I and my wife did not like; Mr. Lucy and several
other gentlemen coming in after dinner, swearing and singing as if
they were mad; only, he singing very handsomely.
