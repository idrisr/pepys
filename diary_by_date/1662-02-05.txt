earely at the office; Sir G. Carteret, the two Sir Wms and
myself all alone, reading over the Duke's Institucions for the
Settlement of our office. Whereof we read as much as concerns our
owne duties, and left the other officers for another time. | did move
several things for my purpose, and did ease my mind. At noon Sir
W. Pen dined with me; and after dinner, he andl and my wife to the
Theater and went in; but being there very earely, we went out again
to the next door and drank some Renish wine and Sugar; and so to
the House again and there saw Rule a Wife and havea Wife—very well
done; and here also I did look long upon my Lady Castlemayne,
who, notwithstanding her late sickness, continues a great beauty.
Home, and supped with Sir W. Pen and played at Cards with him;
and so home and to bed — putting some cataplasme to my testicle,
which begins to swell again.
