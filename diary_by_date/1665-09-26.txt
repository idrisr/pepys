Up by 5 a-clock and got post-horses and so set out for
Greenwich, calling and drinking at Dartford. Being come to
Greenwich, and shifting myself, Ito the office; from whence by and
by my Lord Bruncker and Sir Jo. Minnes set out toward Erith to
take charge of the two East India Shipps which I had a hand in
contriving for the King’s service, and may do myself
a good office
too thereby. I to dinner with Mr. Waight to his father-in-law’s in
Greenwich — one of the most silly, harmless, prating old men that
ever I heard in my life. Thence to the office; and after some letters,
down to Woolwich, where I have not lain with my wife these eight
daysI think, or more.' After supper, and telling her my mind about
my trouble in what I have done as to buying of these goods — we to
bed.
