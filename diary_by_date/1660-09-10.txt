office day. news brought us of the Dukes intention to go
tomorrow to the fleet for a day or two to meet his sister. Coll.
Slingsby and I to Whitehall, thinking to proffer our service to the
Duke to wait upon him; but meeting with Sir G. Carteret, he sent
us in all haste back again to hire two Catches for the present use of
the Duke. So we returned and landed at the Beare at the bridge-
foot, where we saw Suthwark faire (I having not at all seen
Bartlmew fayre); and so to the towre wharfe, where we did hire
two Catches. So to the office and found Sir W. Batten at dinner
with some friends upon a good Chine of beef, on which I eat
heartily, I being very hungry.
