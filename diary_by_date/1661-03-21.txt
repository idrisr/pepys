Up very earely and to work and study in my chamber. And
then to Whitehall to my Lord, and there did stay with him a good
while discoursing upon his accounts. Here I stayed with Mr. Creed
all the morning. And at noon dined with my Lord, who was very
merry; and after dinner we sang and fiddled a great while. Then Iby
water (Mr. sheply, pinkny, and others going part of the way) home
and there hard at work setting my papers in order and writing
letters till night. And so to bed.
