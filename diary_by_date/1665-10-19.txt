My business of the victualling goes on as I would have it; and
now my head is full how to make some profit of it to myself or
people. To that end, when I came home, I wrote a letter to Mr.
Coventry, offering myself to be the Surveyor-Generall, and am apt
to think he will assist me in it; but I do not set my heart much on it,
though it would be a good help. So back to my office, and there till
past one before I could get all these letters and papers copied out,
which vexed me. But so sent them away without hopes of saving
the post, and so to my lodging to bed.
