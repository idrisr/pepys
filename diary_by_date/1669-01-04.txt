Lay long talking with my wife, and did of my own accord
come to an allowance of her of 30/ a year for all expenses, clothes
and everything; which she was mightily pleased with, it being more
then ever she asked or expected; and so rose with much content, and
up and with W. Hewer to Whitehall, there to speak with Mr. Wren;
which I did, about several things of the office entered in my
memorandum-books; and.so about noon, going homeward with
W. Hewer, he and I went in and saw the great tall woman that is to
be seen, which is but twenty-one years old and I do easily stand
under her arms.
