Mr. Grey did assure me this night that he was told this day by
one of the greater Ministers of State in England and one of the
King’s Cabinet, that we had little left to agree on between the Duch
and us towards a peace, but only the place of Treaty — which doth
astonish me to hear, but am gladofit, for I fear the consequence of
the war. But he says that the King having all the money he is like to
have, we shall be sure of
a peace ina
little time.
