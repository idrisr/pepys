Up, and at the office sat all the morning — where among other
things, I did the first unkind [thing] that ever I did design to Sir W.
Warren. But I did it now to some purpose, to make him sensible
how little any friendship shall avail him ifhe wants mine. I perceive
he doth nowadays court much my Lord Brouncker’s favour, who
never did any man much courtesy at the Board, nor ever will be able
— at least, so much as myself. Besides, my Lord would do him a
kindness in concurrence with me; but he would have the danger of
the thing to be done lie upon me, if there be any danger in it (in
drawing upa
letter to Sir W. Warren’s advantage); which I do not
like, nor will endure. I was, I confess, very angry, and will venture
the loss of Sir W. Warren’s kindnesses rather then he shall have any
man’s friendship in greater esteem then mine.
