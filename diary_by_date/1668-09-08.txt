Upand by water to Whitehall and to St. James’s, there to talk a
little with Mr. Wren about the private business we are upon in the
office, where he tells me he finds that they all suspect me to be the
author of the great letter; which Ivalue not — being satisfied that it is
the best thing I could ever do for myself. And so after some
discourse of this kind more, I back to the office, where all the
morning; and after dinner, to it again all the afternoon and very late;
and then home to supper, where met W. Batelier and B. Turner;
and after some talk with them, and supper, we to bed. This day, I
received so earnest an invitation again from Roger Pepys to come to
Sturbridge Fair, that I resolve to let my wife go, which she shall do
the next week; and so to bed. This day I received two letters from
the Duke of Richmond about his Yacht, which is newly taken into
the King’s service, and I am gladofit, hoping hereby to oblige him
and to have occasions of seeing his noble Duchess, which I adore.
