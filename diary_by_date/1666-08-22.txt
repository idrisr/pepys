Upand by coach with rool to the Exchequer to pay fees there.
There leftit, and I to St. James’s and there with the Duke of York. I
had opportunity of much talk with Sir W. Penn today (he being
newly come from the fleet); and he doth much undervalue the
honour that is given to the conduct of the late business of Holmes in
burning the ships and town, saying it was a great thing endeed, and
of great profit to us, in beingofgreat loss to the enemy; but that it
was wholly a business of chance, and no conduct imployed in it. I
find Sir W. Penn doth hold up his head at this time higher then ever
he did in his life. I perceive he doth look after Sir
J.Mennes’s place if
he dies; and though Ilove him not, nor do desire to have him in, yet
Ido think him the ablest man in England for it. To the Chequer, and
there received my tallies and paid my fees in good order. And so
home, and there find Mrs. Knipp and my wife going to dinner. She
tells me my song of Beauty Retire is mightily cried up — which I am
nota little proud of; and do think Ihave done It is Decreed better, but
Ihave not finished it. My Closet is doing by Upholsters, which lam
pleased with, but fear my purple will be too sad for that melancholy
room. After dinner and doing something at the office, I with my
wife, Knepp, and Mercer by coach to Moorefields and there saw
Polichinelle, which pleases me mightily; and here I saw our Mary,
our last chambermaid, who is gone from Mrs. Pierce’s it seems.
Then carried Knipp home, calling at the Cocke alehouse at the door
and drank. And so home and there find Reeves; and so up to look
upon the Starrs, and do like my glass very well and did even with
him for it, and a little perspective and the Lanthorne that shows
tricks — all together costing me 9/ 5s. So to bed, he lying at our
house.
