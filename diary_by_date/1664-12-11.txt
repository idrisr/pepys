Lords day. Up and to church alone in the morning. Dined at
home mighty pleasantly; in the afternoon I to the French church —
where much pleased with the three sisters of the parson, very
handsome; especially in their noses —and sing prettily. [hear a good
sermon of the old man, touching duty to parents. Here was Sir
Samll. Morland and his Lady, very fine, with two footmen in new
liverys — the church taking much notice of them — and going into
their coach after sermon with great gazeing. So I home, and my
Cousin Mary Pepys’s husband came after me and told me that out
of the money he received some months since,‘ he did receive 18d.
too much, and did now come and give it me, which was very
pretty. So home, and there found Mr. Andrews and his lady, a
well-bred and a tolerable pretty woman, and by and by Mr. Hill;
and to singing and then to supper. Then to sing again, and so good-
night. To prayers and to bed. It is a little strange how these psalms
of Ravenscroft, after two or three times singing, prove but the same
again, though good — no diversity appearing at all almost.
