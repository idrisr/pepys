After dinner my wife and I, by Mr. Rawlinsons conduct, to
the Jewish Synagogue — where the men and boys in their Vayles,
and the women behindalettice out of sight; and some things stand
up, whichI believe is their Law, ina press, to which all coming in
do bow; and at the putting on their veils do say something, to which
others that hear him do cry Amen, and the party doth kiss his veil.
Their service all in a singing way, and in Hebrew. And anon their
Laws, that they take out of the press, is carried by several men, four
or five, several burthens in all, and they do relieve one another, or
whether it is that everyone desires to have the carrying of it, I
cannot tell. Thus they carried [it] round, round about the room
while such a service is singing. And in the end they had a prayer for
the King, which they pronounced his name in Portugall; but the
prayer, like the rest, in Hebrew. But Lord, to see the disorder,
laughing, sporting, and no attention, but confusion in all their
service, more like Brutes then people knowing the true God, would
make a man forswear ever seeing them more; and endeed, I never
did see so much, or could have imagined there had been any religion
in the whole world so absurdly performed as this.
