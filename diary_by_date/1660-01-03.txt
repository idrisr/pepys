Mr. Sheply, Hawly and Moore dined with me on a piece of
beef and cabbage, and a collar of brawn. We then fell to cards till
dark, and then I went home with Mrs. Jem. Thence back to
Whitehall, where I understood that the Parliament have passed the
1. Edward Mountagu, his Po
2. Jemima, wife of Edward Mountagu.
2
Act for Indemnity to the soldiers and officers that would come in in
so many days, and that my Lord Lambert should have benefit of the
said Act. They have also voted that all vacancy in the House by the
death of any of the old members shall be filled up; but those that are
living shall not be called in. Thence I went home; and there found
Mr. Hunt and his wife and Mr. Hawly, who sat with me till 10 at
night at cards, and so broke up. And to bed.
