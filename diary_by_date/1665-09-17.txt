Lords day. Up, and before Iwent out of my chamber, did draw
a Musique Scale, in order to my having it at any time ready in my
hand to turn to for exercise, for I have a great mind in this vacation
to perfect myself in my Scale, in order to my practising of
composition. And so that being done, I downstairs and there find
Capt. Cocke under the barber’s hands — the barber that did
heretofore trim Comissioner Pett, and with whom I have been. He
offered to come this day after dinner with his violin, to play mea set
of Lyra ayres upon it, which I was glad of, hoping to be merry
thereby. Being ready, we to church, where a company of fine
people to church, anda fine church and very good sermon (Mr.
Plume being a very excellent scholler and preacher); coming out of
the church, I met Mrs. Pierce, whom I was shamed to see, having
not been with her since my coming to town — but promised to visit
§28
her. Thence with Capt. Cocke (in his coach) home to dinner,
whither comes by invitation My Lord Bruncker and his mistress,
and very good company we were. But in dinner-time comesSirJo.
Minnes from the fleet like a simple weak man, having nothing to
say of what he hath done there, but tells us of what value he
imagines the prizes to be, and that my Lord Sandwich is well and
mightily concerned to hear that I was well. But this did put me
upon a desire of going thither; and moving of it to my Lord, we
presently agreed upon it to go this very Tide, we two and Capt.
Cocke. So everybody prepared to fit himself for his Journy, and I
walked to Woolwich to trim and shift myself; and by the time I was
ready they came down in the Bezan Yacht, and so I aboard and my
boy Tom. And there very merrily we sailed to below Gravesend,
and there came to Anchor for all night and supped and talked, and
with much pleasure at last settled ourselfs to sleep — having very
good lodging upon Cushions in the Cabbin.
