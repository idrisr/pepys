talked about our business and what to do therein. So after I had
talked and advised with my uncle by his bedside, we all horsed

at the Beare with my brother, went to Mr. Sedgewicke the steward
of Gravely. And there talked with him, but could get little hopes
from anything that he would tell us; but at last I did give himafee,

wife went down and rode through Sturbrige fayre; but the fair was

Cambrige and there at the beare had some herings, we and my
brother; and after dinner set out for Brampton, where we come in
very good time and find all things well; and being somewhat
weary, after some talk about tomorrow’s business with my father,
we went to bed.
