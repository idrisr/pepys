Up by 4 a-clock and so to my office. But before I went out,
calling, as Ihaveoflate done, for my boy’s Copybook, Ifind that he
hath not done his taske,and so I beat him and then went up to fetch
my ropes end; but before I got down the boy was gone; I searched
the cellar with a Candle,and from top to bottom could not find him
high nor low. So to the office; and after an hour or two, by water to
the Temple to my Cosen Roger, who I perceive is a deadly high
man in the parliament business, and against the Court — showing
me how they have computed that the King hath spent, at least hath
received, about four Millions of money since he came in. So home
to dinner alone; and there I find that my boy had got out of doors,
and came in for his hat and band and so is gone away to his brother.
But I do resolve even to let him go for good and all.
