Up about 5 a-clock and dressed ourselfs; and to sail again
down to the Soveraigne at the buoy of the Noure—a noble ship, now
rigged and fitted and manned. We did not stay long, but to enquire
after her readiness; and thence to Sheerenesse, where we walked up
and down, laying out the ground to be taken in for a yard to lay
provisions for cleaning and repairing of ships; and a most proper
place it is for that purpose. Thence with great pleasure up the
Meadeway, our yacht contending with Comissioner Pett’s, where-
in he met us from Chatham; and he had the best of it. Here I came
by, but had not tide enough to stop at Quinbrough. With mighty
pleasure spent the day in doing all and seeing these places, which I

dined; and after dinner spent some time discoursing of business —

where great is the plague, and Itroubled to stay there so long for the
tide. At ro at night, having supped, Itook boat alone, and slept well
all the way to the Tower docke, about 3 a-clock in the morning. So
knocked up my people and to bed.
