Up very early and got a-top of my house, seeing the design of
my work; and like it very well, and it comes into my head to have
my dining-[room] wainscoated, which will be very pretty. By and
by, by water to Deptford to put several things in order, being
myself now only left in town; and so back again to the office and
there doing business all the morning and the afternoon also, till
night, and then came Cooper for my Mathematiques; but in good
earnest, my head is so full of business that I cannot understand it as
otherwise I should do. At night to bed, being much troubled at the
rain coming into my house, the top being open.
