[Up] very betimes, and so continued all the morning, with W.
Hewer, upon examining and stating my accounts, in order to the
fitting myself to go abroad beyond sea, which the ill condition of
my eyes, and my neglect for a year or two, hath kept me
behindhand in, and so as to render it very difficult now, and
troublesome to my mind to do it; but I this day madeasatisfactory
entrance therein. Dined at home, and in the afternoon by water to
Whitehall, calling by the way at Michell’s, where I have not been
many a
day till just the other day; and now I met her mother there
and knew her husband to be out of town. And here yo did besar ella,
but have not opportunity para hazer mas with her as I would have
offered if yo had had it. And thence had another meeting with the
Duke of York at Whitehall with the Duke of York on yesterday's
work, and made a good advance; and so being called by my wife,
we to the park, Mary Batelier, a Duch gentleman, a friend of hers,
being with us. Thence to the World’s end, a drinking-house by the
park, and there merry; and so home late.
And thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my
own eyes in the keeping of my journall, Ibeing not able to do it any
longer, having done now so long as to undo my eyes almost every
time that I take a pen in my hand; and therefore, whatever comes of
it, I must forbear; and therefore resolve from this time forward to
have it kept by my people in longhand, and must therefore be
contented to set down no more then is fit for them and all the world
- to know; or if there be anything (which cannot be much, now my
amours to Deb are past, and my eyes hindering me in almost all
other pleasures), I must endeavour to keep a margin in my book
open, to add here and there a note in shorthand with my own hand.
And soI betake myself that course which [is] almost as much as to
see myself go into my grave — for which, and all the discomforts
that will accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me.

“POSTSCRIPT
#-
Pepys never kept another diary comparable in scale and character
with this, although his eyes quickly recovered from the worst
effects of the strain which had led him to end it. He later
composed other journals, which were for the most part not
personal diaries but memoranda arranged
in diary form and
written out by clerks. But in July 1683 when he was sent to
Tangier as secretary of the Commission which supervised the
evacuation of the colony, the occasion called for a descriptive
diary. He wrote it in shorthand and it covers the voyage there and
back, his time in Tangier, and a trip he took in mid-winter to
S.W. Spain. It has passages that are reminiscent of his diary
keeping at its best. But it suffers from its shortness and from the
limitations of its purpose: he does not attempt in its pages to lay
bare his life. What readers of Pepys must regret is that he did not
resume his great diary in the 1670s and ’80s. His version of those
critical years, which included the Popish Plot and Glorious
Revolution of 1688 (in both of which he was closely involved),
told in diary form and in Pepysian detail by one who knew James u1
so well, would have been an historical source of incomparable
value. It must rank as one of the most interesting books never
written.

-“PURTHER READING!%-
Of the commentaries on the diary the most comprehensive is vol.
X of the complete edition edited by myself and Professor William
Matthews — the Companion, 1983 — which has essays by various
authors on persons, places and subjects. The most succinct is a
work written for the general reader by J. R. Tanner, a pioneer
scholar to whom all students of Pepys are indebted, Mr Pepys
(1925), which summarises the subject matter of the diary in
chapters entitled ‘Books’, ‘The Household’ and so on, and has
excellent short accounts of his life before and after the diary
period. C. S. Emden’s Pepys Himself (Oxford, 1963) and Percival
Hunt’s Pepys in the Diary (Pittsburgh, 1959) are also useful. The
latter succeeds in preserving something of the charm of the
original. H. B. Wheatley’s Samuel Pepys and World he Lived in
(1880) and the concluding volume of his edition of the diary
(Pepysiana, 1899), like W. H. Whitear, More Pepysiana (1927), have
information mostly of an antiquarian sort. So have the two
volumes of Occasional Papers ... of the Samuel Pepys Club (priv.
prtd, 1917, 1925). Special aspects are dealt with in H. C. Levis,
Extracts from the Diaries and Correspondence of John Evelyn and
Samuel Pepys relating to Engraving (1915); Helen McAfee, Pepys on
the Restoration Stage (New Haven, 1916); A. G. Matthews, Mr
Pepys and Nonconformity (1954);
J.H. Wilson, The Private Life ofMr
Pepys (1960) and M. H. Nicolson, Pepys’ Diary and the New Science
(Charlottesville; 1965). The diary’s evidence necessarily plays a
‘large part in W. G. Bell’s The Great Fire (1923) and the same
author’s The Great Plague (rev. ed., 1951). Pepys’s shorthand may
be studied in the modern reprint of the manual from which he
learned the system — Thomas Shelton’s A Tutor to Tachygraphy, or
Short-writing (for a modern reprint, see above, p. Xiv, n. 2).

Further Reading
Apart from the diary and his letters the most important of Pepys’s
writings which have been printed are three: his Tangier diary, in
The Tangier Papers of Samuel Pepys, transcribed, edited and
collated with the transcription by William Matthews by Edwin
Chappell (Navy Records Society, 1935): his Memoires relating to the
Royal Navy (1690, cf. pp. xxx—xxxi above) reprinted at Oxford in
1906 in the Tudor and Stuart Library and edited by J. R. Tanner;
and his Naval Minutes (ed. Tanner, Navy Records Society, 1926),
a commonplace book of notes he kept in the 1680s and ’gos,
mostly reflecting on the nation’s neglect of its navy. Six of the
pamphlets he wrote in 1698-9 in his attempt to reform Christ’s
Hospital have been reproduced in fascimile (Rudolf Kirk, ed., Mr
Pepys upon the State of Christ-Hospital, Philadelphia, 1939). His
transcription of Charles m’s oral account of his escape after the
Battle of Worcester has been edited by William Matthews (Charles
’s Escape from Worcester, 1966).
A substantial number of Pepys’s letters are available in print. He
preserved much of his official and private correspondence in four
letter-books inherited by his nephew Jackson, who himself added
some that were among his own papers. A small selection from the
letter-books was printed in the nineteenth-century editions of the
diary by Braybrooke and by Bright. The letter-books have now
been published much more fully by J. R. Tanner in Private
Correspondence and Miscellaneous Papers of Samuel Pepys, 1679-1703
(2 vols, 1926) and Further Correspondence of Samuel Pepys 1662-79
(1929). A few of the miscellaneous papers and all the shorthand
letters were omitted by Tanner. The latter were printed by Edwin.
Chappell in Shorthand Letters of Samuel Pepys (Cambridge, 1933).
Other letters survive in manuscript, principally in the Rawlinson
collection in the Bodleian Library. A handful of these were printed
by Braybrooke and by Bright in their editions of the diary; a larger
selection (together with a selection from the Tanner volumes) was
published and edited by R. G. Howarth in his Letters and the Second
Diary of Samuel Pepys (1933). (The second diary is the Tangier
diary which Howarth printed from John Smith’s defective text of
1841.) Two other selections have appeared — H. T. Heath’s edition
of The Letters ofSamuel Pepys and his Family Circle (Oxford, 1955,
repr. Westport, Conn., 1979) and some of his correspondence
1026
Further Reading
with Evelyn in C. Marburg, Mr Pepys and Mr Evelyn (Philadel-
phia, 1935).
Of biographies of Pepys, that by Sir Arthur Bryant is the fullest,
though it goes no further than 1689 (3 vols, 1933-8 and later
issues, Cambridge and London: Samuel Pepys, vol. 1, The Man in
the Making; vol. Il, The Years ofPeril; vol. Il, The Saviour of the
Navy). Its strong points derive from the author’s gift for vivid
narrative. Richard Ollard’s Pepys, a Biography (1974; also in
paperback 1978 and, Oxford, 1984), elegantly written, is far and
away the best single-volume life and is superior to Bryant as a
character study. Edwin Chappell’s Eight Generations of the Pepys
Family, 1500-1800 (1926) presents the genealogical information in
an ingenious and accessible form. Pepys’s patron Sandwich is well
served by the sound and ample biography by F. R. Harris (2 vols,
1912).
The political background is best studied in David Ogg, England in
the Reign of Charles 1 (vol. I, 2nd ed., Oxford, 1955);
J. R. Jones,
Country and Court, 1658-1714 (1981), and John Miller, James II, a
Study in Kingship (Hove, 1977). Debate on the character and
political behaviour of Charles 1 continues; the latest defence is by
Antonia Fraser (King Charles 11, 1979) and the latest attack by
Richard Ollard (The Image of the King: Charles 1 and Charles u,
1979). J. R. Tanner’s Samuel Pepys and the Royal Navy (Cam-
bridge, 1920), covers Pepys’s career as an administrator. It is
admirably supplemented by N. A. M. Rodger, The Admiralty
(Lavenham, 1979); J. P. W. Ehrman, The Navy in the Wars of
William 111 (Cambridge, 1958), which casts a great dealoflight on
the Pepys period, and Michael Lewis, England’s Sea-Officers
(1939). For the Second Dutch War, see A. W. Tedder, The Navy of
_the Restoration (Cambridge, 1916); C. H. Wilson, Profit and Power:
A study of England and the Dutch Wars (1957); Richard Ollard, Man
of War: Sir Robert Holmes and the Restoration Navy (1969) and P. G.
Rogers, The Dutch in the Medway (1970). The ships of the line are
described, with illustrations, in F. Fox, Great Ships: The Battle-fleet
ofCharles 11 (1980). There are three diaries that give vivid pictures
oflife at sea: by a seaman, Edward Barlow (Barlow’s Journals, ed.
B. Lubbock, 2 vols, 1934); a naval surgeon, James Yonge (Journal,
1027
Further Reading
ed. F. N. L. Poynter, 1963), and a naval chaplain, Henry Teonge
(Diary, 1675-1679, ed. G. E. Manwaring, The Broadway Travel-
lers, 1927). The Tangier episode is dealt with in E. M. G. Routh,
Tangier, an Outpost ofEmpire, 1661-84 (1912).
A list of diaries roughly contemporary with that of Pepys
(embellished with a sprightly introduction) is to be found in
William Matthews’s standard bibliography: British Diaries [1442-
1942] (Univ. Cal. Press and Cambridge, 1950). They are, princi-
pally, those of John Evelyn (the definitive edition is by E. S. De
Beer, Oxford, 6 vols, 1955; he also published it in slightly reduced
form in one volume in the Oxford Standard Authors series in
1959); Robert Hooke (ed. H. W. Robinson and W. Adams, 1935);
Ralph Josselin (the definitive edition is by A. Macfarlane, 1976,
who has written an interesting commentary, from the point of
view of
a social anthropologist, in The Family Life ofRalph Josselin,
Cambridge, 1970); Roger Lowe (ed. W. L. Sachse, 1938); John
Locke (Locke’s Travels in France 1675-1679, ed. J. Lough, Cam-
bridge, 1953); Anthony 4 Wood (Life and Times, 5 vols, ed. A.
Clark, Oxford Historical Society, 1891-1900) and Celia Fiennes
(Journeys, ed. C. Morris, 1947; illust. ed. 1982). Of slighter
interest are those of Thomas Rugge, annalist of events in London
(Diurnal, ed. W. L. Sachse, Camden Society, 1961), and Elias
Ashmole the astrologer (ed. R. T. Gunther, Old Ashmolean
Reprints, 1927). There are summaries of many sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century diaries, and some observations on diary
keeping in general, in A. Ponsonby, English Diaries (1923) and
More English Diaries (1927).

~&GLOSSARY*®-
This list consists of words and phrases, mostly obsolete, which the
reader may find it difficult to understand. It does not include obsolete
forms whose meaning is sufficiently clear without explanation — e.g.
jangle (quarrel) or bedaggled (bedraggled). Where a word is used by
Pepys in several senses the different meanings are separated by semi-
colons. No note is made of the modern meaning where a word is used in
both obsolete and modern senses, nor are all the spellings recorded. Old
forms of place names — Gracious (Gracechurch) Street, Cales (Cadiz) etc.
— are to be found not here but in the Index. A few foreign words and
phrases are included, but there is no attempt to translate titles of books
and songs, or Pepys’s macaronic language.
The definitions in many cases owe much to those given by Dr Richard
Luckett in the Large Glossary which he compiled for the Companion
volume of the full edition of the diary.

—“INDEX?-
—“INDEX#-
The index is intended both as a guide to the text (though
necessarily selective) and as a means of conveying information
which might otherwise have been given in footnotes. Its general
design and many of its conventions are based on the index to the
complete edition. Pepys himself is understood to be the subject of
the whole diary. A small number of references have been gathered
under his hame, covering events before the diary period. Other
references to him are distributed throughout the index, signalled
by the initial P; Elizabeth Pepys (EP) is similarly treated, the
references under her name being restricted to principal events and
activities. London is the almost permanent venue of the events
described, and references under that heading are confined to civic
affairs. Otherwise persons and places are given in the commonest of
forms used in the text here printed (with modern or received
forms given in square brackets) save where it is convenient or
logical to give the modern forms followed by any textual variant
enclosed in round brackets. Peers and holders of courtesy titles
appear under their titles; titles and offices held are limited to the
diary era, except in a few cases of well-known persons best
remembered by titles or offices held after 1669 (which information
is added in square brackets). Bishops are to be found under the
names of their sees unless at some point Pepys mentions them by
surname. Books, plays and musical compositions are indexed under
the names of their authors and composers where these are given
by Pepys or if more than one work is mentioned; otherwise by
title as printed in italic in the text (representing longhand in the
MS.); or else under the subject matter if Pepys offers neither
author/composer nor title.
It remains for me to thank the Editor and his wife for their help
at many points in my work.

Robert Latham is a Fellow of Magdalene
College, Cambridge, where, as Pepys Lib-
rarian until 1982, he had charge of the
remarkable collection of books, prints and
manuscripts — including the manuscript of the
Diary itself — which Pepys left to his old
college. He has devoted the greater part of
the past thirty years to the study of the diary
and, in addition to his work on the eleven
volume edition, is the editor of The Illustrated
Pepys.
From Reviews ofThe Diary ofSamuel Pepys
“One of the most important literary achieve-
ments of the century.” Stewart McBride,
Christian Science Monitor.
‘Seldom has such - learning been so
economically and so elegantly presented.”
Hugh Trevor-Roper, Listener.
“One of the finest feats in all the long history
of scholarship.”’ Bernard Levin, The Observer.
“A triumph of modern scholarship.”
C.P. Snow, Financial Times.
“Perhaps the most honest, incredibly reveal-
ing personal chronicle ever written.”
Chicago Daily News.
“A monumental scholarly effort.’ Robert
Taylor, Boston Globe.
“Pepys’s diary is the cheerful self-report,
not of the man eminent in naval history,
nor of the historical witness, but of the unob-
jectionable hedonist.”” Geoffrey Grigson,
The Guardian.
“One of the most widely and justly applauded
scholarly enterprises of our times.’ Richard
Ollard, Financial Times.
