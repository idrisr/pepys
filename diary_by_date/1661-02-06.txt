Called up by my Cosen Snow, who sat by me while I was
trimmed, and then I drank with him —he desiring a courtesy for a
friend, which I have done for him. Then to the office and there sat
long; then to dinner — Capt. Murford with me. I had a dish of fish
and a good Hare, which was sent me the other day by Goodenough
the plaisterer. So to the office again, where Sir W. Pen andIsat all
alone answering of peticions and nothing else. And so to Sir W.
Batten’s, where comes Mr. Jessop (one whom I could not formerly
have looked upon; and now he comes cap in hand to us from the
Commissioners of the Navy, though endeed he is a man of a great
estate and of good report) about some business from them to us,
which we answered by letter. Here I sat long with Sir W., who is
not well. And then home and to my chamber and some little
Musique; and so to bed.
