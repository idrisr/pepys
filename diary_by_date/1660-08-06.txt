This morning at the office; and that being done, home to dinner
all alone, my wife being ill in pain a-bed — which I was troubled at,
and notalittle impatient. After dinner to Whitehall at the Privy
Seale all the afternoon; and at night with Mr. Man to Mr.
Rawlinson’s in Fanchurch street, where we stayed till 11 a-clock at
night; so home and to bed — my wife being all this day in great pain.
This night Mr. Man offered me 1000! for my office of Clerk of the
Acts, which made my mouth water; but yet I dare not take it till I
speak with my Lord to have his consent.
