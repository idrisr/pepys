Upand my office, there conning my measuring-Ruler, which
I shall grow a master of in a very little time. At noon to the
Exchange, and so home to dinner and abroad with my wife by
water to the Royall Theatre and there saw The Comittee, a merry but
an indifferent play; only Lacy’s part, an Irish footman, is beyond
imagination. Here I saw my Lord Falconbrige and his Lady, my
Lady Mary Cromwell, who looks as well as Ihave known her and
well-clad; but when the House begun to fill, she put on her vizard
and so kept it on all the play — which is of late become a great fashion
among the ladies, which hides their whole face.
