Up, and my wife and Iby coach to Bennetts in Paternoster row
(few shops there being yet open), and there bought velvett for a coat
and Camelott for a cloak for myself. And thence to a place to look
over some fine counterfeit damasks to hang my wife’s closet, and
pitched upon one. And so by coach home again, I calling at the
Change; and so home to dinner, and all the afternoon look after my
papers at home and my office against tomorrow; and so after
supper, and considering the uselessness of laying out so much
money upon my wife’s closet, but only the chamber — to bed.
