Up and to Deptford by water, reading Othello, Moore of
Venice, which I ever heretofore esteemed a mighty good play; but
having so lately read The Adventures offive hours, it seems a mean
thing. Walked back,and so home and then down to the old Swan
and drank at B. Michells; and so to Westminster to the Exchequer
about my quarter’s tallies; and so to Lumberdstreete to choose stuff
to hang my new intended closet, and have chosen purple. So home
to dinner, and all the afternoon, till almost midnight, upon my
Tanger accounts, getting Tom Willson to help me in writing as I
read, and at night W. Hewers; and find myself most happy in the
keeping of all my accounts, for that after all the changings and
turnings necessary in such an account, I find myself right to a
farding, in an account of 127000l. This afternoon I visited Sir J.
Mennes, who, poor man, is much impaired by these few days
sickness; and I fear endeed it will kill him.
