Strange, with what freedom and quantity I pissed this night,
which I know not what to impute to but my oysters — unless the
coldness of the night should cause it, for it was a sad rainy and
tempestuous night. As soon as up, I begun to have some pain in my
blather and belly as usual, which made me go to dinner betimes to
fill my belly; and that did ease me, so as I did my business in the
afternoon, in forwarding the settling of my house, very well.

Betimes to bed, my wife also being all this day ill in the same
manner. Troubled at my wife’s hair coming offso much. This day
the Parliament met, and adjourned till Friday, when the King will
be with them.
