1668-11-22

Lords day. My wife andI lay long, with mighty content, and
so rose, and she spent the whole day making herself clean, after four
or five weeks being in continued dirt. And I knocking up nails and
making little settlements in my house, till noon; and then eat a bit of
meat in the kitchen, I all alone, and so to the office to set down my
966
Journall, for some days leaving it imperfect, the matter being
mighty grievous to me and my mind from the nature of it. And so
in to solace myself with my wife, whom I got to read to me, and so
W. Hewer and the boy; and so after supper, to bed. This day, my
boy’s Livery is come home, the first I ever had of Greene lined with
red; and it likes me well enough.
