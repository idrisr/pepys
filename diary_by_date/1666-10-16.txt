Up, and to the office, where sat to do little business but hear
clamours for money. At noon home to dinner, and to the office
again, after hearing my brother playalittle upon the Lyra viall,
which he doth so as to show that he hath a love to Musique and a
spirit for it— which I am well pleased with. I all the afternoon at the
office, and at night with Sir W. Batten, W. Penn, J. Mennes at W.
Penn’s lodgings, advising about business and orders fit presently to
make about discharging of ships come into the river, and which to
pay first, and many things in order thereto. But it vexed me, that it
being now past 7 a-clock, and the businesses of great weight and I
had done them by 8 a-clock, and sending them to be signed, they
were all gone to bed, and Sir W. Penn, though awake, would not,
being in bed, have them brought him to sign. This made me quite
angry. Late at work at the office, and then home to supper and to
bed.
