About 3 a-clock this morning I waked with the noise of the
rayne, having never in my life heard a more violent shower. And
then the Catt was locked in the chamber and keeped a great
mewing, and leapt upon the bed, which made me] could not sleep a
great while. Then to sleep, and about 5 a-clock rose and up to my
office. And about 8 a-clock went down to Deptford and there with
Mr. Davis did look over most of his stores; by the same token, in
the great storehouse, while Capt. Badily was talking to us, one
from a trap-doore above let fall unawares a coyle of cable, that it
was 10000 to one it had not broke Capt. Bodily’s neck, it came so
near him — but did him no hurt. I went on with looking and
informing myself of the Stores, with great delight; and having done
there, I took boat home again and dined. And after dinner sent for
some of my workmen and did scold at them, so as I hope my work
will be hastened.
