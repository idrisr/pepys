After with great pleasure lying a great while, talking and
sporting in bed with my wife (for we have [been] for some years
now, and at present more and more, a very happy couple, blessed
be God), I got up and to my office; and having done there some
business, and by water and then walked to Deptford to discourse
with Mr. Cowly and Davis about my late conceptions about
keeping books of the distinct works done in the yards, against
whichI find no objection but their ignorance and unwillingness to
do anything of pains and what is out of their old dull road. But Ilike
it well, and will proceed in it. So home and dined there with my
wife upon a most excellent dish of tripes of my own directing,
covered with mustard, as I have heretofore seen them done at my
Lord Crews; of which I made a
very great meal and sent for a glass
of wine for myself. This noon came to see me and sit with mea little
after dinner, Mr. Pierce the Chyrurgeon — who tells me how ill
things go at Court; that the King doth show no countenance to any
[that] belong to the Queene, nor above all to such english as she
brought over with her or hath here since, for fear they should tell
her how he carries himself to Mrs. Palmer.
