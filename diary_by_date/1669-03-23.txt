Up and to my office to doa little business there; and so my
things being all ready, Itook coach with Commissioner Middleton,
Capt. Tinker and Mr. Huchinson, a hackney coach, and over the
bridge, and so out towards Chatham; and dined at Dartford, where
we stayed an hour or two, it being a cold day; and so on and got to
Chatham just at night, with very good discourse by the way; but
mostly of matters or religion, wherein Huchinson his vein lies.
After supper we fell to talk of spirits and apparitions, whereupon
many pretty perticular stories were told, so as to make me almost
1000
afeared to lie alone, but for shame I could not help it; and so to bed,
and being sleepy, fell soon to rest and so rested well.
