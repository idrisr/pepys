This morning comes to me the coachmaker, and agreed with
me for 53/, and stand to the courtesy for what more I should give
him upon the finishing of it. He is likely also to fit me with a
949
coachman. There comes also to me Mr. Shotgrave, the Operator of
our Royal Society, to show me his method of making the Tubes for
Eyes, which are clouterly done, so that mine are better; but I have
well informed myself in several things from him and so am glad of
speaking with him.
