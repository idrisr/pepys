Memorandum. \ had taken my Journall during the fire and the
disorders fallowing in loose papers until this very day, and could
not get time to enter them in my book till January 18 in the
morning, having made my eyes sore by frequent attempts this
winter to do it. But now it is done, for which I thank God, and pray
never the like occasion may happen.
