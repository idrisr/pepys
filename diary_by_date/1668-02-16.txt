Lords day. Up and to my chamber, where all the morning
making a Catalogue of my books; which did find me work, but
with great pleasure, my chamber and books being now set in very
good order and my chamber washed and cleaned, which it had not
been in some months before — my business and trouble having been
so much. At noon Mr. Hollier put in and dined with my wife and
me, who was alittle better today. His company very good; his story
of his love and fortune, which hath been very good and very bad in
the world, well worth hearing. Much discourse also about the bad
state of the church, and how the clergy are come to be men of no
worth in the world — and, as the world doth now generally
discourse, they must be reformed; and I believe the Hierarchy will
ina
little time be shaken, whether they will or no — the King being
offended with them and set upon it as I hear. He gone, after dinner
to have my head combed; and then to my chamber and read most of
the evening till pretty late, when, my wife not being well, I did lie
below stairs in our great chamber, where I slept well.
