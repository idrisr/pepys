Easter day. | up and walked to the Temple; and there got a
coach to Whitehall, where spoke with several people, and find
by all that Pen is to go to sea this year with this fleet. And they
excuse the Prince’s going by saying that it is not a command great
enough for him. Here I met with Brisban; and after hearing the
service at the King’s chapel, where I heard the Bishop of Norwich,
Dr. Reynolds the old presbyterian, begin a very plain sermon, he
and I to the Queen’s chapel and there did hear the Italians sing; and
endeed, their music did appear most admirable to me, beyond
anything of ours—I was never so well satisfied in my life with it. So
back to Whitehall, and there met Mr. Pierce and adjousted together
how we should spend tomorrow together. And so by coach, |
home to dinner, where Kate Joyce was, as I invited her; and had a
good dinner, only she and us; and after dinner, she and I alone to
talk about her business as Idesigned; andI find her very discreet, and
assures me she neither doth nor will incline to the doing anything
towards marriage without my advice, and did tell me that she had
many offers, and that Harman and his friends would fain have her
but he is poor and hath poor friends, and so it will not be advisable.
But that there is another, a Tobacconist, one Holinshed, whom she
speaks well of to bea plain, sober man and in good condition, that
offers her very well; and submits to me my examining and
inquiring after it —if I see good — which I do like of it, for it will be
best for her to marry I think as soon as she can; at least, to be rid of
this house — for the trade will not agree with a young widow that is
891
a little handsome; at least, ordinary people think her so. Being well
satisfied with her answer, she anon went away; andI to my closet to
make a few more experiments of my notions in Musique; and so
then my wife and I to walk in the garden, and then home to supper
and to bed.
