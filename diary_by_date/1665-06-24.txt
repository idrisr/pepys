Midsummer Day. Up very betimes, by 6, and at Dr. Clerkes at
Westminster by 7 of the clock, having overnight by a note
acquainted him with my intention of coming. And there I, in the
best manner Icould, broke my errand about a match between Sir G.
Carterts eldest son and my Lord Sandwiches eldest daughter —
which he (as Iknew he would) took with great content; and we both
agreed that my Lord and he, being both men relating to the sea -
under a kind aspect of His Majesty — already good friends, and both
virtuous and good families, their allyance might be of good use to
us. And he did undertake to find out Sir George this morning, and
put the business in execution. So being both well pleased with the
proposition, I saw his neece there and made her sing me two or
three songs, very prettily; and so home to the office — where to my
great trouble, I found Mr. Coventry and the board met before I
came. I excused my late coming, by having been upon the River
about office business. So to business all the morning. [After dinner]
to Dr. Clerke, and there find that he hath broke the business to Sir
G. Carteret and that he takes the thing mighty well. Thence I to Sir
G. Carteret at his Chamber, and in the best manner I could, and
most obligingly, moved that business; he received it with great
respect and content and thanks to me, and promised that he would
do what he could possibly for his son, to render him fit for my
Lord’s daughter. And showed great kindness to me, and sense of
my kindness to him herein. Sir Wm. Pen told me this day that Mr.
Coventry is to be sworn a Privy Counsellor — at which my soul is
glad. So home and to my letters by the post, and so home — to
supper and bed.
