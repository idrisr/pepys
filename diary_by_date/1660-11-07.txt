office day. Being sent for in the morning, I went by water to my
Lord; where I dined with him. After dinner he bade all go out of the
room, and did tell me how the King hath promised him 4000! per
annum for ever and hath already given hima bill under his hand
(which he showed me) for 4000! that Mr. Fox is to pay him. My
Lord did advise with me how to get this received and to put out
30001 into safe hands at use, and the other he will make use of for
this present occasion. This he did advise with me about with much
Secresy. After all this he called for the Fiddles and books, and we
two and W. Howe and Mr. Childe did sing and play some psalmes
of Will. Lawes and some songs. And so I went away.
