After dinner, laway to Westminster, and up to the Parliament
house and there did wait with great patience, till 7 at night, to be
called in to the Committee, who sat all this afternoon examining the
business of Chatham; and at last was called in and told that the list
they expected from us Mr. Wren had promised them, and only
bade me to bring all my fellow-officers thither to attend them
tomorrow afternoon — Sir Rob. Brookes in the chair; methinks a
sorry fellow to be there, because a young man, and yet he seems to
speak very well.
