Up, and to my Cosen Anth. Joyce’s and there took leave of
my aunt James and both Cosens their wifes, who are this day going
down to my father’s by coach. I did give my aunt xxs. to carry asa
token to my mother, and xs. to Pall. Thence by coach to St. James
and there did our business as usual with the Duke. And saw him
with great pleasure play with his little girle — like an ordinary
private father of a child.
