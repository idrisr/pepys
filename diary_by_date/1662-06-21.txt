Having from my wife and the maids complaints made of the
boy, I called him up and with my whip did whip him till I was not
able to stir, and yet I could not make him confess any of the lies that
they tax him with. At last, not willing to let him go away a
conqueror, I took him in task again and pulled off his frock to his
shirt, and whipped him till he did confess that he did drink the
Whay, which he hath denied. And pulleda pinke, and above all, did
lay the candlesticke upon the ground in his chamber, which he hath
denied this Quarter of this year. I confess it is one of the greatest
wonders that ever I met with, that such a little boy as he could
possibly be able to suffer half so much as he did to maintainalie.
But I think I must be forced to put him away. So to bed, with my
arme very weary. .
