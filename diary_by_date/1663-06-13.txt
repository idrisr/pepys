To the office and there had a difference with Sir W. Batten
about Mr. Bowyers tarr; which I am resolved to cross, though he
sent me last night, asa bribe, a barrell of Sturgeon; which it may be
I
shall send back, for I will not have the King abused so abominably
in the price of what we buy by Sir W. Batten’s corruption and
underhand dealing. So from the office by water, Mr. Wayth with
me, to the Parliament-house; and there I spoke and told Sir G.
Carteret all, with which he is well pleased and doth recall his
willingness, yesterday it seems, to Sir W. Batten, that we should
buy a great Quantity of tarr, being abused by him. Thence with
Mr. Wayth, after drinking a cup of ale at the Swan, talking of the
corruptions of the Navy, by water; Ilanded him at Whitefryers, and
I to the Exchange and so home to dinner, where I find my wife’s
brother; and thence after dinner by water to the Royall Theatre,
where I am resolved to bid farewell, as shall appear by my oaths
tomorrow, against all plays, either at public houses or Court, till
Christmas be over.
