Up very earely and to my office, there preparing letters to my
father, of great import in the settling of our affairs and putting him
upon a way [of] good husbandry —I promising him to make out of
my own purse him up s0/ per annum, till either by my Uncle
Thomas’s death or the fall of the Wardrobe place he be otherwise
provided. That done, I by water to the Strand and there viewed the
Queene-Mother’s works at Somerset house; and thence to the new
playhouse, the second day of its being opened. The play was The
Humorous Lieutenant —a play that hath little good in it. In the dance,
the Tall Devil’s actions was very pretty. The play being done, we
home by water, and to my office to set down this day’s passage.
And though my oath against going to plays doth not oblige me
against this house, because it was not then in being, yet believing
that at that time my meaning was against all public houses, I am
resolved to deny myself the liberty of two plays at Court which are
in arreare to me for the months of March and Aprill; which will
more then countervail this excess. So home to supper. And at
292
supper comes Pembleton; and afterwards we all up to dancing till
late, and so broke up and to bed; and they say that I am like to make
a dancer.
