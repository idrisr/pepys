Being at supper, my wife did say something that caused me to
oppose her in; she used the word “‘Devil,”” which vexed me; and
among other things, I said I would not have her to use that word,
upon which she took me up most scornefully; which before
Ashwell and the rest of the world, I know not nowadays how to
check as I would heretofore, for less then that would have made me
strike her. So that I fear, without great discretion, I shall go near to
lose too my command over her; and nothing doth it more then
giving her this occasion of dancing and other pleasure, whereby her
mind is taken up from her business and finds other sweets besides
pleasing of me, and so makes her that she begins not at all to take
pleasure in me or study to please me as heretofore. But ifthis month
of her dancing were but out (as my first was this night, and Ipaid off
Pembleton for myself), I shall hope with a little pains to bring her to
her old wont. This day, Susan that lived with me lately, being out
of service, and I doubt a simple wench, my wife doth take her for a
little time to try her, at least till she goes into the country; which I
am yet doubtful whether it will be best for me to send her or no, for
fear of her running on in her liberty before Ihave brought her to her
right temper again.
