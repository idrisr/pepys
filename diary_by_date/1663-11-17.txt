With Mr. Moore to my office and there Iread to him the letter
I have writ to send to my Lord, to give him an account how the
world, both City and Court, doth talk of him and his living as he
doth there, in such a poor and bad house, so much to his disgrace —
which Mr. Moore doth conclude so well drawn, that he would not
have me by any means to neglect sending it; assuring me, in the best
of his judgment, that it cannot but endear me to my Lord, instead of
whatI fear, of getting his offence; and did offer to take the same
words and send them, as from him with his hand, to him — which I
am not unwilling should come (if they are at all fit to go) from
anybody but myself. And so he being gone, I did take a copy of it to
keep by me in shorthand, and sealed them up to send tomorrow by
my Will. So home, Mr. Hollyard being come. I had great discourse
with him about my disease. He tells me again that I must eat in a
morning some loosening grewell; and at night, roasted apples. That
I must drink now and then ale with my wine, and eat bread and
butter and honey — and rye bread if I can endure it, it being
loosening. I must also take once a week a glister of his past
prescription; only, honey now and then instead of butter — which
things I am now resolved to apply myself to. He being gone, I to
my office again toa
little business; and then home to supper and to
bed — being ina
little pain by drinking of cold small beer today, and
being in a cold room at the Taverne I believe.
