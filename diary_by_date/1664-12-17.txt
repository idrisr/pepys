Upandto the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon, I
to the Change and there, among others, had my first meeting with
Mr. Lestrange,'who hath endeavoured several times to speak with
me-— it is to get now and then some news of me, which shall as I see
cause give him. He is a man of fine conversation I think; but I am
sure, most courtly and full of compliment. Thence home to dinner;
and then came the looking-glass man to set up the looking-glass |
bought yesterday in my dining-room, and very handsome it is.
