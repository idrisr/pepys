Up; and before I went to the office comes my Taylor with a
coat Ihave made to wear within doors, purposely to come no lower
then my knees; for by my wearing a gown within doors comes all
my tenderness about my legs. There comes also Mr. Reeve with a
Microscope and Scotoscope; for the first I did give him 5] Ios., a
great price; but a most curious bauble it is, and he says as good, nay,
the best he knows in England, and he makes the best in the world.
The other he gives me, and is of value; and a curious curiosity it is to
[see] objects in a dark room with. Mightily pleased with this, I to
the office, where all the morning. There, offered by Sir W. Penn his
coach to go to Epsum and carry my wife, Istepped out and bade my
wife make her ready; but being not very well, and other things
advising me to the contrary, I did forbear going; and so Mr. Creed
dining with me, I got him to give my wife and meaplay this
afternoon, lending him money to do it — which isa
fallacy that I
have found now once to avoid my vowe with, but never to be more
practised I swear. And to the new play at the Dukes house, of
Henery the 5th—a most noble play, writ by my Lord Orery; wherein
Baterton, Harris, and Ianthes parts are most incomparably wrote
and done, and the whole play the most full of heighth and raptures
of wit and sense that ever I heard. Thence home and to my office;
wrote by the post, and then to read a little in Dr. Powre’s booke of
discovery by the Microscope, to enable mea little how to use and
what to expect from my glasse. So to supper and to bed.
