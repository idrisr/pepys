Up, and walked to Greenwich, reading a play, and to the
office, whereI find Sir
J.Mennes gone to the fleet like a doting fool,
to do no good but proclaim himself an asse-— for no service he can do
there, nor inform my Lord (who is come in thither to the Buoy of
the Nore) in anything worth his knowledge. At noon to dinner to
my Lord Bruncker, where Sir W. Batten and his Lady came by
invitation, and very merry we are — only, that the discourse of the
likelihood of the increase of the plague this week makes usalittle
sad. But then again, the thoughts of the late prizes make us glad. At
night to Capt. Cockes, meaning to lie there, it being late; and he not
being home, I walked to him to my Lord Bruncker’s and there
stayed a while, they being at tables; and so by and by parted, and
walked to his house, and after a mess of good broth, to bed in great
pleasure, his company being most excellent.
