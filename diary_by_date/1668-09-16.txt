To the office, and thence to St. James’s to the Duke of York —
walking it to the Temple; and in my way observe that the Stockes
are now pulled quite down, and it will make the coming into
Cornhill and Lumber street mighty noble. I stopped too at Paul’s,
and there did go into St. Fayth’s church and also into the body of the
west part of the church, and do see a hideous sight, of the walls of
the church ready to fall, that I was in fear as long as I was in it. And
here I saw the great vaults underneath the body of the church. No
hurt, I hear, is done yet, since their going to pull down the church
and steeple; but one man, on Monday this week, fell from the top to
a piece of the roof of the east end that stands next the steeple, and
there broke himself all to pieces. It is pretty here, to see how the last
church was but a case brought over the old church; for you may see
the very old pillars standing whole within the wall of this. When I
came to St. James’s, I find the Duke of York gone with the King to
see the muster of the Guards in Hyde Park; and their colonel, the
Duke of Monmouth, to take his command this day of the King’s
Life-Guard, by surrender of my Lord Gerard’s. So I took a hackney
coach and saw it all; and endeed, it was mighty noble and their
945
firing mighty fine, and the Duke of Monmouth in mighty rich
clothes; but the well-ordering of the men I understand not.
