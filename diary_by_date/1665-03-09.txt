Upand to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon to
dinner at home and then abroad with my wife. Left her at the New
Exchange, and I to Westminster, where I hear Mrs. Martin is
brought to bed of a boy and christened Charles — which I am very
glad of, for Iwas fearful of being called to be a godfather to it. But it
seems it was to be done suddenly, and so I escaped. It is strange, to
see how a liberty, and going abroad without purpose of doing
anything, doth lead a man to what is bad; for I was just upon going
to her, where I must of necessity have broken my oath or made a
forfeit. But I did not, company being (Iheard by my porter) with
her; and so I home again, taking up my wife, and was set down by
her at Paules schoole, where I visited Mr. Crumlum at his house.
And Lord, to see how ridiculous a conceited pedagogue is, though
475
a learned man —he is being so dogmaticall in all he doth and says.
But among other discourse, we fall to the old discourse of Pauls
Schoole; and he did, upon my declaring my value of it, give me one
of Lillys grammer of a very old impression, as it was in the
Catholique times; which I shall much set by. And so after some
small discourse, away and called upon my wife at a linen-draper’s
shop buying linen; and so home and to my office, where late, and
home to supper and to bed. This night my wife had a new suit of
Flowerd ash-Coloured silk, very noble.
