Lords day. Up and to dress myself, and then called in to my
wife’s chamber, and there she without any occasion fell to discourse
of my father’s coming to live with us when my sister marries. She
declared if he came, she would not live with me but would shame
me all over the City and Court; which I made slight of, and so we
fell very foul; and Ido find she doth keep very bad remembrances of
my former unkindnesses to her, and doth mightily complain of her
want of money and liberty; which I will rather hear and bear the
complaint of then grant the contrary, and so we had very hot work
a great while; but at last I did declare as Iintend, that my father shall
not come and that he doth not desire and intend it; and so we parted
with pretty good quiet, and so away I; and being ready, went to
church, where first Isaw Ald. Backewell and his lady come to our
church, they living in Mark lane; andI could find my heart to invite
her to sit with us — she beinga fine lady. I came in while they were
singing the 119 Psalm, while the Sexton was gathering to his box,
to which I did give ss. And so after sermon home, my wife, Deb,
864
and I all alone, and very kind, full of good discourse; and after
dinner, I to my chamber, ordering my Tanger accounts to give to
the Auditor in a day or two, which should have been long ago with
him. At them to my great content all the afternoon till supper and
after supper (with my wife, W. Hewer and Deb, pretty merry) till
12 at night, and then to bed.
