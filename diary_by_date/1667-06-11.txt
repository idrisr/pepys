Up, and more letters still from Sir W. Coventry about more
fireships; and so W. Batten and I to the office, where Brouncker
came to us; who is just now going to Chatham upon a desire of
Commissioner Pett’s, who is in a very fearful stink for fear of the
Dutch, and desires help for God and King and kingdom’s sake. So
Brouncker goes down, and Sir
J.Mennes also, from Gravesend.
This morning Pett writes us word that Sherenesse is lost last night,
after two or three hours’ dispute — the enemy hath possessed himself
of the place; which is very sad and puts us into great fears of
Chatham. Sir W. Batten and I down by water to Deptford, and
there Sir W. Penn and we did consider of several matters relating to
the despatchof the Fireshipps; and so W. Batten and I home again —
and there to dinner, my wife and father having dined. And after
dinner, by W. Hewer’s lucky advice, went to Mr. Fenn and did get
him to pay me above 4ool of my Wages, and W. Hewer received it
for me and brought it home this night. Then home and there to our
business, hiring some fireships and receiving every hour almost
letters from Sir W. Coventry, calling for more Fireshipps — and an
order from Council to enable us to take any man’s ships; and Sir W.
Coventry in his letter to us says he doth not doubt but at this time
(under an Invasion, as he owns it to be) the King may by law take
any man’s goods. At this business late, and then home, where a
great deal of serious talk with my wife about the sad state we are in,
and especially from the beating-up of drums this night for the
trainbands, upon pain of death to appear in arms tomorrow
morning, with bullet and powder and money to supply themselfs
with victuals for a fortnight — which, considering the soldiers
drawn out to Chatham and elsewhere, looks as if they had a design
to ruin the City and give it up to be undone- which Ihear makes the
sober citizens to think very sadly of things. So to bed after supper,
ill in my mind.
