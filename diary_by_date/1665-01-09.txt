Up, and walked to Whitehall, it being still a brave frost and Iin
perfect good health, blessed be God. In my way saw a woman that
broke her thigh, in her heels slipping up upon the frosty street. To
the Duke,,and there we did our usual work. Here I saw the Royall
Society bring their new book, wherein is nobly writ their Charter
and laws, and comes to be signed by the Duke as a Fellow; and all
the Fellows’ hands are to be entered there and lie as a monument,
and the King hath put his, with the word “‘Founder’’. Thence I to
Westminster to the Swan to Herberts girl, and lost timealittle with
her. And so took coach, and to my Lord Crews and dined with him;
who receives me with the greatest respect that could be —telling me
that he doth much doubt of the success of this war with Holland: we
going about it, he doubts, by the instigation of persons that do not
enough apprehend the consequences of the danger of it — and
therein I do think with him. Thence to Whitehall to a Tanger
Comittee; where I was accosted and most highly complimented by
my Lord Bellasses our new Governor, beyond my expectation or
measure I could imagine he would have given any man, as ifI were
the only person of business that he intended to rely on, and desires
my correspondence with him. This I was not only surprized at, but
am well pleased with and may make good use of it. Our patent is
renewed, and he and my Lord Barkely and Sir Tho. Ingram put in
as commissioners. Here some business happened which may bring
me some profit. Thence took coach; and:calling my wife at her
tailor’s (she being come this afternoon to bring her mother some
apples, neats tongues and brain) I home, and there at my office late
with Sir W. Warren and had a great deal of good discourse and
counsel from him — which I hopeI
shall take, being all for my good
in my deportment in my office, yet with all honesty. He gone, I
home to supper and to bed.
