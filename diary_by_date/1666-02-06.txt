Up, and to the office, where very busy all the morning; we met
uponareport to the Duke of Yorkeofthe debts of the Navy, which
we finished by 3 a-clock; and having eat one little bit of meat, I by
water before the rest to Whitehall (and they to come after me)
because of a committee for Tanger; where I did my business of
stating my accounts perfectly well and to good liking, and do not
discern but the Duke of Albemarle is my friend in his intentions,
notwithstanding my general fears. After that to our Navy business,
where my fellow-officers were called in; and did that also very well.
And then broke up, and I home by coach, Tooker with me, and
stayed in Lumberdstreete at Viners and sent home for the plate
which my wife and I had a mind to change, and there changed it.
