Though it was an office day, yet I was forced to go to the
Privy Seale; at which I was all the morning. And from thence to my
Lady’s to dinner at the Wardrobe. And in my way, upon the
Thames I saw the King’s new pleasure-boat, that is come now for
the King to take pleasure in above bridge — and also two fine
Gundalo’s! that are lately brought, which are very rich and fine.
