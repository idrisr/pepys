Up; and to the office, where we sat all the morning. And at
noon home with my people to dinner; and thence to the office all the
afternoon, till, my eyes weary, I did go forth by coach to the King’s
playhouse and there saw the best part of The Sea Voyage, where
Knepp I saw do her part of sorrow very well. I afterward to her
house, but she did not come presently home; and here yo did besar
her ancilla, which is so mighty belle. And I to my tailor’s, and to
buy mea belt for my new suit against tomorrow. And so home and
there to my office, and afterward late walking in the garden; and so
home to supper and to bed, after Nell’s cutting of my hair close, the
weather being very hot.
