Up, and eat our breakfast and set out about 9 a-clock; and so to
Barnett, where we stayed and baited (the weather very good all day
and yesterday) and by 5 a-clock got home, where] find all well; and
840
did bring my gold, to my heart’s content, very safe home, having
not this day carried it in a basket but in our hands: the girl took care
of one and my wife another bag, andI the rest — I being afeared of
the bottom of the coach, lest it should break; and therefore was at
more ease in my mind then I was yesterday. At home do find that
Sir W. Batten’s buriall was today; carried from hence with a
hundred or two of coaches to Walthamstow and there buried.
