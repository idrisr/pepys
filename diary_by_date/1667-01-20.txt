Lords day. | to church, and there beyond expectation find our
seat and all the church crammed by twice as many people as used to
be; and to my great joy find Mr. Frampton in the pulpit. So to my
great joy I hear him preach, and I think the best sermon, for
goodness — oratory — without affectation or study — that ever Iheard
in my life. The truth is, he preaches the most like an Apostle that
ever I heard man. And was much the best time that ever I spent in
my life at church. His text, Ecclesiastes 11, verse 8th — the words —
“But if a man live many years and rejoice in them all, yet let him
remember the days of darkness, which shall be many. All that
cometh is vanity.’’ He done, I home; and there Michell and his wife
and we dined, and mighty merry; I mightily taken, more and more,
with her. After dinner, I with my brother away by water to
Whitehall and there walked in the park. Anda little to my Lord
Chancellors, where the King and Cabinet met, and there met Mr.
Brisband, with whom good discourse; to Whitehall towards night,
and there he did lend me the Third Advice to a paynter, a bitter Satyr
upon the service of the Duke of Albemarle the last year. I took it
home with me and will copy it, having the former — being also
mightily pleased with it. So after reading it, I to Sir W. Penn to
discourse a little with him, and so home to supper and to bed.
