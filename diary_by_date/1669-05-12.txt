Upand to Westminster hall, where the term is; and this is the
first day of my being there, and here by chance met Rogr. Pepys,
come to town the last night. I glad to see him. After some talk with
him and others, and among others, Sir Ch. Herberd and Sidny
Mountagu, the latter of whom is to set out tomorrow toward
Flanders and Italy, Iinvited them to dine with me tomorrow; and so
to Mrs. Martin’s lodging, who come to town last night, and there
yo did hazer her, she having been a month, I think, at Portsmouth
with her husband, newly come home from the Streights. But Lord,
how silly the woman talks of her great entertainment there, and
how all the gentry came to visit her, and that she believes her
husband is worth 6 or 700/; which nevertheless I am glad of, but I
doubt they will spend it as fast. Thence home; and after dinner, my
wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there in the side
balcone over against the music, did hear, but not see, a new play,
the first day acted, The Roman Virgin, an old play and but ordinary I
thought; but the trouble of my eyes with the light of the candles did
almost kill me. Thence to my Lord Sandwiches, and there have a
promise from Sidny to come and dine with me tomorrow; and so
my wife and I home in our coach, and there find my Brother John,
as I looked for, come to town from Ellington; where, among other
things, he tells me the first news that my sister is with child and far
gone; which I know not whether it did more trouble or please me,
having no great care for my friends to have children, though I love
other people’s. So, glad to see him, we to supper and so to bed.
