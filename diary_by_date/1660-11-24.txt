At home I havea fire made in my Closett and put my papers
and books and things in order. And that being done, I fell to
entering those two good songs of Mr. Lawes, Helpe, helpe, O helpe
&c. and O God ofheaven and Hell in my song book — to which I have
got Mr. Childe to set the base to the Theorbo. And that done, to
bed.
