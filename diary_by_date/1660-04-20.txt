All the morning I was busy to get my window altered and to
have my table set as I would have it; which after it was done, I was
infinitely pleased with it, and also to see what a command I have to
have everyone ready to come and go at my command. This day one
told me how that at the Eleccion at Cambrige for Knight of the
shire, Wendby and Thornton, by declaring to stand for the
Parliament and a King and the settlement of the Church, did carry it
against all expectation against Sir Dudl. North and Sir Thom.
Willis. I supped tonight with Mr. Sheply below at the half-deck
table; and after that saw Mr. Pickering, whom my Lord brought
down to his cabin; and so to bed.
