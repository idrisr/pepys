Up and to the office, where we sat; and at noon Sir G.
Carteret, Sir
J.Mennes andI to dinner to my Lord Mayors, being
invited; where was the Farmers of the Customes, my Lord
Chancellors three Sons, and other great and much company, and a
very great noble dinner, as this Mayor is good for nothing else. No
extraordinary discourse of anything, every man being intent upon
his dinner, and myself willing to have drunk some wine to have
warmed my belly; but Idid for my oath sake willingly refrain it, but
am so well pleased and satisfied afterwards thereby, for it doth keep
me always in so good a frame of mind that I hope I shall not ever
leave this practice. Thence home and took my wife by coach to
Whitehall; and she set down at my Lord’s lodgings, I to a Comittee
313
of Tanger, and thence with her homeward; called at several places
by the way — among others, at Paul’s churchyard; and while Iwas in
Kirtons shop, a fellow came to offer kindness or force to my wife in
the coach. But she refusing, he went away, after the coachman had
struck him and he the coachman. So I being called, went thither;
and the fellow coming out again of a shop, I did give him a good
cuff or two on the chops; and seeing him not oppose me, I did give
him another; at last, found him drunk, of which I was glad and so
left him and home; and so to my office a while and so home to
supper and to bed.
