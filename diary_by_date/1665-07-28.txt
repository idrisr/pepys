Up betimes, and down to Deptford — where after a little
discourse with Sir G. Carteret, who is much displeased with the
order of our officers yesterday to remove the office to Deptford;
pretending other things, but to be sure it is with regard to his own
house (which is much because his family is going away). Iam glad I
was not at the order-making, and so I will endeavour to alter it. Set
out with my Lady all alone with her with six horses to Dagenhams,
going by water to the Ferry. And a pleasant going and good
discourse — and when there, very merry and the young couple now
well acquainted. But Lord, to see in what fear all the people here do
live would make one mad. They are afeared of us that come to
them, insomuch that I am troubled at it and wish myself away. But
some cause they have, for the Chaplain, with whom but a week or
two ago we were here mighty high disputing, is since fallen into a
fever and dead, being gone hence to a friend’s a good way off—a

sober and healthful man. These considerations make us all hasten
the marriage; and resolve it upon Monday next, which is three days
before we entended it. Mighty merry all of us; and in the evening,
with full content took coach again, and home by daylight with
great pleasure. And thence I down to Woolwich, where find my
wife well; and after drinking and talkingalittle, we to bed.
