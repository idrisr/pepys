All the morning at home about business. At noon to the
Temple; where I stayed and looked over a book or two at Playfords
and then to the Theatre, where I saw a piece of The Silent woman,
which pleased me. So homewards, and in my way bought The
Bondman in Pauls churchyard. And so home — whereIfind all clean
and the harth and range, as it is now enlarged, set up; which pleases
me very much.
