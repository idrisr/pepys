Upand to the office, where all the news this morning is that the
Duch are come witha fleet of 80 sail to Harwich, and that guns were
heard plain by Sir W. Rider’s people at Bednall Greene all yesterday
noon. So to the office we all, and sat all the morning; and then home
to dinner — where our dinner, a ham of French Bacon boiled with
pigeons — an excellent dish. Here dined with us only W. Hewers and
his mother. After dinner to the office again, where busy till night;
and then home and to read a little and then to bed. The news is
confirmed that the Dutch are off of Harwich, but had done nothing
last night. The King hath sent down my Lord of Oxford to raise the
country there; and all the Westerne Barges are taken up to make a
bridge over river about the Hope, for horse to cross the riverifthere
be occasion.
