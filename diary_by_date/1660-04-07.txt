This day, about 9 a-clock in the morning, the wind grew high;
and we being among the sands, lay at anchor. Ibegin to be dizzy and
squeamish. Before dinner, my Lord sent for me down to eat some
oysters, the best my Lord said that ever he eat in his life, though I
have eat as good at Bardsey. After dinner and all the afternoon I
walked upon the deck to keep myself from being sick; and at last,
about 5 a-clock, went to bed and got a caudle made me, and sleep
upon it very well.
