Comes betimes a letter from Sir W. Coventry that he and Sir
G. Carteret are ordered presently down to the fleet. I up, and saw
Sir W. Penn gone also after them; and so], finding it a leisure day,
fell to making clean my closet in my office, which I did to my
content, and set up my Platts again — being much taken also with
Griffin’s maid that did clean it — being a pretty maid. I left her at it
and toward Westminster, myself with my wife, by coach; and
meeting, took up Mr. Lovett the varnisher with us — who is a
pleasant-speaking and humoured man, so my wife much taken
with him, and a good deal of work I believe I shall procure him. |
left my wife at the New Exchange, and myself to the Exchequer to
look after my Tanger tallies; and there met Sir G. Downing, who
showed me his present practice, now begun this day, to paste up
upon the Exchequer door a note of what Orders upon the new Act
are paid and now in paying. And my Lord of Oxford coming by
also, took him and showed him his whole method of keeping his
books, and everything of it, which endeed is very pretty; and at this
day, there is assigned upon the Act 804000l. Thence at the New
Exchange took up my wife again, and so home to dinner. After
dinner to my office again to set things in order. In the evening, out
with my wife and my aunt Wight to take the ayre, and happened to
have a pleasant race between our Hackny coach anda gentleman’s.
At Bow we eat and drank, and so back again, it being very coole in
the evening. Having set home my aunt and come home, I fell to
examine my wife’s kitchen book, and find 20s. mistake, which
made me mighty angry, and great differences between us. And so
in that difference, to bed.
