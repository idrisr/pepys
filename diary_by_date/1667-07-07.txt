Lords day. Up; and to my chamber, there to settle some papers;
803
and thither comes Mr. Moore to me and talked till church-time of
the news of the times about the peace, and the bad consequences of
it if it be not improved to good purpose of fitting ourselfs for
another war. He tells me he hears that the discontented Parliament-
men are fearful that the next sitting the King will put for a general
Excize, by which to raise him money, and then to fling off the
Parliament, and raise a land-army and keep them all down like
slaves; and it is gotten among them that Bab. May, the Privy Purse,
hath been heard to say that 300! a year is enough for any country
gentleman; which makes them mad, and they do talk of 6 or
800000! gone into the Privy Purse this war, when in King James’s
time it arose but to sooo! and in King Charles’s but 1ooool ina year.
He tells me that a goldsmith in town told him, that being with some
plate with my Lady Castlemaine lately, she directed her woman
(the great beauty), ‘““Willson,”’ says she, ‘make a note for this and
for that to the Privy purse for money.”’ Busy till noon and then
home to dinner and Mr. Moore come and dined with us, and much
more discourse at and after dinner of the same kind; and then he
gone, I to my office, busy till the evening; and then with my wife
and Jane over to Halfway house, a very good walk, and there drank;
and in the cool of the evening back again, and sang with pleasure
upon the water and were mightily pleased in hearinga boat full of
spaniards sing; and so home to supper and to bed. Jane of late
mighty fine, by reason of a laced whiske her mistress hath given
her, which makes her a very gracefull servant. But above all, my
wife and I were the most surprized in the beauty of a plain girle
which we met in the little lane going from Redriffe stairs into the
fields, one of the prettiest faces that we think we-ever saw in our
lives.
