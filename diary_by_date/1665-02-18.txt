Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning. At noon to
the Change, and thence to the Royall Oake taverne in Lumbard
Streete, where Sir Wm. Petty and the owners of the Double-
bottomed boat (the Experiment) did entertain my Lord Brunkard,
Sir R. Murry, myself and others with marrow-bones anda chine of
beefe of the victuals they have made for this ship — and excellent
company and good discourse; but above all, I do value Sir Wm.
Petty. Thence home, and took my Lord Sandwiches Draught of the
Harbour of Portsmouth down to Ratcliffe to one Burston, to make
a plat for the King and another for the Duke and another for himself
— which will be very neat. So home, and till almost one a-clock in
the morning at my office; and then home to supper and to bed. My
Lord Sandwich and his fleet of 25 ships in the Downes, returned
from crucing; but could not meet with any Dutchmen.
