Lords day. Up, and expected long a new suit; but coming not,
dressed myself in my late new black silk camelot suit; and when full
495
ready, comes my new one of Colour’d Farrinden, which my wife
puts me out of love with; which vexes [me], but Ithink it is only my
not being used to wear Colours, which makes it look a little unusual
upon me. To my chamber, and there spent the morning reading. At
noon by invitation comes my two cousin Joyces and their wifes —
my aunt James, and he-cousin Harman —his wife being ill. I had a
good dinner for them, and as merry as I could be in such company.
They being gone, I out of doors a
little to show forsooth my new
suit, and back again; and in going, saw poor Dr. Burnets door shut.
But he hath, I hear, gained great goodwill among his neighbours;
for he discovered it himself first, and caused himself to be shut up of
his own accord — which was very handsome. In the evening comes
Mr. Andrews and his wife and Mr. Hill, and stayed and played and
sung and supped — most excellent pretty company; so pleasant,
ingenious, and harmless, I cannot desire better. They gone, we to
bed — my mind in great present ease.
