With Sir G. Carteret by coach to my Lord Treasurer, to
discourse with him about Mr. Gauden’s having of money and to
offer to him whether it would not be necessary, Mr. Gaudens credit
being so low as it is, to take security of him ifhe demands any great
sum, such as 20000/, which now ought to be paid him. My Lord
Treasurer we found in his bed-chamber, being laid up of the goute;
I find him a very ready man and certainly a brave servant to the
King, he spoke so quick and sensibly of the King’s charge. Nothing
displeased me in him but his long nails, which he lets grow upona
pretty thick white short hand, that it troubled me to see them.
Thence with Sir G. Carteret by coach, and he set me down at the
New Exchange. In our way he told me there is no such thing likely
yet as a Dutch war, neither they nor we being in condition for it,
though it will come certainly to that in some time, our interests
lying the same way, that is to say in trade. But not yet.
