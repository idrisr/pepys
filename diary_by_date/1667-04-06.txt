Up, and betimes in the morning down to the Tower wharfe,
there to attend the shipping of soldiers to go down to man some
ships going out; and pretty to see how merrily some and most go
and how sad others, the leave they take of their friends, and the tears
that some wifes and others’ wenches shed to part with them: a
pretty mixture. So to the office, having stayed as long as I could,
and there sat all the morning; and then home at noon to dinner; and
then: abroad, Balty with me, and to Whitehall by water to Sir G.
Carteret about Balty’s 1500/ contingent money for the fleet to the
West Indys; and so away with him to the Exchange and mercers and
drapers, up and down, to pay all my scores occasioned by this
mourning for my mother — and emptied a sol bag; and it was a joy
to me to see that I am able to part with such a sum without much
inconvenience —at least, without any trouble of mind. So [to] Capt.
Cocke’s to meet Fenn to talk about this money for Balty; and there
Cocke tells me that he is confident there will be a peace, whatever
terms be asked us; and he confides that it will take, because the
French and Dutch will be jealous one of another which shall give the
best terms, lest the other should make the peace with us alone, to
the ruin of the third — which is our best defence, this jealousy, for
752
aught I at present see. So home and there very late, very busy; and
then home to supper and to bed —the people having got their house
very clean against Mondy dinner.
