Up, and by water with W. Hewer to the Temple; and thence
to the Chapel of Rolles, where I made enquiry for several Rolles and
was soon informed in the manner of it; and so spent the whole
morning with W. Hewer, he taking little notes in shorthand, while
[hired a clerk there to read to me about twelve or more several rolls
which I did call for: and it was great pleasure to me to see the
method wherein their Rolles are kept; that when the Master of the
Office, one Mr. Case, doth call for them (who is a man that I have
heretofore known by coming to my Lord Sandwiches) he did most
readily turn to them. At noon they shut up, and W. Hewer andI did
walk to the Cocke at the end of Suffolke street, where I never was, a
great ordinary, mightily cried up, and there bespoke a pullet; which
while dressing, he and I walked into St. James’s park, and thence
back and dined very handsome, with a good Soup anda pullet, for
4s.—6d. the whole. Thence back to the Rolles and did a little more
business; and so by water from Whitehall, thither I went to speak
with Mr. Williamson (that if he hath any papers relating to the
Navy, I might see them, which he promises me); and so by water
home, with great content for what Ihave this day found, having got
almost.as much asI desire of the history of the Navy from 1618 to
1642, when the King and Parliament fell out. So home, and did get
my wife to read, and so to supper and to bed.
