Up betimes and to the office, where all the morning —sitting;
and did discover three or four fresh instances of Sir W. Pen’s old
cheating dissembling tricks — he being as false a fellow as ever was
born. Thence with Sir W. Batten and Lord Brouncker to the White
horse in Lumberd street, to dine with Capt. Cocke upon perticular
business of Canvas to buy for the King. And here by chance I saw
the mistress of the house I have heard much of; and a very pretty
woman she is endeed — and her husband the simplest-looked fellow
and old that ever I saw. After dinner I took coach and away to
596
Hales’s, where my wife is sitting; and endeed, her face and neck,
which are now finished, do so please me, that I am not myself
almost, nor was not all the night after, in writing of my letters, in
consideration of the fine picture that I shall be maister of. Thence
home and to the office, where very late, and so home to supper and
to bed.
