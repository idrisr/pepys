Up by 4 a-clock in the morning and fell to the preparing of
some accounts for my Lord of Sandwich. By and by, by
appointment comes Mr. Moore; and by what appears to us at
present, we find that my Lord is above 7000 in debt and that he hath
money coming into him that will clear all; and so we think him clear
— but very little money in his purse. Thence home and to the Trinity
house, where the Bretheren (who have been at Deptford today
choosing a new Maister; which is Sir
J.Minnes, notwithstanding
Sir W. Batten did contend highly for it; at which I am notalittle
pleased, because of his proud Lady) about 3 a-clock came hither,
and so to dinner. I seated myself close by Mr. Prin; who, in
discourse with me, fell upon what records he hath of the lust and
wicked lives of the Nuns heretofore in England, and showed me
out of his pocket one wherein 30 Nuns for their lust were ejected of
their house, being not fit to live there, and by the Popes command
to be put, however, into other Nunnerys. I could not stay to end
dinner with them; but rise and privately went out, and by water to
my brother’s; and thence to take my wife to the Redd bull, where
we saw Dr. Faustus,; but so wretchedly and poorly done, that we
were sick of it—and the worse because by a former resolution it is to
198
be the last play we are to see till Michaelmas. Thence homewards by
coach through Moorefields, where we stood a while and saw the
Wrestling. At home, got my lute upon the Leades and there played;
and so to bed.
