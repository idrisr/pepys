Up, and Willet came home in the morning; and God forgive
me, I could not conceal my content thereat, by smiling, and my
wife observed it; but I said nothing, nor she, but away to the office.
Presently, up by water to Whitehall, and there all of us to wait on
the Duke of York; which we did, having little to do. And then I up
and down the House, till by and by the Duke of York (who had bid
me stay) did come to his closet again, and there did call in me and
Mr. Wren; and there my paper that Ihave lately taken pains to draw
up was read, and the Duke of York pleased therewith; and we did all
along conclude upon answers to my mind for the Board, and that
that, if put in execution, will do the King’s business. But I do now
more and more perceive the Duke of York’s trouble, and that he
doth lie under great weight of mind from the Duke of Buck-
ingham’s carrying things against him; and perticularly when I
advised that he would use his interest that a seaman might come
into the room of W, Penn, who is now declared to be gone from us
to that of the Victualling, and did show how the office would now
be left without one seaman in it but the Surveyor and the
Controller, who is so old as to be able to do nothing. He told me
plainly that I knew his mind well enough as to seamen, but that it
must be as others will. To the Treasurer’s, Sir Tho. Clifford, where
I did go and eat some oysters. Thence with Mr. Povy spent all the
afternoon going up and down among the coachmakers in Cow
lane, and did see several, and at last did pitch upon a
little Chariott,
whose body was framed but not Covered, at the widow’s that made
Mr. Lowther’s fine coach. And we are mightily pleased with it, it
being light, and will be very gent and sober — to be covered with
leather, but yet will hold four. Being much satisfied with this, I
carried him to Whitehall; and so by coach home, where give my
wife a good account of my day’s work; and so to the office and there
late, and so to bed.
