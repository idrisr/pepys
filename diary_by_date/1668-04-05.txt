Lords day. Up, and to my chamber and there to the writing fair
some of my late music notions; and so to church, where I have not
been a good while. And thence home, and dined at home with W.
Hewers with me; and after dinner, he and I a great deal of good talk
touching this office: how itis spoilt by having so many persons in it,
and so much work that is not made the work of any one man but of
all, and so is never done; and that the best way to have it well done
were to have the whole trust in one (as myself) to set whom |
pleased to work in the several businesses of the Office, and me to be
accountable for the whole; and that would do it, as I would find
instruments. But this is not to be compassed; but something I am
resolved to do about Sir
J.Mennes before it be long. Then to my
chamber again, to my music, and so to church; and then home, and
thither comes Capt. Silas Taylor to me, the Storekeeper of
Harwich; where much talk, and most of it against Capt. Deane,
whom I do believe to be a high, proud fellow; but he is an active
man, and able in his way, and so Ilove him. He gone, I to my music
again and to reada
little and to sing with Mr. Pelling, who came to
see me and so spent the evening; and then to supper and to bed. I
hear that eight of the ringleaders in the late tumults of the prentices
at Easter are condemned to die.
