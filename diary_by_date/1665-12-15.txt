Up, and spent all the morning with my Surveyors of the Ports
for the victualling, and there read to them what instructions I had
provided for them, and discoursed largely much of our business
and the business of the pursers. I left them to dine with my people,
and I to my Lord Brunckers, where I met with a great good dinner.
There till almost night, and so away toward the office and in my
way met with Sir James Bunch, and after asking what news, he
cried (Iknow [not] whether in earnest or jest): “Aye,” says he, “this
is the time for you,” says he, “‘that were for Oliver heretofore; you
are full of imployment, and we poor Cavaliers sit still and can get
nothing” — which was a pretty reproach, I thought, but answered
nothing to it, for fear of making it worse. So away, andI to see Mrs.
Penington; but company being to come to her, I stayed not, but to
the office a little; and so home, and after supper to bed.
