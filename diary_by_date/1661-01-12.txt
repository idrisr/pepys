IIo
despayre in love as the Collonell told me, which makes him bad
company, though a most good-natured man), by water to Redriffe;
and so on foot to Deptford -—our servants by water. Where we fell to
choosing four Captains to command the guards, and choosing the
places where to keep them and other things in order thereunto. We
dined at the globe, having our messenger with us to take care for us.
Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the
Captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us. Having stayed very
late there talking with the Collonell, I went home with Mr. Davis,
storekeeper (whose wife is ill anc so I could not see her), and was
there most princlike lodged, with so much respect and honour that I
was almost at a loss how to behave myself.
