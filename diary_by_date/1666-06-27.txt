Up, and to my office awhile. Then down the Rivera
little way
to see vessels ready for the carrying down of 400 land-soldiers to the
fleet. Then back to the office for my papers, and so to St. James’s,
where we did our usual attendance on the Duke. I did this afternoon
visit my Lord Bellasses — who professes all imaginable satisfaction
in me. He spoke dissatisfiedly with Creed, which Iwas pleased well
enough with. My Lord is going down to his Guarrison to Hull, by
the King’s command to put it in order, for fear of an invasion —
which courseI perceive is taken upon the sea-coasts round; for we
have a real apprehension of the King of France’s invading us.
