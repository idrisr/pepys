We had this morning a great dispute between Mr. Gauden,
victualler of the Navy, and Sir J. Lawson and the rest of the
Commanders going out againt Argier, about their fish and keeping
of Lent; which Mr. Gauden so much insists upon to have it
observed, as being the only thing that makes up the loss of his dear
331
bargain all the rest of the year. At noon went home; and thereI find
that one Abrahall, who strikes in for the serving of the King with
Ship-chandlery ware, hath sent my wife a Japan gowne; which
pleases her very well and me also, it coming very opportune — but I
know not how to carry myself to him, Ibeing already obliged so far
to Mrs. Russell — so that I am in both their pays.
