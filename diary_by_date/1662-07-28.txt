Up early; and by 6 a-clock after my wife was ready, I walked
with her to the George and at Holborne conduict, where the Coach
stood to carry her and her maid to Bugden; but that not being
ready, my brother Tom stayed with them to see them gone; and soi
took a troubled, though willing, godbwy, because of the bad
215
condition of my house to have a family in it. So home all alone to
dinner, and then to the office again, and in the evening Cooper
comes; and he being gone, to my chamber alittle troubled and
melancholy; to my lute late, and so to bed — Will lying there at my
feet, and the wench in my house in Will’s bed.
