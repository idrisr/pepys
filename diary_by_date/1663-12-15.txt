‘To my office, and there very late with Sir W. Warren upon
very serious discourse. And in the close, he andI did fall to talk very
openly of the business of this office, and (ifI was not a
little too open
to tell him my interest, which is my fault) he did give me most
admirable advice, and such as doth speak him a most able and
worthy man, and understanding seven times more then ever I
thought to be in him. He did perticularly run over every one of the
officers and Comanders, and showed me how I had reason to
mistrust every one of them, either for their falseness or their over-
great power, being too high to fasten a real friendship in. And did
give me a common but a most excellent [saying] to observe in all
my life; he did give it in rhyme, but the sense was this: that a man
should treat every friend in his discourse and opening of his mind to
him as of one that may hereafter be his foe. He did also advise me
how I should take occasion to make known to the world my care
and the pains that I take in my business; and above all, to be sure to
get a thorough knowledge in my imployment, and to that add all
the Interest at Court that I can - which I hopeI shall do. He stayed
talking with me till almost 12 at night, and so goodnight, being
sorry to part with him and more sorry that he should have as far as
332
Wapping to walk tonight. So I to my Journall and so home - to
supper and to bed.
