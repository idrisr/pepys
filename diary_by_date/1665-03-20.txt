Up, Creed and I, and had Mr. Povy’s coach sent for us, and
we to his house — where we did some business, in order to the work
of this day. Povy and I to my Lord Sandwich, who tells me that the
Duke is not onlya friend to the business, but to me, in terms of the
greatest love and respect and value of me that can be thought; which
overjoys me. The Duke did direct Secretary Bennet, who was
there, to declare his mind to the Committee that he approves of me
for Treasurer, and with a character of me to be a man whose
industry and discretion he would trust as soon as any man’s in
England —and did the like to my Lord Sandwich. So to Whitehall to
the Committee of Tanger and there I received their constitution
under all hands presently, so that I am already confirmed their
Treasurer, and put into a condition of striking of Tallys. And all
without one harsh word or word of dislike; but quite the contrary —
which is a good fortune beyond all imagination. Here we rose, and
Povy and Creed and I, all full ofjoy, thence to dinner — they setting
me down at Sir
J.Winter’s by promise; and dined with him, anda
worthy fine man he seems to be, and of good discourse. Our
business was to discourse of supplying the King with Iron for
Ancors, ifit can be judged good enough. Anda fine thing it is, to see
myself come to the condition of being received by persons of this
rank — he being, and having long been, Secretary to the Queene-
mother.
