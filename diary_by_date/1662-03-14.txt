At the office all the morning. At noon Sir W. Penn and I
making a bargaine with the workmen about his house. In which I
did see things not so well contracted for as I would have, and I was
vexed and made him so too, to see me so criticall in the agreement.
Home to dinner. In the afternoon came the German, Dr Kuffler, to
discourse with us about his Engine to blow up ships. We doubted
not [the] matter of fact, it being tried in Cromwells time, but the
184
safety of carrying them in ships. We concluded nothing, but shall
discourse with the Duke of Yorke tomorrow about it. Then to my
lute, upon which I have not played a week or two; and trying over
the two songs of Nulla nulla, &c and Gaze not on Swans, which Mr.
Berchinsha set for me a little while ago, I find them most
incomparable songs as he hath set them — of which I am nota
little
proud, because I am sure none in the world hath them but myself,
not so much as he himself that set them. So to bed.
