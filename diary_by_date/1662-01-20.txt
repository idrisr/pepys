passed in the office. Which is very long — and we were all at it till
noon. Then to dinner, he providing afine dinner for us; and we eate
it at Sir Wm. Batten’s, where we were very merry, there being at
174
table the Treasurer and we three — Mr. Wayth, Fenn, Smith,
Turner, and Mr Morrice the Wine Cooper (who this day did divide
the two butts, which we four did send for, of Sherry from Cales,
and mine was put into a hogshead and the vessell filled up with four
gallons of Malago wine; but what it will stand us in Iknow not, but
it is the first great Quantity of wine that I ever bought). And after
dinner to the office all the afternoon, till late at night. And then
home, where my aunt and uncle Wight and Mrs. Anne Wight came
to play at Cards (at gleeke, which she taught me and my wife the
last week); and so to supper and then to Cards, and so good-night.
Then Ito my practice of Musique and then at 12 a-clock to bed. This
