Mr. Davies told us the perticular examinations of these
Fanatiques that are taken. And in short it is this: Of all these
Fanatiques that have done all this; viz., routed all the train-bands
that they met with — put the King’s lifeguard to the run — killed
about 20 men — broke through the City gates twice — and all this in
the daytime, when all the City was in armes—are not in all above 31.
Whereas we did believe them (because they were seen up and down
in every place almost in the City, and have been about Highgate
two or three dayes, and in several other places) to be at least 500. A
thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do
so much mischief. Their word was “‘King Jesus, and the heads!
upon the gates!”’ Few of them would receive any Quarter but such
as were taken by force and kept alive, expecting Jesus to come and
reign here in the world presently,*and will not believe yet but their
work will be carried on, though they do die.
