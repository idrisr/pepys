she used to make coal fires and wash my foul clothes with her own
hand for me, poor wretch, in our little room at my Lord
Sandwiches; for which I ought for ever to love and admire her, and
do, and persuade myself she would do the same thing again if God
should reduce us to it. So up, and by coach abroad to the Duke of
Albemarle’s about sending soldiers down to some ships; and so
home, calling at a belt-makers to mend my belt, and so home and to
dinner, where pleasant with my wife; and then to the office, where
mighty busy all the day, saving going forth to the Change to pay for
some things and on other occasions; and at my goldsmith’s did
observe the King’s new Medall, where in little there is Mrs.
Stewards face, as well done as ever Isaw anything in my whole life I
think — and a pretty thing it is that he should choose her face to
represent Britannia by. So at the office late very busy, and much
business with great joy despatched; and so home to supper and to
bed.
