Up, and by water to Charin cross stairs, and thence to W.
Coventry to discourse concerning the state of matters in the Navy,
where he perticularly acquainted me again with the trouble he is like
to meet with about the selling of places, all carried on by Sir Fr.
Hollis; but he seems not to value it, being able to justify it to be
lawful and constant practice, and never by him used in the least
degree since he upon his own motion did obtain a salary of 5ool in
lieu thereof. Thence to the Treasury chamber abouta
little business
and so home by coach; and in my way did meet W. How going to
the Commissioners of Accounts; I stopped and spoke to him, and
he seems well resolved what to answer them, but he will find them
very strict and not easily put off. So home and there to dinner; and
after dinner comes W. How to tell me how he sped; who says he
was used civilly and not so many questions asked as he expected,
but yet I do perceive enough to show that they do entend to know
the bottom of things and where to lay the great weight of the
disposal of these East India goods, and that they entend plainly to
do upon my Lord Sandwich.
