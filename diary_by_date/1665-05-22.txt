Up, and down to the ships, which now are hindered from
going to the fleet (to our great sorrow and shame) with the
provisions, the wind being against them. So to the Duke of
Albemarle — and thence down by water to Deptford, it being
Trinity Monday and so the day of choosing the Master of Trinity
house for the next year — where, to my great content, I find that
contrary to the practice and design of Sir W. Batten to break the rule
and custom of the Company in choosing their Masters by
succession, he would have brought in Sir W. Rider or Sir W. Pen
over the head of Hurleston (who is a knave too besides, I believe):
the Younger Brothers did all oppose it against the Elder, and with
great heat did carry it for Hurleston — which I know will vex him to
the heart. Thence, the election being over, to church; where an idle
sermon from that conceited fellow Dr. Britton, saving that his
advice to unity and laying aside all envy and enmity among them
was very apposite. Thence walked to Redriffe, and so to the Trinity
house; and a great dinner, as is usual. And so to my office, where
busy all the afternoon till late; and then home to bed — beingmuch
troubled in mind for several things. First, for the condition of the
fleet for lack of provisions. The blame this office lies under, and the
shame that they deserve to have brought upon them for the ships
not being gone out of the River. And then for my business of
Tanger, which is not settled; and lastly, for fear that I am not
observed to have attended the office business of late as much as I
ought to do, though there hath been nothing but my attendance on
Tanger that hath occasioned my absence, and that of late not much.
