Up, and all the morning busy at the office with Sir W. Warren
about a great contract for New England Masts; wherein I was very
hard with him, even to the making him angry. But Ithoughtit fit to
do it, as well as just for me on the King’s behalf. At noon to the
Changea
little; and so to dinner and then out by coach, setting my
wife and maid down, going to Stevens the Silversmith’s to change
A414
some old silver lace and to go buy new silk lace for a petticoat. I to
Whitehall and did much business at a Tanger committee — where
among other things, speaking about propriety of the houses there
and how we ought to let the portugeses have right done them, as
many of them as continue or did sell the houses while they were in
possession — and something further in their favour — the Duke (in an
anger I never observed in him before) did cry, says he, “All the
world rides us, and I think we shall never ride anybody.” Thence
home; and though late, yet Pedro being there he sang a song and
parted; I did give him $s., but find it burdensome and so will break
up the meeting.
