Up and all the morning at the office, where we sat. At noon
home to dinner; and presently my wife and I and Sir W. Penn to the
King’s playhouse, where the house extraordinary full; and there
was the King and Duke of York to see the new play, Queen
Elizabeths Troubles, and the History ofEighty-Eight. | confess I have
sucked in so much of the sad story of Queen Elizabeth from my
cradle, that I was ready to weep for her sometimes. But the play is
the most ridiculous that sure ever came upon stage, and endeed is
merely a show; only, shows the true garbe of the queens in those
819
days, just as we see Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth painted — but
the play is merely a puppet-play acted by living puppets. Neither
the design nor language better; and one stands by and tells us the
meaning of things. Only, I was pleased to see Knipp dance among
the milkmaids, and to hear her sing a song to Queen Elizabeth — and
to see her come out in her nightgowne, with no locks on, but her
bare face and hair only tied up in a knot behind; which is the
comeliest dress that ever I saw her in to her advantage. Thence
home and went as far as Mile end with Sir W. Penn, whose coach
took him up there for his country-house; and after having drunk
there at the Rose and Crowne, a good house for Ald. Bides Ale, we
parted; and we home, and there Ifinished my letters and then home
to supper and to bed.
