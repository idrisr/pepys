The Duke of York and all with him this morning were full of
the talk of the prentices, who are not yet down, though the Guards
and militia of the town have been in arms all this night and the night
before; and the prentices have made fools of them, sometimes by
running from them and flinging stones at them. Some blood hath
894
been spilt, but a great many houses pulled down; and among
others, the Duke of York was mighty merry at that of Damaris
Page’s, the great bawd of the seamen. And the Duke of York
complained merrily that he hath lost two tenants by their houses
being pulled down, who paid him for their wine licences 15/ a year.
But here it was said how these idle fellows have had the confidence
so say that they did ill in contenting themselfs in pulling down the
little bawdy houses and did not go and pull down the great bawdy
house at Whitehall. And some of them have the last night had a
word among them, and it was ‘Reformation and Reducement!”’
This doth make the courtiers ill at ease to see this spirit among
people, though they think this matter will not come to much; but it
speaks people’s mind. And then they do say that there are men of
understanding among them, that have been of Cromwell’s army;
but how true that is I know not.
