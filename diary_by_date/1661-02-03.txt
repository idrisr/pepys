Lordsday. This day I first begun to go forth in my coate and
sword, as the manner now among gentlemen is. To Whitehall. In
my way heard Mr. Tho. Fuller preach at the Savoy upon our
forgiving of other men’s trespasses — showing, among [other]
things, that we are to go to law never to Revenge, but only to
repayre — whichI think a good distinction. So to Whitehall, where I
stayed to hear the trumpets and kettle-drums — and then the other
drums; which is much cried up, though I think it dull, vulgar
music.
