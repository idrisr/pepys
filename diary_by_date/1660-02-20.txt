In the morning at my lute. Then to my office, where my
partener and I made even our balance. Took him home to dinner
with me, where my Brother John came to dine with me. After
dinner I took him to my study at home and at my Lord’s, and gave
him some books and other things against his going to Cambrige.
After he was gone, I went forth to Westminster hall, where I met
with Chetwind, Simons and Gregory; and with them to Marshes at
Whitehall to drink, and stayed there a pretty while reading a
pamphlet, well-writ and directed to Gen. Monke in praise of the
form of Monarchy which was settled here before the Warrs. In the
evening Simons and I to the Coffee Clubb, where nothing to do.
After a small debate upon the Question whether learned or
unlearned subjects are the best, the club broke off very poorly, andI
_do not think they will meet any more. Hence with Vines &c to
Wills; and after a pot or two, home; and so to bed.
