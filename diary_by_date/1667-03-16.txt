Mennes, who hath been down, but to little purpose, to pay the
ships below at the Nore. This evening, having done my letters, I
did write out the heads of what I had prepared to speak to the King

again, after much cold weather; and it is observable that within
these eight days I did see smoke remaining, coming out of some
cellars, from the late great Fire, now above six months since. There
was this day at the office (as he is most days) Sir W. Warren; against
whom I did manifestly plead, and heartily too, God forgive me —
but the reason is because I do find that he doth now wholly rely
almost upon my Lord Brouncker.
