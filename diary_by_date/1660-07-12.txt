Up early, and by coach to Whitehall, with Commissioner
Pett; where after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy
Seal and got my bill’ perfected there and at the Signett: and then to
the House of Lords and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to
Mr. Beale to get my patent ingrossed. But he not having time to get
it done in Chancery hand, I was forced to run all up and down
Chancery lane and the Six Clerks’ Office, but could find none that
could write that hand that were at leisure: and so in a despair went to
the Admiralty, where we met the first time there - my Lord
Mountagu, my Lord Barkely, Mr. Coventry, and all the rest of the
Principall Officers and Commissioners, only the Controller who is
not yet chosen. At night to Mr. Spong’s and there Igot him to come
to me to my Lord’s lodgings at 11 a-clock of night, where I got him
to take my bill to write it himself (which was a great providence that
he could do it) against tomorrow morning. I late writing letters to
sea by the post. And so went home to bed, in great trouble because I
heard at Mr. Beales today that Barlow hath been there and said that
he would make a stop in that business.
