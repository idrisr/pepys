This morning, sending the boy down into the cellar for some
beer, I fallowed him with a cane, and did there beat him for his
staying of arrands and other faults, and his sister came to me down
and begged for him: so I forebore. And afterwards in my wife’s
chamber did there talk to Jane how much I
did love the boy for her
sake and how much it doth concern to correct the boy for his faults,
or else he would be undone. So at last she was well pleased. This
morning Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Batten and I met at the office and
did conclude of our going to Portsmouth next week. In which, my
1. Field had been imprisoned for slandering the Navy Board. He now brought
actions for wrongful arrest against the Board collectively and Pepys and Batten
individually, on the ground that the Board had no powers of magistracy in the
City. He won the cases but was awarded only small damages. In 1664 an act was
passed giving the Board the required powers.

mind is at a great loss what to do with my wife, for I cannot
persuade her to go to Brampton and I am loath to leave her at home.
All the afternoon in several places to put things in order for my
going. At night home and to bed.
