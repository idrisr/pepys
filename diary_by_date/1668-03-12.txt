Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home;
and after dinner with wife and Deb, carried them to Unthankes; and
Ito Westminster hall, expecting our being with the Committee this
886
afternoon about Victualling business, but once more waited in
vain. So after a turn or two with Lord Brouncker, Itook my wife up
and left her at the Change, while I to Gresham College, there to
show myself, and was there greeted by Dr. Wilkins, Whistler, and
others, as the patron of the Navy Office and one that got great fame
by my late speech to the Parliament. Here I sawagreat trial of the
goodness of a burning-glass, made of a new figure, not Sphericall
(by one Smithys, I think they call him), that did burn a glove of my
Lord Brouncker’s from the heat of a very little fire - which a
burning-glass of the old form, very much bigger, could not do -
which was mighty pretty. Here I heard Sir Rob. Southwell give an
account of some things committed to him by the Society at his
going to Portugall, which he did deliver in a mighty handsome
manner. Thence went away home, and there at my office as long as
my eyes would endure; and then home to supper and to talk with
Mr. Pelling, who tells me what a fame Ihave in the City for my late
performance; and upon the whole, I bless God for it, I think I have,
ifI can keep it, done myself
a great deal of repute. So by and by to
bed.
