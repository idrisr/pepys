Friday. Up, finding our beds good, but we lousy; which made
us merry. We set out, the reckoning and servants coming to 9s. 6d.;
my guide thither, 2s.; coachman, advanced, 10s. So rode a very
good way, led to my great content by our landlord to Phillip’s
Norton, with great pleasure, being now come into Somersetshire;
where my wife and Deb mightily joyed thereat, I commending the
country, as endeed it deserves. And the first town we came to was
Brekington where, we stopping for something for the horses, we
called two or three little boys to us, and pleased ourselfs with their
manner of speech, and did make one of them kiss Deb, and another
say the Lord’s Prayer (hallowed be thy Kingdom come). At Ph.
Norton I walked to the church, and there saw a very ancient tomb
of some Kt. Templar, I think;' and here saw the tombstone
whereon there were only two heads cut, which, the story goes, and
credibly, were two sisters, called the Fair Maids of Foscott, that had
two bodies upward and one below, and there lie buried. Here is also
a very fine ring of six bells, and chimes mighty tuneable. Having
dined very well, 10s., we come before night to the Bath; where I
presently stepped out with my landlord, and saw the baths, with
people in them. They are not so large as Iexpected, but yet pleasant;
and the town most of stone, and clean, though the streets generally
narrow. I home, and being weary, went to bed without supper; the
rest supping.
