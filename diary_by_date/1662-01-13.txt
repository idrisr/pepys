All the morning at home, and Mr. Berchenshaw (whom I
have not seen a great while, came to see me), who stayed with me a
great while talking of Musique; and I am resolved to begin to learne
of him to compose and to begin tomorrow, he giving of me so great
hopes that I shall soon do it. Before 12 a-clock comes by
appointment Mr. Peter and the Deane and Coll. Honiwood,
brothers, to dine with me. But so soon that I was troubled at it. But
however, I entertained them with talk and oysters till one a-clock;
and then we sat down to dinner. Mr. Peter after dinner did show us
the experiment (which I have heard talk of) of the Chymicall
glasses, which break all to dust by breaking off the little small end -
which is a great mystery to me.
