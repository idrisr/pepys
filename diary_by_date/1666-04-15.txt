Easter day. Up, and by water to Westminster to the Swan to
lay down my cloak, and there found Sarah alone; with whom after I
had stayed awhile, I to Whitehall chapel; and there coming late,
could hear nothing of the Bishop of London’s sermon; so walked
into the park to the Queen’s chapel and there heard a good deal of
their mass and some of their Musique, which is not so contempt-
ible, Ithink, as our people would make it, it pleasing me very well —
606
and indeed, better then the Anthemne I heard afterward at
Whitehall at my coming back. I stayed till the King went down to
receive the Sacrament; and stood in his Closett with a great many
others and there saw him receive it — which I did never see the
manner of before. But do see very little difference between the
degree of the ceremonies used by our people in the administration
thereof and that in the Roman church, saving that methought our
chapel was not so fine, nor the manner of doing it so glorious, as it
was in the Queenes chapel. Thence walked to Mr. Pierce’s and there
dined, I alone with him and her and their children. Very good
company, and good discourse, they being able to tell me all the
businesses of the Court — the Amours and the mad doings that are
there— how for certain, Mrs. Steward doth do everything now with
the King that a mistress should do — and that the King hath many
bastard children that are known and owned, besides the Duke of
Monmouth. After a great deal of this discourse — I walked thence
into the park, with her little boy James with me, who is the wittiest
boy, and the best company in the world. And so back again through
Whitehall both coming and going. And people did generally take
him to be my boy — and some would ask me.
