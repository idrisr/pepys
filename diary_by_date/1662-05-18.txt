Whitsunday. By water to Whitehall and there to Chappell in
my pew, belonging me as Clerk of the Privy Seale. And there I
heard a most excellent sermon of Dr. Hacke[t], Bishop of Lichfield
and Coventry — upon these words: “Hee that drinketh this water
shall never thirst.’’ We had an excellent Anthemne sung by Capt.
1. For his aunt, Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia (d. 13 February).
2. Lady Mountagu’s daughters, Jemima, Paulina and Anne.

Cooke and another, and brave Musique; and then the King Come
down and offered, and took the Sacrament upon his Knees —a sight
very well worth seeing. Thence with Sir G. Carteret to his lodgeing
to dinner, with his Lady. We were very merry, and good discourse,
and Ihad much talk with my Lady —after dinner; and so to Chappell
again and there had another good Anthemne of Capt. Cookes.
Thence to the Councell Chamber; where the King and Council sat
till almost 11 a-clock at night, and I forced to walk up and down the
gallerys till that time of night. They were reading all the bills over
that are to pass tomorrow at the House, before the King’s going out
of towne — and prorogueing the House.
