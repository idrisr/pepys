Abroad with Mr. Creede, of whom I informed myself of all I
have a mind to know. Among other things — the great difficulty my
Lord hath been in all this summer for lack of good and full orders
from the King — and I doubt our Lords of the Council do not mind
things as the late powers did, but their pleasures or profit more.
That the Huego de Toros is a simple sport, yet the greatest in Spaine.
That the Queene hath given no rewards to any of the Captaines or
Officers, but only to my Lord Sandwich; and that was a bag of gold
(which was no honourable present) of about 1400! Sterling. How
recluse the Queene hath ever been and all the voyage never came
upon the deck, or put her head out of her Cabin — but did love my
Lord’s musique; and would send for it down to the stateroom, and
she set in her Cabin within hearing of it. That my Lord was forced
to have some clashing with the Council of Portugall about payment
of the porcion before he could get it — which was, besides Tanger
anda free trade in the Indys, two millions of crownes — half now,
and the other half in twelve months. But they have brought but
little money; but the rest in Sugars and other Commoditys, and
bills of Exchange. That the King of Portugall is a very foole almost,
and his mother doth all.
