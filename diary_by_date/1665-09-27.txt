Up, and saw and admired my wife’s picture of Our Saviour,
now finished, which is very pretty. So by water to Greenwich to
Mr. Evelins, where much company, and thence in his coach with
him to the Duke of Albemarle by Lambeth, who was in a mighty
pleasant humour. There the Duke tells us that the Dutch do stay
abroad, and our fleet must go out again, or to be ready to do so.
Here we got several things ordered as we desired, for the relief of
the prisoners and sick and wounded men. Here I saw this week’s
Bill of Mortality, wherein, blessed be God, there is above 1800
decrease, being the first considerable decrease we have had. Back
again the same way, and had most excellent discourse of Mr.
Eveling touching all manner of learning; wherein I find him a very

fine gentleman, and perticularly of Paynting, in which he tells me
the beautiful Mrs. Middleton is rare, and his own wife doth brave
things. He brought me to the office, whither comes unexpectedly
Capt. Cocke, who hath brought one parcel of our goods by
waggons. And at first resolved to have lodged them at our office;
but then the thoughts of its being the King’s house altered our
resolution, and so put them at his friend’s, Mr. Glanvill’s, and there
they are safe: would the rest of them were so too. In discourse we
came to mention my profit, and he offers me soo! profit clear, and I
demand 600! for my certain profit. We part tonight, and Ilie there at
Mr. Glanvill’s house, there being none there but a maydservant and
a young man.
