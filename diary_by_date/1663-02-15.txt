Lords day. Sending Will to church, myself stayed at home,
hanging up in my green chamber my picture of the Soveraigne and
putting some things in order there. So to dinner to three Duckes
and two Teales, my wife and I. Then to church, where a dull
258
sermon; and so home and after walking about the house a while,
discoursing with my wife, I to my office, there to set down
something and prepare businesses for tomorrow — having in the
morning read over my vowes, which through sickness I could not
do the last Lord’s day, and not through forgetfulness or negligence;
so that I hope it is no breach of my vowe not to pay my forfeiture.
So home, and after prayers to bed — talking long with my wife and
teaching her things in Astronomy.
