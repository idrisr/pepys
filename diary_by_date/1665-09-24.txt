Lords day. Waked, and up and drank and then to discourse.
And then, being about Grayes and a very calme curious morning —
we took our wherry, and to the Fishermen and bought a great deal
of fine fish — and to Gravesend to Whites and had part of it dressed.
And in the meantime, we to walk about a mile from the town, and
so back again. And there, after breakfast, one of our watermen told
us he had heard of
a bargain of Cloves for us. And we went to a
blind alehouse at the further end of the town, to a couple of
$32
wretched, dirty seamen, who, poor wretches, had got together
about 37 /b of Cloves and 10 /b of Nuttmeggs. And we bought them
of them —the first at 5s.-6d. per /b., and the latter at 4s. — and paid
them in gold; but Lord, to see how silly these men are in the selling
ofit, and easily to be persuaded almost to anything — offering a bag
to us, to pass as 20/b of cloves which upon weighing proved 25 /b.
But it would never have been allowed by my conscience to have
wronged the poor wretches, who told us how dangerously they
had got some and dearly paid for the rest of these goods. By and by
to dinner about 3 a-clock. And then I
in the cabin to writing down
my journall for these last seven days, to my great content —it having
pleased God that in this sad time of the plague, everything else hath
conspired to my happiness and pleasure, more for these last three
months then in all my life before in so little time. God long preserve
it, and make me thankful for it. After finishing my Journall, then to
discourse and to read, and then to supper and to bed, my mind not
being at full ease, having not fully satisfied myself how Capt.
Cocke will deal with me as to the share of the profits.
