Up, and my wife not come home all night. To the office,
where sat all the morning. At noon to Starkys, a great cook’s in
Austin Fryers, invited by Coll. Atkins, and a good dinner for Coll.
Norwood and his friends; among others, Sir Edw. Spragg and
584
others — but ill attendance. Before dined, called on by my wife ina
coach; and so Itook leave, and there with her and Knipp and Mercer
(Mr. Hunt, newly come out of the country, being there also, come
to see us) to Mr. Hales the painter’s, having set down Mr. Hunt by
the way. Here Mr. Hales begun my wife in the posture we saw one
of my Lady Peters, like a St. Katharine. While he painted, Knipp
and Mercer and I sang; and by and by comes Mrs. Pierce with my
name in her bosom for her Valentine, which will cost me money.
But strange, how like his very first dead Colouring is, that it did me
good to see it, and pleases me mightily — and Ibelieve will be a noble
picture. Thence with them all as far as Fleet street and there set
Pierce and Knipp down; and we home, I to the office, whither the
Houb[l]ons come, telling me ofa little new trouble from Norwood
about their ship, which troubles me, though without reason. So late
home to supper and to bed.
