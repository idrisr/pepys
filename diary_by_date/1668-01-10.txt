This day I received a letter from my father and another from
my Cosen Roger Pepys, who have had a view of Jackson’s
evidences of his estate and do mightily like of the man and his
condition and estate, and do advise me to accept of the match for
my sister and to finish it as soon as I can; and he doth it so as Iconfess
Iam contented to have it done, and so give her her portion; and so I
shall be eased of one care how to provide for her. And do in many
respects think that it may be a match proper enough to have her
married there, and to one that may look after my concernments if
my father should die and I continue where I am. And there[fore] I
am well pleased with it. And so to bed.
