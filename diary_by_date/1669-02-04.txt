Up and at the office all the morning. At noon, home with my
people to dinner; and then after dinner comes Mr. Spong to see me,
and brings me my parrallogram in better order then before, and
two or three drafts of the port of Brest, to my great content: and |
did call Mr. Gibson to take notice of it, who is very much pleased
therewith. And it seems this is not, as Mr. Sheres would the other
day have persuaded me, the same as a Protractor — which doth so
much the more make me value it; but of itself it is a most useful
instrument. Thence out with my wife and him, and carried him toa
instrument-maker’s shop in Chancery lane that was once a prentice
_ of Greatorex’s, but the master was not within; and there he showed
mea paralellogram in brass, which I
like so well that I will buy, and
therefore bid it be made clean and fit for me. And so to my cousin
Turner’s and there just spoke with The[oph]., the mother not being
at home; and so to the New Exchange and thence home to my
letters; and so home to supper and to bed.
