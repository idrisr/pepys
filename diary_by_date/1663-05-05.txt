Tomy office, busy late, writing letters; and then came Sir W.
Warren, staying for a letter in his business by the post, and while
that was writing, he and I talk about merchandise, trade and getting
of money. I made it my business to enquire what way there is for a
man bred like me to come to understand anything of trade. He did
most discretely answer me in all things, showing me the danger for
me to meddle either in ships or merchandise of any sort, or
ora
common Stockes, but what I have, to keep at interest, which is a
good, quiet and easy profit and once in a little while something
offers that with ready money you may make use of money to good
profit — wherein I concur much with him, and parted late with great
pleasure and content in his discourse; and so home to supper and to
bed.
