Lords day. Up, and several people about business came to me
by appointment, relating to the office; thence I to my closet about
my Tanger papers. At noon dined. And then I abroad by water, it
raining hard, thinking to have gone down to Woolwich; but I did
not, but back through bridge to Whitehall — where after I had
again visited Sir G. Carteret and received his (and now his Lady’s)
full content in my proposal, I went to my Lord Sandwich; and
having told him how Sir G. Carteret received it, he did direct me
to return to Sir G. Carteret and give him thanks for his kind
reception of this offer, and that he would the next day be willing
to enter discourse with him about that business. Which message I
did presently do, and so left the business, with great joy to both
sides. My, Lord, I perceive, entends to give soool with her, and
expects about 800/ per annum joynture. So by water home and to
supper and bed, being weary with long walking at Court. But had
a psalm or two with my boy and Mercer before bed, which
pleased me mightily.
