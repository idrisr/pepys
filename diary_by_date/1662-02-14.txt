Valentine’s day. I did this day purposely shun to be seen at Sir
W. Battens — because I would not have his daughter to be my
Valentine,” as she was the last year, there being no great friendship
between us now as formerly. This morning in comes W. Bowyer,
who was my wife’s Valentine, she having (at which I made good
sport to myself) held her hands all the morning, that she might not
see the paynters that were at work in gilding my chimny-piece and
pictures in my dining-room.
