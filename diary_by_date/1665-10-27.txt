Up, and after some pleasant discourse with my wife, I out,
leaving her and Mrs. Ferrers there; and I to Capt. Cocke’s, there to
do some business; and then away with Cocke in his coach through
Kent street, a miserable, wretched, poor place, people sitting sick
and muffled up with plasters at every four or five door. So to the
Change, and thence I by water to the Duke of Albemarle; and there
much company, but Istayed and dined, and he makes mighty much
of me; and here he tells us the Dutch are gone, and have lost above
160 cables and anchors through the last foul weather. Here he
proposed to me from Mr. Coventry (as I had desired of Mr.
Coventry) that I should be Surveyor-Generall of the victualling
business, which I accepted. But endeed, the terms in which Mr.
Coventry proposes it for me are the most obliging that ever I could
expect from any man, and more — it saying me to be the fittest man
in England, and that he is sure, ifIwill undertake it, Iwill perform it
—and that it will be also a very desirable thing that I might have this
546
encouragement, my encouragement in the Navy alone being in no
wise proportionable to my pains or deserts. This, added to the letter
Ihad three days since from Mr. Southerne, signifying that the Duke
of Yorke had in his master’s absence opened my letter and
commanded him to tell me that he did approve of my being the
Surveyor-general, doth make me joyful beyond myself, that I
cannot express it; to see that as I do take pains, so God blesses me
and hath sent me masters that do observe that I take pains.
