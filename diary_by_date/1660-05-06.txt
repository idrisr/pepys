Lords day. This morning, while we were at sermon, comes in
Dr. Clarges and a Dozen gentlemen with him to see my Lord— who
after sermon dined with him. I remember that last night, upon
discourse concerning Clarges, my Lord told me that he was a man
of small entendimiento. It fell very well today; a stranger preached
here today for Mr. Ibbott, one Mr. Stanly, who prayed for King
Charles, by the Grace of God, &c., which gave great contentment
to the gentlemen that were on board here, and said they would talk
of it when they came to Breda, as not having it done yet in London
so publicly. After they were gone from on board, my Lord writ a

letter to the King and gave it me [to] carry privately to Sir W.
Compton on board the Assistance, which I did; and after a health to
his Majesty on board there, I left them under sail for Breda: back
again and found them at sermon; I went up to my cabin and looked
over my accounts, and found that all my debts paid and my
preparation to sea paid for, I have above 4ol clear in my purse. After
supper to bed.
