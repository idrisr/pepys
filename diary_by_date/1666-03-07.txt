Up betimes and to St. James’s, thinking Mr. Coventry had lain
there, but he doth not, but at Whitehall; so thither Iwent, and had as
good a time as heart could wish; and after an hour in his chamber
about public business, he and Iwalked up; and the Duke being gone
abroad, we walked an hour in the Matted Gallery, he of himself
beginning to:discourse of the unhappy differences between him and
my Lord of Sandwich, and from the beginning to the end did run
through all passages wherein my Lord hath at any time gathered
any dissatisfaction, and cleared himself to me most honourably; and
in truth, I do believe he doth as he says. And when I said I was
jealous of myself, that having now come to such an income as I am
by his favour, I should not be found to do as much service as might
deserve it, he did assure me he thinks it not too much for me, but
thinks Ideserve it as much as any manin England. All this discourse
did cheer my heart, and sets me right again, after a good deal of
melancholy, out of fears of his disinclination to me upon the
differences with my Lord Sandwich and Sir G. Carteret; but Iam
satisfied thoroughly, and so went away quite another man, and by
the grace of God will neverlose it again by my folly in not visiting
and writing to him as I used heretofore to do. Thence by coach to
the Temple; and home and to writing and hear my boy play on the
lute, and a turn with my wife pleasantly in the garden by
moonshine, my heart being in great peace. And so home to supper
and to bed. The King and Duke are to go tomorrow to Audly end in
order to the seeing and buying of it of my Lord Suffolke.
