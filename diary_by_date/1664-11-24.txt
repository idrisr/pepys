Upandto the office, where all the morning busy answering of
people. About noon out with Comissioner Pett, and he and I to a
Coffee-house to drink Jocolatte, very good; and so by coach to
Westminster, being the first day of the Parliaments meeting. After
the House had received the King’s speech and what more he had to
say, delivered in writing (the Chancellor being sick), it rose; and I
with Sir Ph. Warwicke home and conferred our matters about the
charge of the Navy, and am more to give him in the excessive
charge of this year’s expense. I dined with him, and Mr. Povy with
us and Sir Edmd. Pooly, a fine gentleman, and Mr. Chichly; and
fine discourse we had and fine talk — being proud to see myself
accepted in such company and thought better then I am. After
dinner Sir Phillip and I to talk again; and then away home to the
office, where sat late, beginning our sittings now in the afternoon
because of the parliament; and they being rose, I to my office,
where late, till almost one a-clock and then home to bed.
