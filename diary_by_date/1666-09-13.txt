Up, and down to Tower wharfe; and there with Balty and
labourers from Deptford did get my goods housed well at home. So
down to Deptford again to fetch the rest, and there eat a bit of
dinner at the Globe, with the maister of the Bezan with me, while
the labourers went to dinner. Here I hear that this poor town doth
bury still of the plague seven or eight in a day. So to Sir G.
Carteret’s to work; and there did, to my great content, shipoff into
the Bezan all the rest of my goods, saving my pictures and fine
things, that I will bring home in wherrys when my house is fit to
receive them. And so home and unloaden them by carts and hands
before night, to my exceeding satisfaction; and so after supper to
bed in my house, the first time I have lain there; and lay with my
wife in my old closet upon the ground, and Balty and his wife in the
best chamber, upon the ground also.
