Up; and walked forth first to the Minerys to Brown’s, and
there with great pleasure saw and bespoke several Instruments —
and so to Cornhill to Mr. Cades, and there went up into his
warehouse to look for a map or two; and there finding great plenty
of good pictures, God forgive me how my mind run upon them.
And bought a little one for my wife’s closet presently, and
concluded presently of buying 10/ worth, upon condition he would
give me the buying of them. Now, it is true I did still within me
resolve to make the King one way or other pay for them, though |
saved it to him another way. Thence to the Coffee-house; and sat
long in good discourse with some gentlemen concerning the
Roman Empire. So home and find Mr. Hollyard there; and he
stayed and dined with us, we having a pheasant to dinner. He gone,
[all the afternoon with my wife to Cards. And God forgive me, to
see how the very discourse of plays, which I shall be at liberty to see
after New Year’s day next, doth set my mind upon them, that I
must be forced to stint myself very strictly before I begin, or else I
fear I shall spoil all. So to my office, writing letters, and then to read
and make an end of Rushworth; whichI did, and do say that it is a
book the best worth reading for a man of my condition, or any man
that hopes to come to any public condition in the world, that I do
know. So home to supper and to bed.
