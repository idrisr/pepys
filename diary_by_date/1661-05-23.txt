This day I went to my Lord, and about many other things at
Whitehall — and there made even my accounts with Mr. Sheply at
my Lord’s. And then with him and Mr. Moore and John Bowles to
the Renish winehouse, and there came Jonas Moore the Mathemati-
cian to us. And there he did by discourse make us fully believe that
England and France were once the same continent, by very good
arguments. And spoke very many things, not so much to prove the
Scripture false, as that the time therein is not well computed nor
understood. From thence home by water and there shifted myself
into my black silke sute (the first day I have put it on this year), and
135
so to my Lord Mayors by coach, where a great deal of Honourable
company — and great entertainment. At table I had very good
discourse with Mr. Ashmole, wherein he did assure me that froggs
and many other insects do often fall from the Sky ready-formed.
Dr. Bates’s singularity, in not rising up nor drink the King’s nor
other healths at the table, was very much observed. From thence we
all took coach and to our office. And there sat till it was late. And so
I home and to bed by day light. This day was kept a Holyday
through the towne. And it pleased me to see the little boys go up
and down in procession with their broomestaffes in their hands, as I
have myself long ago gone.!
