Lords day. With Sir W. Penn to the parish church, where we
are placed in the highest pew of all, where a stranger preached a dry
and tedious long sermon. Dined at home, and with my wife to
church again in the afternoon. Home again and walked in the
garden and on the leads till night; and so to supper and to bed.
