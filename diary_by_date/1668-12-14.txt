Up and by water to Whitehall to a Committee of Tanger;
where, among other things, a silly account ofa falling-out between
Norwood at Tanger and Mr. Bland the Mayor, who is fled to
Cales. His complaint is ill-worded; and the other’s defence, the
most ridiculous that ever I saw — and so everybody else that was
there thought it. But never did Isee so great an instance of the use of
grammar and knowledge how to tell a man’s tale as this day, Bland
having spoiled his business by ill-telling it; who had work to have
made himself notorious by his mastering Norwood his enemy, ifhe
had known how to have used. Thence calling Smith the Auditors
clerk at the Temple, I by the Exchange home and there looked over
my Tanger accounts with him; and so to dinner, and then set him
down again by a hackney, my coachman being this day about
breaking of my horses to the coach, they having never yet drawn.
