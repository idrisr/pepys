Lords day. This morning (we lying lately in the garret) I rose,
put on my suit with great skirts, having not lately worn any other
clothes but them. Went to Mr. Gunnings church at Exeter house,
where he made a very good sermon upon these words: That in the
fullness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman, &c., shewing
that by ‘‘made under the law,” is meant his circumcision, which is
solemnised this day. Dined at home in the garret, where my wife
dressed the remains ofa turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her
hand. I stayed at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts.
Then went with my wife to my father’s; and in going, observed the
great posts which the City hath set up at the Conduit in Fleet street.
Supped at my father’s, where in came Mrs. The[oph]. Turner and
Madam Morris and supped with us. After that, my wife and I went
home with them, and so to our own home.
