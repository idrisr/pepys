fullness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman, &c., shewing
that by “made under the law,” is meant his circumcision, which is
solemnised this day. Dined at home in the garret, where my wife
dressed the remains of a turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her
hand. I stayed at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts.
Then went with my wife to my father’s; and in going, observed the
great posts which the City hath set up at the Conduit in Fleet street.
Supped at my father’s, where in came Mrs. The[oph]. Turner and
Madam Morris and supped with us. After that, my wife and I went
home with them, and so to our own home.
