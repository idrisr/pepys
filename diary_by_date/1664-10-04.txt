Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. And this
morning Sir W. Pen went to Chatham to look after the ships now
going out thence — and perticularly that wherein the Duke and
himself goes. He took Sir G. Ascue with him, whom Ibelieve he
hath brought into play. At noon to the Change; and thence home,
where Ifind my aunt James and the two she-Joyces. They dined and
were merry with us. Thence after dinner to a play, to see The
Generall; which is so dull and so ill acted, that I think it is the worst I
ever saw or heard in all my days. I happened to sit next to Sir Ch.
Sidly; who Ifind a very witty man, and did at every line take notice
of the dullness of the poet and badness of the action, and that most
pertinently; which I was mightily taken with — and among others,
where by —Altemira’s command Clarimont the Generall is com-
manded to rescue his Rivall whom she loved, Lucidor, he after a
great deal of demurre breaks out — ‘‘Well — Ile save my Rivall and
make her confess. That I deserve, while he doth but possesse.”’
“Why, what! Pox!” says Sir Ch. Sydly, “‘would he have him have
more, or what is there more to be had of a woman then the
possessing her?” Thence, setting all them at home, Ihome with my
wife and Mercer, vexed at my losing my time and above 20s. in
money and neglecting my business to see so bada play. Tomorrow,
they told us, should be acted, or the day after, anew play called The
Parsons Dreame, acted all by women. So to my office and there did
business; and so home to supper and to bed.
