Up and to St. James’s, where long with Mr. Coventry, Povy
&c. in their Tanger accounts; but such the folly of that coxcomb
Povy that we could do little in it. And so parted for that time, and I
to walk with Creed and Vernaty in the physique garden in St. James
park, where I first saw Orange trees — and other fine trees. So to
Westminster hall and thence by water to the Temple; and so walked
to the Change and there find the Change full of news from Guiny;
some say the Dutch have sunk our ships and taken our fort and
others say we have done the same to them. But I find by our
merchants that something is done, but is yet a secret among them.
So home to dinner and then to the office; and at night with Capt.
Taylor, consulting how to get alittle money by letting him the Elias
to fetch masts from New England. So home to supper and to bed.
