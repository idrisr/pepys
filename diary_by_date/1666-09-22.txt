To my closet and had it new washed, and now my house is so
clean as I never saw it, or any other house in my life, and everything
in as good condition as ever before the fire; but with I believe about
20l cost one way or other, besides about 2o/ charge in removing my
goods; and do not find that I have lost anything but two little
pictures of shipping and sea, anda little gold frame for one of my
sea-cards. My glazier, endeed, is so full of work that I cannot get
him to come to perfect my house. In the afternoonIpaid for the two
lighters that carried my goods to Deptford, and they cost me 81.
