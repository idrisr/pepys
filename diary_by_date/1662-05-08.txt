Atthe office all the morning, doing business alone. And then to
the Wardrobe, where my Lady going out with the children to
dinner, I stayed not but returned home; and was overtaken in St
Paul’s churchyard by Sir G. Carteret in his coach, and so he carried
me to the Exchange, where I stayed awhile. He told me that the
Queene and the fleet were in Mounts bay on monday last — and that
the Queene endures her sickness pretty well. He also told me how
Sir John Lawson hath done some execution upon the Turkes in the
Straight, of which I am glad and told the news the first on the
Exchange. And was much fallowed by merchants to tell it. So
home and to dinner. And by and by to the office, and after the rest
gone (my Lady Albemarle being this day at dinner at Sir W.
Batten), Sir G. Carteret comes and he and I walked in the garden;
and among other discourse, he tells me that it is Mr. Coventry that
is to come to us as a Comissioner of the Navy. At which he is much
vexed, and cries out upon Sir W. Penn and threatens him highly;
and looking upon his lodgings, which are new enlarging, he in
passion cried “‘guarda mi spada! for by God, I may chance to keep
him in Ireland when he is there” — for Sir W. Penn is going thither
with my Lord Lieutenant, but it is my design to keep much in with
Sir G. and Ithink Ihave begun very well towards it. So to the office,
and was there late doing business; and so, with my head full of
business, I to bed.
