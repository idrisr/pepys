To my office, where busy; and anon, at 7 at night, I and my
wife and Sir W. Penn in his coach to Unthanke’s, my wife’s tailor’s,
for her to speak one word; and then we to my Lord Treasurer’s,
where I find the porter crying, and suspected it was that my Lord is
dead; and, poor Lord, we did find that he was dead just now; and
the crying of that fellow did so trouble me, that considering that I
was not likely to trouble him any more, nor have occasion to give
any more anything, I did give him 3s.; but it may be, poor man, he
hath lost a considerable hope by the death of this Lord, whose house
will be no more frequented as before — and perhaps I may never
come thither again about any business. There is a good man gone;
and I pray God that the Treasury may not be worse managed by the
hand or hands it shall now be put into; though, for certain, the
slowness (though he was of great integrity) of this man, and
remissness, have gone as far to undo the nation as anything else that
hath happened; and yet if I knew all the difficulties that he hath lain
under, and his instrument Sir Ph. Warwick, I might be brought to
another mind. Thence, we to Islington to the old house and there
eat and drank; and then, it being late and a pleasant evening, we
home; and there to my chamber and to bed.
