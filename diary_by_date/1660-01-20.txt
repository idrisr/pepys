Tomy office. At noon went by water with Mr. Maylard and
Hales to the Swan in Fishstreete at our colly-feast, where we were
very merry at our Jole of ling. And from thence, after a great and
good dinner of fish, Mr. Fauconbridge would go drink a cup of ale
at a place where Ihad like to have shit in a skimmer that lay over the
house of office. Thence, calling on Mr. Stephens and Wooton (with
whom I drank) about business of my Lord’s, I went to the Coffee
club, where there was nothing done but choosing of a committee
for orders. Thence to Westminster hall, where Mrs. Lane and the
rest of the maids have their white scarfs, all having been at the burial
of a young bookseller in the Hall. Thence to Mr. Sheply and took
him to my house and drank with him, in order to his going
tomorrow.! So parted, and I sat up late making up my accounts
before he go.
