And so home; and after dinner, to the King’s playhouse all
alone, and saw Loves Maistresse. Some pretty things and good
variety in it, but no or little fancy in it. Thence to the Duke of
Albemarle to give him account of my day’s works — where he
showed me letters from Sir G. Downing, of four days’ date, that the
Duch are come out and joyned — well-manned and resolved to
490
board our best ships; and fight for certain they will. Thence to the
Swan at Herberts, and there the company of Saraha
little while; and
so away and called at the Harp and Ball, where the maid, Mary, is
very formosa; but Lord, to see in what readiness I am, upon the
expiring of my vowes this day, to begin to run into all my pleasures
and neglect of business. Thence home; and being sleepy, to bed.
