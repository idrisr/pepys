Early came Mr. Vanly to me for his half-year’s rent, which I
had not in the house, but took his man to my office and there paid
him. Then I went down into the Hall and to Will’s, where Hawly
brought a piece of his Cheshire cheese, and we were merry with it.
Then into the Hall again, where I met with the Clerk and
quartermaster of my Lord’s troop, and took them to the Swan and
gave them their morning’s draught, they being just come to town.
Mr. Jenkings showed me two bills of exchange for money to
receive upon my Lord’s and my pay. It snowed hard all this
morning and was very cold, and my nose was much swelled with
cold. Strange, the difference of men’s talk: some say that Lambert
must of necessity yield up; others, that he is very strong, and that
the Fifth-monarchy men will stick to him if he declares for a free
Parliament. I heard that the Parliament spent this day in fast and
prayer; and that my Lord Lambert his forces were all forsaking him
and that he was left with only so horse and that he did now declare
for the Parliament himself. Home and so to bed; but much troubled
with my nose, which was much swelled.
