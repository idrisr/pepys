Upto the office very betimes to draw up a letter for the Duke
of Yorke, relating to him the badness of our condition in this office
for want of money. That being in good time done, we met at the
office and there sat all the morning. Atnoon home, where] find my
wife troubled still at my checking her last night in the coach in her
long stories out of Grand Cyrus, which she would tell, though
nothing to the purpose nor in any good manner. This she took
unkindly, and I think I was to blame endeed — but she doth find,
with reason, that in the company of Pierce — Knipp — or other
women that I love, I do not value her, or mind her as I ought.
However, very good friends by and by, and to dinner, and after
dinner up to the putting our dining-room in order, which will be
clean again anon, but not as it is to be, because of the pictures, which
are not come home. To the office and did much business; in the
evening to Westminster and Whitehall about business, and among
other things, met Sir G. Downing on Whitehall bridge and there
walked half an hour, talking of the success of the late new act; and
616
endeed it is very much that that hath stood really in the room of
800000! now since Christmas, being itself but 1250000]. And so Ido
really take it to be a very considerable thing done by him, for the
beginning, end, and every part of it is to be imputed to him. So
home by water, and there hard, till 12 at night, at work, finishing
the great letter to the Duke of York against tomorrow morning;
and so home to bed. This day came home again my girle Susan, her
sickness proving an ague, and she had a fit as soon almost as she
came home. The fleet is not yet gone from the Nore. The plague
encreases in many places, and is 53 this week with us.
