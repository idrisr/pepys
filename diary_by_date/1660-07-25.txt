This morning my Lord took leave of the House of Commons
— and had the thanks of the House for his great services to his
country. In the afternoon (but this is a mistake, for it was yesterday
in the afternoon) Monsieur Limpertinent and I met, and I took him
to the Sun and drank with him; and in the evening going away, we
met his mother and sisters and father coming downstairs from the
Gatehouse, where they lodge. Where I did the first time salute them
all; and very pretty Madam Frances is endeed. Home and to bed.
