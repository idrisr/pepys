Lords day. Lay long in bed today with my wife, merry and
pleasant. And then rose and settled my accounts with my wife for
housekeeping, and do see that my kitchen, besides wine, fire,
candle, soap, and many other things, comes to about 30s. a week or
a little over. To church, where Mr. Mills made a lazy sermon; so
home to dinner, where my brother.Tom dined with me. Andso my
wife and I to church again in the afternoon. And that done, I walked
to the Wardrobe and spent my time with Mr. Creede and Mr.
Moore, talking about business; so up to supper with my Lady —
who tells me with much trouble that my Lady Castlemayne is still
as great with the King and that the King comes often to her as ever
he did. At which, God forgive me, I am well pleased. It begun to
rain, and so I borrowed a hat and cloak of Mr. Moore and walked
home, where Ifound Capt. Ferrer with my wife; and after spending
a matter of an hour with him, he went home and we all to bed.
