ToMr. Blands, where Mr. Povey, Gauden andI were invited
to dinner — which we had very finely, and great plenty but for
drink, though many and good; I drunk nothing but small beer and
water, which I drunk so much that I wish it may not do me hurt.
They have a kinswoman they call daughter in the house, a short,
ugly, red-haired slut that plays upon the virginalls and sings, but
after such a country manner, I was weary of it but yet could not but
commend it. So by and by after dinner comes Monsieur Gotier,
who is beginning to teach her; but Lord, what a drolle fellow itis, to
make her hold open her mouth and telling this and that so drolly,
would make a man burst; but himself I perceive sings very well.
