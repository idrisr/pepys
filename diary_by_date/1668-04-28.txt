Up betimes and to Sir W. Coventry’s by water, but lost my
labour; so through the park to Whitehall, and thence to my Lord
Crews to advise again with him about my Lord Sandwich; and so to
the office, where till noon; and then I by coach to Westminster hall,
and there do understand that the business of religion and the act
against Conventicles have so taken them up all this morning, and
doth still, that my Lord Sandwiches business is not like to come on
today; which I am heartily glad of. This law against Conventicles is
very severe; but Creed, whom I met here, doth tell me that it being
moved that Papists meetings might be included, the House was
divided upon it and it was carried in the negative; which will give
great disgust to the people I doubt. Thence with Creed to Hercules
Pillars by the Temple again, and there dined, he andI all alone; and
thence to the King’s House and there did see Love in a maze; wherein
very good mirth of Lacy the clown and Wintersell the country-
knight, his maister. Thence to the New Exchange to pay a debt of
my wife’s there, and so home; and there to the office and walk in the
garden in the dark to ease my eyes; andso home to supper and to bed.
