Going to Whitehall I had pleasant rancontre of a lady in
mourning, that by the little light I had seemed handsome; I passing
by her, I did observe she looked back again and again upon me, I
suffering her to go before, and it being now duske. I observed she
went into the little passage towards the privy water-gate, and |
fallowed but missed her; but coming back again, I observed she
returned and went to go out of the Court. I fallowed her, and took
occasion in the new passage now built, where the walke is to be, to
take her by the hand to lead her through; which she willingly
accepted, and Iled her to the great gate and there left her, she telling
me of her own accord that she was going as far as Charing cross; but
my boy was at the gate, and so yo durst not go out con her — which
vexed me; and my mind (God forgive me) did run aprés her todo
the night, though I have reason to thank God, and so I do now, that
I was not tempted to go further.
