This evening I observed my wife mighty dull; and I myself
was not mighty fond, because of some hard words she did give me
at noon, out of a jealousy at my being abroad this morning; when,
God knows, it was upon the business of the office unexpectedly;
but I to bed, not thinking but she would come after me; but waking
by and by out of slumber, which I usually fall into presently after
my coming into the bed, Ifound she did not prepare to come to bed,
but got fresh candles and more wood for her fire, it being mighty
cold too. At this being troubled, I after a while prayed her to come
to bed, all my people being gone to bed; so after an hour or two, she
silent, and I now and then praying her to come to bed, she fell out
into a fury, that I was a rogue and false to her; but yet I could
978
perceive that she was to seek what to say; only, she invented, I
believe, a business that I was seen in a hackney coach with the
glasses up with Deb, but could not tell the time, nor was sure I was
he. Idid, as Imight truly, deny it, and was mightily troubled; but all
would not serve. At last, about one a-clock, she came to my side of
the bed and drow my curtaine open, and with the tongs, red hot at
the ends, made as if she did design to pinch me with them; at which
in dismay I rose up, and with a few words she laid them down and
did by little and little, very sillily, let all the discourse fall; and about
2, but with much seeming difficulty, came to bed and there lay well
all night, and long in bed talking together with much pleasure; it
being, I know, nothing but her doubt of my going out yesterday
without telling her of my going which did vex her, poor wretch,
last night: and I cannot blame her jealousy, though it doth vex me to
the heart.
