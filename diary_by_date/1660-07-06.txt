Inthe morning with my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the
Council for us to act. Sir G. Carteret andI to the Treasurer’s Office,
60
where he set some things in order there. And so home, calling upon
Sir Geffery Palmer, who did give me advice about my patent which
put me to some doubt to know what to do — Barlow being alife.
Homeward called at Mr. Pims about getting me a coat of velvett,
and he took me to the Half Moone, and there the house so full that
we stayed above half an hour before we could get anything. So to
my Lord’s, where in the dark W. Howe andI did sing Extemporys,
and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a treble pretty
well. So home and to bed.
