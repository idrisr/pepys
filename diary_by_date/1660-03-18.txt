This day was very rainy all day. I rose early and went to the
Barber’s (Jervas) in the Palace yard and was trimmed* by him; and
afterward drank with him a cup or two ofale, and did begin to hire
his man to go with me to sea. Then to my Lord’s lodging, where I
found Capt. Williamson and gave him his commission to be
Captain of the Harpe and he gave me a piece of gold and 20s. in
silver. So to my own house, where I stayed a while and then to
dinner with Mr. Sheply at my Lord’s lodgings. After that to Mr.
Messum’s, where he made a very gallant sermon upon “Pray for
the life of the King, and the King’s son” (Esra 6. 10).
