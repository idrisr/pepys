Up betimes and to my office. Anon met to pass Mr. Pitts (Sir
J. Lawson’s Secretary and Deputy Treasurer) accounts for the
voyage last to the Streights — wherein the demands are strangely
irregular; and
I dare not oppose it alone, for making an enemy, and
both no good but only bring a review upon my Lord Sandwiches;
but God knows, it troubles my heart to see it and to see the
Comptroller, whose duty it is, to make no more matter of it. At
noon home for an hour to dinner, and so to the office, public and
private, till late at night; so home to supper and bed with my father.
