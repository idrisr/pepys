About 8 a-clock in the morning, the Lieutenant came to me to
know whether I would eat a dish of Mackrell, newly-ketched this
morning, for my breakfast — which the Captain and we did in the
coach. All yesterday and today I have a great deal of pain in making
water and in my back, which made me afeared. But it proved
nothing but cold which I took yesterday night. All this morning
making up my accounts, in which I counted that I have made
myself now worth about 80/, at which my heart was glad and
blessed God. In the afternoon, Mr. Sheply told me how my Lord
had put me down for 70 Gilders among the money which was given
to my Lord’s servants, which my heart did much rejoice at.
