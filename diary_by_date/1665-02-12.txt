Lords day. Up, and to church to St. Lawrence to hear Dr.
Wilkins the great scholar, for curiosity, I having never heard him.
But was not satisfied with him at all. Only, a gentleman sat in the
pew I by chance sat in, that sang most excellently, and afterward I
found by his face that he hath been a paul’s scholler, but know not
his name — and I was also well pleased with the church, it being a
very fine church. So home to dinner, and then to my office all the
afternoon, doing of business; and in the evening comes Mr. Hill
(but no Andrews) and we spent the evening very finely, singing,
supping, and discoursing. Then to prayers and to bed.
