Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and at
noon I to the Change and there met with Mr. Cutler the merchant,
who would needs have me home to his house by the Dutch church;
and there in an old but good house with his wife and mother, a
couple of plain old women, I dined; a good plain dinner, and his
discourse after dinner with me upon matters of the navy victuall-
ing, very good and worth my hearing. And so home to my office in
the afternoon, with my mind full of business; and there at it late,
and so home to supper to my poor wife and to bed — myself being in
326
a little pain in one of my testicles, by a stroke I did give it in pulling
up my breeches yesterday over-eagerly. The plague, it seems,
grows more and more at Amsterdam. And we are going upon
making of all ships coming from thence and Hambrough, or any
other infected places, to perform their Quarantine (for 30 days as Sir
Rd. Browne expressed it in the order of the Council, contrary to the
import of the word; though in the general acceptation, it signifies
now the thing, not the time spent in doing it) in Holehaven ~a thing
never done by us before.
