Up before 4 a-clock, and so to my lute an hour and more and
then by water, drinking my morning draught alone in an alehouse
in Thames streete, to the Temple; and there, after a little discourse
with my cousin Roger about some business, away by water to St:
James and there an hour’s private discourse with Mr. Coventry. We
did talk highly of Sir W. Batten’s corruption, which Mr. Coventry
did very kindly say that it might be only his heaviness and
unaptness for business that he doth things without advice and
rashly and to gratify people that do eat and drink and play with him.
And that now and then he observes that he signs bills only in anger
and fury, to be rid of them. From that, we discoursed of the evil of
289
putting out men of experience in business, as the Chancellor; and
from that, to speak of the condition of the King’s party at present;
who, as the papists, though otherwise fine persons, yet being by
law kept for these four score years out ofimployment, they are now
wholly uncapable of business; and so the Cavalers for 20 years —
who, says he, for the most part have either given themselfs over to
look after country and family business, and those the best of them,
and the rest to debauchery &c.
