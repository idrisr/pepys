Upandto the Tower to W. Coventry, and there walked with
him alone on the Stone Walk till company came to him; and there
about the business of the Navy discoursed with him, and about my
Lord Chancellor and Treasurer; that they were against the war at
first— declaring, as wise men and statesmen at first to the King, that
they thought it fit to have a war with them at some time or other,
but that it ought not to be till we found the Crowns of Spain and
France together by the eares; the want of which did ruin our Warr.
But then he told me, that a great deal before the Warr, my Lord
Chancellor did speak of a Warr with some heat, as a thing to be
desired, and did it upon a belief that he could with his speeches
make the Parliament give what money he pleased, and do what he
would or wauld make the King desire; but he found himself soon
deceived of that, the Parliament having a long time before his
removal been cloyed with his speeches and good words — and were
come to hate him. Sir W. Coventry did tell me it, as the wisest thing
that ever was said to the King by any statesman of his time, and it
was by my Lord Treasurer that is dead, whomIfind he takes for a
very great statesman; that when the King did show himself forward
999.
for passing the Act of Indemnity, he did advise the King that he
would hold his hand in doing it, till he had got his power restored
that had been diminished by the late times, and his revenue settled
in such a manner as he might depend on himself, without resting
upon Parliaments, and then pass it. But my Lord Chancellor, who
thought he could have the command of Parliaments for ever,
because for the King’s sake they were awhile willing to grant all the
King desire[d], did press for its being done; and so it was, and the
King from that time able to do nothing with the Parliament almost.
Thence to the office, where sat all the forenoon; and then home to
dinner and so to the office, where late busy; and so home, mightily
pleased with the news brought me tonight, that the King and the
Duke of York are come back this afternoon to town, and no sooner
come but a Warrant was sent to the Tower for the releasing Sir W.
Coventry.
