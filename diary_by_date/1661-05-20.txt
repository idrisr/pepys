Atnoon Mr. Creed came to me; and he and Ito the Exchange,
and so to an ordinary to dinner; and after dinner to the Miter and
there sat drinking while it rained very much. Then to the office,
whereIfind Sir Wms both, choosing of Maisters for the new fleet of
ships that is ordered to be set forth. And Pen seeming to be in an
ugly humour, not willing to gratify one that I mentioned to be put
in, did vex me. We sat late, and so home. Mr. Moore came to me
when I was going to bed, and sat with me a good while, talking
about my Lord’s business and our own. And so good-night.
