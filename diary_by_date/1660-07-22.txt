Lords day. All the last night it had rained hard. I went out and
looked into several churches; and so to my uncle Fenners, whither
my wife was got before me; and we, my father and mother and all
the Joyces and my aunt Bell, whom I had not seen many a year
before. After dinner, I to Whitehall (my wife to church with K.
Joyce), where I found my Lord at home and walked in the garden
with him, he showing me all the respect that can be. I left him — and
went to walk in the park, where great endeavouring to get into the
Inward park, but could not. And one man was basted by the keeper
for carrying some people over on his back through the water.
Afterward to my Lord’s, where I stayed and drank with Mr.
Sheply; and having first sent to get a pair of oares, it was the first
65
time that ever I went by water on the Lord’s day. Home, and at
night had a chapter read; and I read prayers out of the Common
Prayer book, the first time that ever I read prayers in this house. So
to bed.
