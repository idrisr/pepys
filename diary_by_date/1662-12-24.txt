To my Lord Crew’s and dined alone with him; and after
dinner, much discourse about matters. Upon the whole, I under-
stand there are great factions at Court; and something he said that
did imply a difference like to be between the King and the Duke in
case the Queene should not be with child —I understand, about this
bastard.’ He says also that some great man will be aimed at when
the Parliament comes to sit again; I understand, the Chancellor.
And that there is a bill will be brought in, that none that have been in
armes for the Parliament shall be capable of office. And that the
Court are weary of my Lord Albemarle and Chamberlin.* He
wishes that my Lord Sandwich had some good occasion to be
abroad this summer which is coming on. And that my Lord
Hinchingbrooke were well married, and Sydny’ had some place at
Court. He pities the poor Ministers that are put out, to whom he
says the King is beholden for his coming in; and that if any such
thing had been foreseen, he had never come in. After this, and much
other discourse of the sea and breeding young gentlemen to the sea,
Iwent away. This evening Mr. Gauden sent me, against Christmas,
a great Chine of beefe and three dozen of Toungs. I did give $s. to
the man that brought it and half-crown to the porters. This day
also, the parish Clerke brought the general bill of Mortality, which
cost me half-Crowne more.
