To the Plasterers and there saw the figure of my face taken
from the Mold; and it is most admirably like, and I will have
another made before I take it away; and therefore I away and to the
Temple, and thence to my cousin Turner’s; where, having the last
night been told by her that she had drawn me for her Valentine, I
did this day call at the New Exchange and bought her a pair of green
silk stockings and garters and shoe-strings, and two pair ofJessimy-
gloves, all coming to about 28s. — and did give them her this noon.
At the Change, I did at my bookseller’s shop accidentally fall into
talk with Sir Sam. Tuke about Trees and Mr. Evelings garden; and I
do find him, I think, a little conceited, but a man of very fine
discourse as any I ever heard almost — which I was mighty glad of. I
dined at my cousin Turner’s, and after dinner took up my cousin
Turner, and to my cousin Roger’s lodgings and there find him
pretty well again, and his wife mighty kind and merry and did make
mighty much of us; and I believe he is married to a very good
woman. Here was also Bab and Betty,’ who have not their clothes
yet, and therefore cannot go out; otherwise I would have had them
abroad tomorrow; but the poor girls mighty kind to us, and we
must show them kindness also.
