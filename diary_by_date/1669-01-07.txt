Up and to the office, where busy all the morning; and then at
noon home to dinner; and thence, my wife and I to the King’s
playhouse and there saw The Island princesse, the first time Iever saw
it; and it is a pretty good play, many good things being in it— and a
good scene ofatown on fire. We sat in an upper box, andthat jade
Nell came and sat in the next box, a bold merry slut, who lay
laughing there upon people, and with a comrade of hers of the
Duke’s House that came in to see the play. Thence home and to the
office to do some business; and so home to supper and to bed.
g. Up, and at the office all the morning; and at noon my Lord
Brouncker, Mr. Wren, Jos. Williamson, and Capt. Cocke dined
with me. And being newly sat down, comes in, by an invitation of
Williamson’s, the Lieutenant of the Tower — and he brings in with
him young Mr. Whore, whose father, of the Tower, I know. And
here I had a neat dinner, and all in so good manner and fashion and
with so good company and everything to my mind, as I never had
more in my life — the company being to my heart’s content, and
they all well pleased. So continued looking over my books and
closet till the evening, and soI to the office and did a good deal of
business; and so home to supper and to bed, with my mind mightily
pleased with this day’s management, as oneofthe days of my life of
fullest content.
