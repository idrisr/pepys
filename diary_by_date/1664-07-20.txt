This evening being moonshine, I playedalittle late upon my
flagelette in the garden. But being at Westminster hall, I met with
great news: that Mrs. Lane is married to one Martin, one that serves
Capt. Marsh. She is gone abroad with him today, very fine. I must
have a bout with her very shortly, to see how she finds marriage.
