Up and by water to Whitehall, where we did much business
before the Duke of York; which being done, Iaway home by water
again, and there to my office till noon, busy. At noon home, and
Goodgroome dined with us — who teaches my wife to sing. After
dinner I did give him my song, Beauty retire, which he hath often
desired of me; and without flattery, I think is a very good song. He
gone, I to the office and there late very busy, doing much business;
and then home to supper and talk; and then scold with my wife for
not reckoning well the times that her music masters have been with
her, but setting down more then J am sure, and did convince her,
they had been with her; and in an ill humour of anger with her, to
bed.
