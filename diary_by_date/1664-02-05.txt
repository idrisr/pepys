Up; and down by water, a brave morning, to Woolwich and
there spent an hour or two to good purpose; and so walked to
Greenwich and thence to Deptford, where I find (with Sir W.
Batten upon the survey) Sir
J.Mennes, Sir W. Penn and my Lady
Batten come down and going to dinner. I dined with them, and so
after dinner by water home, all the way going and coming reading
Faber fortune, which I can never read too often. At home a while
with my wife; and so to my office, where till 8 a-clock, and then
home to look after some Brampton papers and perticularly those of
my uncles accounts as Generall-Receiver of the county for the year
1647 of our Monthly Assessement; which, contrary to my
expectation, Ifound in such good order and so thoroughly that I did
349
not expect nor could have thought; and that being done, having
seen discharges for every farthing of money he received, I went to
bed late with great quiet.
