Up, and to finish my Journall, which I had not sense enough
the last night to make an end of — and thence to the office, where
very busy all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and presently
with my wife out to Hales’s, where I am still infinitely pleased with
my wife’s picture. I paid him 141 for it, and 25s. for the frame, and I
think it not a whit too dear for so good a picture. It is not yet quite
finished and dry, so as to be fit to bring home yet. This day I begun
to sit, and he will make me, Ithink, a very fine picture. He promises
it shall be as good as my wife’s, andI sit to have it full of shadows,
and do almost break my neck looking over my shoulder to make
the posture for him to work by. Thence home and to the office; and
so home, having a great cold, and so my wife and Mrs. Barbary
have very great ones — we are at a loss how we all come by it
together. So to bed, drinking butter-ale. This day my W. Hewers
comes from Portsmouth —and gives me an instance of another piece
of knaveries of Sir W. Penn, who wrote to Comissioner Middleton
that it was my negligence the other day he was not acquainted, as
the Board directed, with our clerks coming down to the pay. But I
need no new arguments to teach me that he is a false rogue to me,
and all the world besides.
