To the office, where upon Mr. Kinaston’s coming to me
about some business of Coll. Norwood’s, I sent my boy' home for
some papers; where, he staying longer then I would have him and
being vexed at the business and to be kept from my fellows in the
office longer then was fit, I became angry and boxed my boy when
he came, that I do hurt my Thumb so much, that I was not able to
stir all the day after and in great pain. At noon to dinner, and then to
the office again late, and so to supper and to bed.
