Lords day. Being dressed in my velvet coat and plain Cravatt,
took a hackney coach provided ready for me by 8 a-clock; and so to
my Lord Brouncker with all my papers. And there took his coach
with four horses and away towards Hampton Court, havinga great
deal of good discourse with him. At the Wicke found Sir
J.Mennes
and Sir W. Batten at a lodging provided for us by our Messenger,
and there a good dinner ready. After dinner took coach, and to
Court, where we find the King and Duke and Lords all in council;
so we walked up and down -there being none of the ladies come,
and so much the more business I hope will be done. The Council
being up, out comes the King, and I kissed his hand and he grasped
me very kindly by the hand. The Duke also, I kissed his; and he
mighty kind, and Sir W. Coventry. After changing a few words
with Sir W. Coventry, who assures me ofhis respect and love to me
and his concernment for my health in all this sickness —I went down
into one of the Courts and there met the King and Duke; and the
Duke called me to him — and the King came to me of himself and
told me: “Mr. Pepys,” says he, “I do give you thanks for your good
service all this year, and I assure you I am very sensibleofit.” And
the Duke of Yorke did tell me with pleasure that he had read over
S77
my discourse about Pursers and would have it ordered in my way.
We took boat and by water to Kingstone; and so to our Lodgeings,
where a good supper and merry; only, I sleepy, and therefore after
supper Islunk away from the rest to bed, and lay very well and slept
soundly — my mind being in a great delirium, between joy for what
the King and Duke have said to me and Sir W. Coventry — and
trouble for my Lord Sandwiches concernments and how hard it
will be for me to preserve myself from feeling thereof.
