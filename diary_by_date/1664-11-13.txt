Lords day. The morning to church, where mighty sport to
hear our Clerk sing out of tune, though his master sits by him that
begins and keeps the tune aloud for the parish. Dined at home very
well. And spent all the afternoon with my wife within doors — and
getting a speech out of Hamlett, ‘“To bee or not to bee,”’ without
book. In the evening, to sing psalms; and in came Mr. Hill to see
me, and then he and I and the boy finely to sing; and so anon broke
up after much pleasure. He gone, I to supper and so to prayers and
to bed.
