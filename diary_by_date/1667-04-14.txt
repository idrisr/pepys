Lords day. Up, and to read a
little in my new History of Turky;
and so with my wife to church, and then home to dinner, where is
little Michell and my pretty Betty and also Mercer; and very merry,
a good dinnerofroast beef. After dinner, I away to take water at the
Tower; and thence to Westminster, where Mrs. Martin was not at
home; so to Whitehall and there walked up and down; and among
other things, visited Sir G. Carteret, and much talk with him; who
is discontented, as he hath reason, to see how things are like to come
all to naught. And it is very much that this resolution of having of
country-Admirals should not come to his eares till I told it him the
other day, so that I doubt who manages things. From him to
Margaret Church, and there spied Martin and home with her, who
had those, so could have ninguno placer; but fell out to see her
expensefulness, having bought Turkey work chairs &c; by and by
away home, and there took out my wife and the two Mercers and
two of ur maids, Barker and Jane, and over the water to the Jamaica
house, where I never was before; and there the girls did run for
wagers over the bowling-green. And there with much pleasure,
spent little, and so home; and they home, and I read with
satisfaction in my book of Turky and so to bed.
