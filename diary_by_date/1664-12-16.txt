Upand by water to Deptford, thinking to have met la femme
de Bagwell, but failed; and having done some business at the yard, I
back again, it being a fine fresh morning to walk. Back again, Mr.
450
Wayth walking with me to Halfway house, talking about Mr.
Castles fine knees lately delivered in - in which I am well informed
that they are not as they should be to make them knees. And I hope
shall make good use of it to the King’s service. Thence home; and
having dressed myself, to the Change and thence home to dinner.
And so abroad by coach with my wife, and bought a looking-glass
by the Old Exchange which costs me 5/ $s. — and 6s. for the hooks.
A very fair glass.
