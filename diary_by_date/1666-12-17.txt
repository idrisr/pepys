nothing but Musique with me this morning, to my great content;
and the more to see that God Almighty hath put me into condition
to bear the charge of all this. So out to the Change I, and dida little
business; and then home, where they two musicians and Mr.
Cooke came to see me-and Mercer, to go along with my wife this
afternoon to a play. To dinner, and then our company all broke up,
and I to my chamber to do several things — among other things, to
write a letter to my Lord Sandwich, it being one of the burdens
upon my mind that I have not writ to him since he went into Spain.
But now I do intend to give him abrief account of our whole year’s
action sirice he went, which will make amends. My wife well home
in the evening from the play; which I was glad of, it being cold and
dark, and she having her necklace of pearl on, and none but Mercer
with her. Spent the evening in fitting my books, to have the
number set upon each in order to my having an Alphabet of my
whole, which will be of great ease to me. After supper, to bed.
