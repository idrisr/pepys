At the office all the morning, where we had a Deputacion*
from the Duke in his absence (he being gone to Portsmouth) for us
to have the whole dispose and ordering of the fleet.* In the
afternoon, about business up and down; and at night to visit Sir R.
Slingsby, who is fallen sick of this new disease, an ague and fever.
So home after visiting my aunt Wight and Mrs. Norbury (who
continues still a very pleasant lady); and to supper and so to bed.
1. Author of Advice to a Son (1658).
