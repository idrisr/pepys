All the morning at home putting papers in order. Dined at
home. And then out to the Red bull (where I have not been since
plays came up again), where I was led by a seaman that knew me,
that is here as a servant, up to the tireing-room; where strange the
confusion and disorder that there is among them in fitting
themselfs; especially here, where the clothes are very poore and the
actors but common fellows. At last into the pitt, where Ithink there
was not above ten more then myself, and not 100 in the whole
house — and the play (which is called All’s lost by Lust) poorly done-
and with so much disorder; among others, that in the Musique-
room, the boy that was to sing a song not singing it right, his master
fell about his eares and beat him so, that put the whole house into an
uprore. Thence homewards and at the Miter met my uncle Wight,
and with him Lieut.-Coll. Baron, who told us how Crofton, the
great presbyterian minister that hath lately preached so highly
against Bishops, is clapped up this day into the tower — which doth
please some and displease others exceedingly. Home and to bed.
