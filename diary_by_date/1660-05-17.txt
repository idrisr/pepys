Up early to write down my last two days observations.
Before dinner, Mr. Edward! and I, W. Howe, Pim and my boy, to
Skeveling, where we took coach, and so to The Hague, where
walking, intending to find one that might show us the King
incognito, I met with Capt. Whittington and Dr. Cade, a merry
mad parson of the King’s. And they two after dinner got the child
and me (the others not being able to crowd in) to see the King, who

kissed the child very affectionately. There we kissed his and the
Duke of Yorkes and the Princesse Royalls hands. The King seems
to be a very sober man; and a very splendid Court he hath in the
number of persons of Quality that are about him; English, very rich
in habit. From the King to the Lord Chancellor who did lie bed-rid
of the goute: he spoke very merrily to the child and me. After that,
to see the Queen of Bohemia, who used us very respectfully. Her
hand we all kissed. She seems a very debonaire, but plain lady.
After that, we went to see a house of the Princesse Dowagers in a
parke about half a mile or a mile from The Hague, where there is
one the most beautiful room[s] for pictures in the whole world. She
had her own picture upon the top, with this word, dedicating it to
the memory of her husband:
Incomparabili marito inconsolabilis vidua.
Here I met with Mr. Woodcock of Cambrige, Mr Hardye and
another. And Mr. Woodcock beginning, we had two or three fine
songs, he and I and W. Howe, to the Echo, which was very
pleasant, and the more because in a haven of pleasure and in a
strange country -- that I never was taken up more with a sense of
pleasure in my life. After that we parted and back to The Hague and
took a tour or two about the Forehault, where the ladies in the
evening do as our ladies do in Hideparke. But for my life I could not
find one handsome; but their coaches very rich and themselfs so
too.
