But betimes up this morning; and getting ready, we by coach
403
to Holborne, where at 9 a-clock they set out, and Iand my man Will
on horse by her to Barnett, a very pleasant day, and there dined
with her company, which was very good — a pretty gentlewoman
with her that goes but to Huntington, and a neighbour to us in
town. Here we stayed two hours and then parted for altogether —
and my poor wife I shall soon want, Iam sure. Thence I and Will to
see the Wells, half a mile off; and there I drunk three glasses and
went and walked, and came back and drunk two more. The woman
would have had me drunk three more; but I could not, my belly
being full — but this wrought very well; and so we rode home round
by Kingsland, Hackney, and Mile end, till we were quite weary —
and my water working at least seven or eight times upon the road,
which pleased me well. And so home, weary; and not being very
well, I betimes to bed. And there fell into a most mighty sweat in
the night, about 11 a-clock; and there, knowing what money Ihave
in the house and hearing a noise, I begin to sweat worse and worse,
till I melted almost to water. I rung, and could not in half an hour
make either of the wenches hear me; and this made me fear the
more, lest they might be gag’d; and then I begin to think that there
was some design in a stone being flung at the window over our
stairs this evening, by which the thiefes meant to try what looking
there would [be] after them and know our company. These
thoughts and fears Ihad, and do hence apprehend the fears of all rich
men that are covetous and have much money by them. Atlast Jane
rose and then I understand it was only the dog wants a lodging and
so made a noyse. So to bed, but hardly slept; at last did, and so till
morning.
