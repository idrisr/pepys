At noon met my wife at the Wardrobe — and there dined,
where we find Capt. Country (my little Captain that I loved, who
carried me to the Sound)' come with some Grapes and Millons
from my Lord at Lisbone —the first that ever I saw any. And my
wife and I eat some, and took some home. But the grapes are rare
things. Here we stayed; and in the afternoon comes Mr. Edw.
Mountagu to talk with my Lady and me about the provisions fit to
be bought and sent to my Lord along with him. And told us that we
need not trouble ourselfs how to buy them, for the King would pay
for all, and that he would take care to get them — which put my Lady
and me into a great deal of ease of mind. Here we stayed and supped
too; and after my wife had put up some of the grapes in a basket for
1. In 1659 Pepys had sailed with letters to Mountagu’s fleet in the Baltic.

to be sent to the King, we took coach and home — where we find a
hampire of Millons sent to me also.
