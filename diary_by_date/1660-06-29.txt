This day or two mymaid Jane hath been lame, that we cannot
tell what to do for want of her. Up and to Whitehall, where Igot my
warrant from the Duke to be Clerk of the Acts. Meeting Mr.
Townsend in the palace [yard] — he and I and another or two went
and dined at the Leg there. Then to Whitehall, where I was told by
Mr. Huchinson at the Admiralty that Mr. Barlow my Predecessor,
Clerk of the Acts, is yet alive and coming up to town to look after
his place — which made my heart sadalittle. At night told my Lord
thereof and he bade me to get possession of my patent; and he
would do all that could be done to keep him out. This night my
Lord and I looked over the list of the Captains, and marked some
that my Lord hath a mind to have put out. Home and to bed. Our
wench very lame, abed these two days.
