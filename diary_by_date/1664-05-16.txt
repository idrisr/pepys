Forced to rise because of going to the Duke to St. James,
where we did our usual business; and thence by invitation to Mr.
Pierce’s the surgeon, where I saw his wife, whom I had not seen in
many months before. She holds her complexion still; but in
everything else, even in this her new house and the best rooms in it
and her closet, which her husband with some vainglory took me to
show me, she continues the veriest slattern that ever I knew in my
life. By and by we to see an experiment of killing a dog by letting
opium into his hind leg. He and Dr. Clerke did fail mightily in
hitting the vein, and in effect did not do the business after many
trials; but with the little they got in, the dog did presently fall asleep
and so lay till [hJe cut him up. Anda little dog also, which they put it
down his throate; he also staggered first, and then fell asleep and so
continued; whether he recovered or no after I was gone, I know
not — but it is a strange and sudden effect.
