Up, and discoursing with my wife, who is resolved to go to
London for good and all this day, we did agree upon giving Mr.
Sheldon tol, and Mrs. Barb. two pieces. And so I left her to go
down thither to fetch away the rest of the things and pay him the
money; and soI to the office, where very busy, setting Mr. Poynter
to write out my last night’s work; which pleases me this day, but
yet it is pretty to reflect how much I am out of countenance with
what Ihad done up[on] Gibsons discourse with me, for fear Ishould
have done it sillily. But Poynter likes them, and Mr. Hater also; but
yet I am afeared lest they should do it outofflattery, so conscious I
am of my ignorance.
