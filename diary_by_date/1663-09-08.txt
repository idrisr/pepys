Upandto my vyall a while; and then to my office, one Phillips
having brought me a draught of the Katharin Yacht, prettily well
done for the common way of doing it. At the office all the morning,
making up our last half-year’s account to my Lord Treasurer,
which comes to 160000! or thereabouts, the proper expense of this
half-year; only, with an addition of 130001 for the threepences' due
of the last account to the Treasurer for his disbursements and 1 100l
for this half-year’s; so that in three years and half, his threepences
come to 14100/. Dined at home with my wife, it being washing day;
we hada good pie, baked of
a leg of mutton. And then to my office
and then abroad; and among other places, to Moxon’s and there
bought a payre of Globes, cost me 3/ 10s. — with which I am well
pleased, Ibuying them principally for my wife, who hath a mind to
understand them — andI shall take pleasure to teach her. But here I
saw his great Window in his dining-room, where there is the two
Terrestriell Hemispheres, so painted as I never saw in my life, and
nobly done and to good purpose — done by his own hand. Thence
home to my office and there at business late. And then to supper,
home and to bed— my people sitting up longer then ordinary before
they had done their washing.
