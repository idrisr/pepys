Lords day. Having taken one of Mr. Holliards pills last night,
it brought a stool or two this morning; and so I forebore going to
church this morning, but stayed at home, looking over my papers
about T. Trices business;' and so at noon dined, and my wife
telling me that there was a pretty lady come to church with Pegg
Pen today,
I against my intention had a mind to go to church to
see her, and did so — and she is pretty handsome. But over against
our gallery I espied Pembleton and saw him leer upon my wife all
the sermon, I taking no notice of him, and my wife upon him; and
I observed she made a curtsey to him at coming out, without
taking notice to me at all of it; which, with the consideration of
her being desirous these two last Lord’s-days to go to church both
forenoon and afternoon, doth really make me suspect something
more then ordinary. But I must have patience and get her into the
country, or at least to make an end of her learning to dance as soon
as I can.
