I dined with Mr. Sheply at my Lord’s lodgings upon his turkey
pie; and so to my office again, where the Excise money was brought
and some of it told to soldiers till it was dark. Then I went home,
and after writing a letter to my Lord, and told him the news that the
Parliament hath this night voted that the members that was
discharged from setting in the years 1648 and 49 was duly dis-
charged, and that there should be writs issued presently for the
calling of others in their places. And that Monke and Fairfax were
commanded up to town, and that the Prince’s lodgings were to be
provided for Monke at Whitehall. Then I went with my lanthorn to
Mr. Fage to consult concerning my nose, who told me that it was
nothing but cold; and after that, we did discourse concerning public
business, and he told me that it is true the City hath not time enough
to do much, but they are resolved to shake off the soldier[s]; and

that unless there be a free Parliament chosen, he doth believe there
are half the Common Council will not levy any money by order of
this Parliament. From thence I went to my father’s, where I found
Mrs. Ramsey and her grandchild, a pretty girl, and stayed a while
and talked with them and my mother and then took my leave; only,
heard of an invitation to go to dinner tomorrow to my Cosen Tho.
