Lay long in bed with my wife, talking of family matters. And
so up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. And then
home to dinner; and after dinner my wife andI to talk again about
getting of a couple of good maids and to part with Ashwell; which
troubles me for her father’s sake, thoughI shall be glad to have that
charge taken away of keeping a woman.
"17. Up; and then fell into discourse, my wife and I, to Ashwell;
and much against my Will, I am fain to express a willingness to
Ashwell that she should go from us; and yet in my mind Iam glad of
it, to ease me of the charge. So she is to go to her father this day.
And leaving my wife and her talking highly, I went away by coach
with Sir J. Mennes and Sir W. Batten to St. James and there
attended of course* the Duke. And so to Whitehall, where I met
Mr. Moore and he tells me with great sorrow of my Lord’s being
debauched, he fears, by this woman at Chelsy; which I am troubled
at and resolve to speak to himofit ifIcan seasonably.
