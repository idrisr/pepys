the Rhenish winehouse, and Capt. Hayward of the Plymouth, who
is now ordered to carry my Lord Winchelsea Embassador to
Constantinople. We were very merry, and Judge-Advocate did
give Capt. Hayward his oath of Allegiance and Supremacy. Thence
to my office of Privy Seale; and having signed some things there,
with Mr. Moore and Deane Fuller to the Leg in King street; and
sending for my wife, we dined there — very merry, and after dinner
parted. After dinner, with my wife to Mrs. Blackburne to visit her.
She being within, Ileft my wife there; and I to the Privy Seal, where
I despatch some business; and from thence to Mrs. Blackburne
again, who did treat my wife and I with a great deal of civility and
did give usa fine collation of collar of beef, &c. Thence, Ihaving my
head full of drink through having drunk so much Rhenish wine in
the morning and more in the afternoon at Mrs. Blackburne. Came
home and so to bed, not well; and very ill all night.
