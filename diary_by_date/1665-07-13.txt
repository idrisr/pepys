Lay long, being sleepy; and then up to the office, my Lord
Brunker (after his sickness) being come to the office, and did what
business there was; and so I by water, at night late, to Sir G.
Carterets. But there being no oares to carry me, I was fain to call a
Sculler that had a gentleman already in it; and he proved a man of
love to Musique and he and I sung together the way down — with
great pleasure, and an accident extraordinary to be met with. There
came to Dinner, they having dined, but my Lady caused something
to be brought for me and Idined well, and mighty merry, especially
my Lady Slany and IJabout eating of Creame and brown bread —
which she loves as much as I. Thence, after long discourse with
them and my Lady alone, I and wife, who by agreement met me
$02
here, took leave; and I saw my wife a little way down! (it troubling
me that this absence makes us a little strange instead of more fond)
and so parted, and I home to some letters and then home to bed.
Above 700 dead of the plague this week.
