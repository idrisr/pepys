Somy poor wife rose by 5 a-clock in the morning, before day,
and went to market and bought fowle and many other things for
dinner — with which Iwas highly pleased. And the chine of beef was
done also before 6 a-clock, and my own Jacke, of which I was
doubtful, doth carry it very well. Things being put in order and the
Cooke come, I went to the office, where we sat till noon; and then
broke up and I home- whither by and by comes Dr. Clerke and his
lady — his sister and a she-Cosen, and Mr. Pierce and his wife, which
was all my guest[s]. I had for them, after oysters — at first course, a
hash of rabbits and lamb, andarare chine of beef—next, a great dish
of roasted fowl, cost me about 30s., and a tart; and then fruit and
cheese. My dinner was noble and enough. I had my house mighty
clean and neat, my room below with a good fire in it — my dining-
room above, and my chamber being made a withdrawing-
chamber, and my wife’s a good fire also. I find my new table very
proper, and will hold nine or ten people well, but eight with great
room. After dinner, the women to Cards in my wife’s chamber and
the Doctor [and] Mr. Pierce in mine, because the dining-room
smokes unless I keep a good charcole fire, which I was not then
provided with. At night to supper; had a good sack-posset and cold
meat and sent my guests away about 10 a-clock at night — both them
and myself highly pleased with our management of this day. And
indeed, their company was very fine and Mrs. Clerke a very witty,
fine lady, thoughalittle conceited and proud. So weary to bed. I
believe this day’s feast will cost me near 5.
