Lords day. Up and to my chamber, where busy all the
morning; and my thoughts very much upon the manner of my
removal of my closet things the next week into my present
Musique-room, if I find I can spare or get money to furnish it. By
and by comes Reeves by appointment, but did not bring the glasses
and things I expected for our discourse and my information today,
but we have agreed on it for next Sunday. By and by in comes Betty
Michell and her husband; and so to dinner, I mightily pleased with
their company. We passed the whole day talking with them, but
without any pleasure but only her being there. In the evening all
parted, and I and my wife up to her closet to consider how to order
that the next summer, if we live to it. And then down to my
chamber at night to examine her kitchen accounts; and there I took
occasion to fall out with her, for buying of a laced handkercher and
pinner without my leave; though the thing is not much, yet I would
not permit her begin to do so, lest worse should fallow; from this
we begin both to be angry very much, and so continued till bed, and
did not sleep friends.
