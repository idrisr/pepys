Up, having slept well; and after entering my journall, to the
office — where all the morning; but of late Sir W. Coventry hath not
come to us, he being discouraged from the little we have to do but
to answer the clamours of people for money. At noon home, and
there dined with me my Lady Pen only, and W. Hewer, at a haunch
of venison boiled — where pretty merry. Only, my wife vexed mea

little about demanding money to go with my Lady Pen to the
Exchange to lay out. I to the office, where all the afternoon very
busy and doing much business. But here I had a most eminent
experience of the evil of being behindhand in business; I was the
most backward to begin anything, and would fain have framed to
myself
an occasion of going abroad, and should Idoubt have done it
— but some business coming in, one after another, kept me there,
and I fell to the ridding away of a great deal of business; and when
my hand was in it, was so pleasing a sight to [see] my papers
disposed of, and letters answered which troubled my book and
table, that I could have continued there with delight all night long;
and did, till called away by my Lady Pen and Pegg and my wife to
their house to eat with them; and there I went, and exceeding
merry, there being Nan Wright, now Mrs. Markeham, and sits at
table with my Lady. So mighty merry, home and to bed.
