Up, and had a mighty mind to have seen or given a note to
Deb or to have given her a little money; to which purpose |
wrapped up 40s. in a paper, thinking to give her; but my wife rose
presently, and would not let me be out of her sight; and went down
before me into the kitchen, and came up and told me that she was in
the kitchen, and therefore would have me go round the other way;
which she repeating, and I vexed at it, answered hera little angrily;
upon which she instantly flew out into a rage, calling me dog and
rogue, and that I had a rotten heart; all which, knowing that I
deserved it, I bore with; and word being brought presently up that
she was gone away by coach with her things, my wife was friends;
and so all quiet, and I to the office with my heart sad, and find that I
cannot forget the girl, and vexed Iknow not where to look for her—
and more troubled to see how my wife is by this means likely for
960
ever to have her hand over me, that I shall for ever be a slave to her;
that is to say, only in matters of pleasure, but in other things she will
make her business, I know, to please me and to keep me right to her
— whichI will labour to be endeed, for she deserves it of me, though
it will be I fear a little time before I shall be able to wear Deb out of
my mind. At the office all the morning, and merry at noon at
dinner; and after dinner to the office, where all the afternoon and
doing much business late; my mind being free of all troubles, I
thank God, but only for my thoughts of this girl, which hang after
her. And so at night home to supper, and there did sleep with great
content with my wife. I must here remember that I have lain with
my moher as a husband more times since this falling-out then in I
believe twelve months before—and with more pleasure to her then I
think in all the time of our marriage before.
