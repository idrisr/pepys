Lords day. Accidentally, talking of our maids before we rose, I
saida little word that did give occasion to my wife to fall out, and
she did most vexatiously almost all the morning, but ended most
perfect good friends; but the thoughts of the unquiet which her
ripping up of old faults will give me did make me melancholy all
day long. So about noon, past 12, we rose; and to dinner and then to
aT
read and talk, my wife and I alone, after Balty was gone, who came
to dine with us; and then in the evening comes Pelling to sit and talk
with us, and so to supper and pretty merry discourse; only, my
mindalittle vexed at the morning’s work, but yet without any
appearance; so after supper, to bed.
