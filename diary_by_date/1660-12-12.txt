Troubled for the absence of my wife. After dinner to the Privy
Seale and sealed abundance of pardons, and little else. From thence
to the Exchequer and upwith J.Spicer to his office and took tool;
and by Coach with it as far as my father’s, where I called to see
them, and my father did offer me six pieces of gold in lieu of six
pounds that he borrowed of me the other day; but it went against
me to take of him, and therefore did not, though I was afterward a
little troubled that I did not. Thence home and told out this rool and
sealed it up with the other last night, it being the first 200/ that ever I
saw together of my own in my life — for which God be praised. So
to my Lady Battens and sat an hour or two and talked with her
daughter and people, in the absence of her father and mother and
my wife, to pass away the time. After that home and to bed —
reading myself asleep while the wench sat mending my breeches by
my bedside.
