Up betimes and to my office, preparing an account to give the
Duke this morning of what we have of late done at the office. About
7 a-clock I went forth, thinking to go along with Sir John Minnes
and the rest, and I find them gone, which did vex me; so I went
directly to the old Swan and took boat before them and to Sir G.
Carteret’s lodgings at Whitehall; and there staying till he was
dressed, talking with him, he and I to St. James’s, where Sir Wms
both andSir John were come; and so up with Mr. Coventry to the
Duke, who after he was out of his bed, did send for us in; and when
he was quite ready, took us into his closet and there told us that he
doth entend to renew the old custom for the Admiralls* to have
their principal officers to meet them once a week to give them an
account what they have done that week, which I am glad of; and so
the rest did tell his Royal Highness that Icould do it best for the time
past, and so I produced my short notes and did give him an account
of all that we have of late done and proposed to him several things
for his commands; which he did give us and so dismiss us.
