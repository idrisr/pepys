Up and to the office, after having visited Sir W. Coventry at
the Tower and walked with him upon the Stone Walk alone, till
other company came to him, and had very good discourse with
him. At noon home, where my wife and Jane gone abroad, and
Tom, in order to their buying of things for their wedding; which,
upon my discourse the last night, is now resolved to be done upon
the 26 of this month, the day of my solemnity for my cutting of the
stone, when my Cosen Turner must be with us. My wife therefore
not at dinner; and in comes to me Mr. Evelin of Deptford, a worthy
good man, and dined with me, but a bad dinner; who is grieved for,
and speaks openly to me his thoughts of the times and our ruin
approaching, and all by the folly of the King.
