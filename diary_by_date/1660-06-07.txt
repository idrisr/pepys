About 3 in the morning the people begun to wash the deck and
the water came pouring into my mouth, which wakened me; and I
was fain to rise and get on my gown, and sleep leaning upon my
table. After dinner came Mr. John Wright and Mr. Moore, with the
sight of whom my heart was very glad. They brought an order for
my Lord’s coming up to London — which my Lord resolved to do
tomorrow.
