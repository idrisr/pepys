Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and at noon
home to dinner, and there find Mr. Pierce and his wife and Betty, a
pretty girl — who in discourse at table told me of the great Proviso
passed the House of Parliament yesterday, which makes the King
and Court mad — the King having given order to my Lord
Chamberlain to send the playhouses (and bawdy houses) to bid all
the Parliament-men that were there to go to the Parliament
presently — this 1s true, it seems — but it was carried against the Court
by 30 or 40 voices. It is a Proviso to the Poll Bill, that there shall be a
committee of nine persons that shall have the inspection, upon oath
I. sc. in her choice of him.
700
and power of giving oaths, of all the accounts of the money given
and spent for this warr. This hath a most sad face, and will breed
very ill blood — he tells me brought in by Sir Robt. Howard, who is
one of the King’s servants, at least hath a great office and hath got,
they say, 20000! since the King came in. Mr. Pierce did also tell me
as a great truth, as being told it by Mr. Cowly, who was by and
heard it — that Tom Killigrew should publicly tell the King that his
matters were coming into a very ill state, but that yet there was a
way to help all— whichis, says he, ““There is a good honest able man
that I could name, that if your Majesty would imploy and
command to see all things well executed, all things would soon be
mended; and this is one Charles Stuart — who now spends his time
in imploying his lips and his prick about the Court, and hath no
other imployment. But ifyou would give him this imployment, he
were the fittest man in the world to perform it.’’ This he says is
most true. But the King doth not profit by any of this, but lays all
aside and remembers nothing, but to his pleasures again—which is a
sorrowful consideration.
I saw smoke in the ruines this very day.
