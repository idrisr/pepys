Up and to the office, where some of us sat busy all the
morning. At noon home to dinner, whither Creed came to dine
with us and brings the first word I hear of the news of a peace, the
King having letters come to him this noon, signifying that it is
concluded on. The news was so good and sudden, that I went with
great joy to W. Batten and then to W. Penn to tell it them; and so
home to dinner, mighty merry and light at my heart only on this
ground, that a continuing of the war must undo us, and so, though
peace may do the like, if we do not make good use of it to reform
ourselfs and get up money, yet there is an opportunity for us to save
ourselfs — at least, for my own perticular, we shall continue well till
I can get my money into my hands, and then J will shift for myself.
After dinner away, leaving Creed there, by coach to Westminster,
where to the Swan and drank; and then to the Hall and there talked a
little, with great joy of the peace; and then to Mrs. Martins, where I
met with the good news que esta no es con child, she having de estos
upon her — the fear of which, which she did give me the other day,
had troubled me much. My joy in this made me send for wine, and
thither came her sister and Mrs. Cragg and I stayed a good while
there. But here happened the best instance of a woman’s falseness in
the world; that her sister Doll, who went for a bottle of wine, did
come home all blubbering and swearing against one Capt.
Vandena, a Dutchman of the Rhenish winehouse, that pulled her
into a stable by the Dog tavern and there did tumble her and toss
her; calling him all the rogues and toads in the world, when she
knows that ella hath suffered me to do anything with her a hundred
times.
