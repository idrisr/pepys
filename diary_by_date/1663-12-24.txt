Up betimes; and though it was a most foggy morning and
cold, yet with a gally down to Eriffe, several times being at a loss
whither we went. There I mustered two ships of the King’s, lent by
him to the Guiny Company, which are manned better then ours at
far less wages. Thence on board twoofthe King’s; one of them the
Leopard, Capt. Beech, who I find an able and serious man. He
received me civilly, and his wife was there, a very well-bred and
knowing woman — born at Antwerp, but speaks as good English as
myself, and an ingenious woman. Here was also Sir G. Carteret’s
son, whoIfind a pretty, but very talking man; but good humour.
Thence back again, entertaining myself upon my sliding-rule with
great content; and called at Woolwich, where Mr. Chr. Pett,
having an opportunity of being alone, did tell me his mind about
several things he thought I was offended with him in, and told me
of my kindness to his Assistant; I did give him such an answer as I
thought was fit, and left him well satisfied — he offering to do me all
the service, either by draughts or modells, that I should desire.
Thence straight home, being very cold but yet well, I thank God.
And at home find my wife making mince-pies; and by and by
comes in Capt. Ferrers to see us and among other talk, tells us of the
goodness of the new play of Henry the 8th, which makes me think
long till my time is out; but Ihope before Igo, Ishall set myself such
a stint as I may not forget myself, as I have hitherto done till I was
forced for these [six] months last past wholly to forbid myself the
seeing of one. He gone, I to my office and there late, writing and
reading; and so home to bed.
