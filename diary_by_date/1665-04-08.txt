The French Embassadors are come incognito before their train,
which will hereafter be very pompous. It is thought they come to
get our King to joyne with the King of France in helping him
against Flanders, and they to do the like to us against Holland. We
have lain a good while with a good fleet at Harwich. The Dutch not
said yet to be out. We, as high as we make our show, I am sure are
unable to set out another small fleet, if this should be worsted.
Wherefore,God send us peace I cry.
