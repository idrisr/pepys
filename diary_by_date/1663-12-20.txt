Lords day. After a dull sermon of the Scotchman, home; and
there Ifind my brother Tom and my two Cosens Scotts, he and she
— the first time they were ever here, And by and by in comes my
uncle Wight and Mr. Norbury, and they sat with us a while
drinking of wine, of which I did give them plenty. But they two
would not stay supper, but the other two did; and we were as merry
as I could be with people that I do wish well to but know not what
discourse either to give them or find from them. We showed them
our house from top to bottom, and had a good turkey roasted for
our supper, and store of wine. And after supper sent them home on
foot; and so we to prayers and to bed.
