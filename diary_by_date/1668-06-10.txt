W. Up, and walked to the Hospitall: very large and fine; and
pictures of founders, and the history of the Hospitall; and is said to
be worth 700! per annum; and that Mr. Foly was here lately to see
how their lands were settled. And here, in old English, the story of
the occasion of it, and a Rebus at the bottom. So did give the poor,
which they would not take but in their box, 2s. 6d. So to the inn,
and paid the reckoning and servants, 13s. So forth towards
Hungerford, led this good way by our landlord, one Heart, a old
but very civil and well-spoken man, more than I ever heard of that
quality. He gone, we forward; and I vexed at my peoples not
minding the way. So came to Hungerford, where very good trouts,
eels, and crayfish dinner. A bad mean town. At dinner there, 12s.
Thence set out with a guide, who saw us to [Black Heath], and then
left us, 3s. 6d. So all over the Plain by the sight of the steeple, the
plain high and low, to Salsbury, by night; but before came to the
town, I saw a great fortification, and there light, and to it and in it;
and find it prodigious, so as to fright me to be in it all alone at that
time of night, it being dark. I understand it since to be that that is
922
called Old Sarum. Came to the town, George Inne, where lay in
silk bed; and very good diet. To supper; then to bed.
