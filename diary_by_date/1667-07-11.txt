Up betimes and to my office, and there busy till the office
(which was only Sir T. Harvy and myself) met; and did little
business and then broke up. He tells me that the Council last night
did sit close, to determine of the King’s answer about the peace; and
that though he doth not certainly know, yet by all discourse
yesterday, he doth believe it is peace; and that the King had said it
should be peace and had bidden Ald. Backewell to declare upon the
Change.
