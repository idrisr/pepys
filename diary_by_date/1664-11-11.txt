Up, and with Sir
J.Mennes and Sir W. Batten to the council
chamber at Whitehall, to the committee of the Lords for the Navy —
where we were made to wait an hour or two before called in. Sir
Edw. Walker coming in, in discourse did say that there was none of
the families of princes in Christendom that do derive themselfs so
high as Julius Cesar, nor so far by a thousand years, that can
directly prove their rise. Only, some in Germany do derive
themselfs from the patrician familys of Rome, but that uncertainly.

general true, as the Romance of Cleopatra, the world will not know
which is the true and which the false. Here was a gentleman

attending here that told us he saw the other day, and did bring the
draft of it to Sir Fr. Prigeon, of a monster born of an hostlers wife at
Salsbury; two women-children perfectly made, joyned at the lower
part of their bellies, and every part perfect as two bodies, and only
one payre of legs, coming forth on one side from the middle where
they were joined. It was alive 24 hours, and cried and did as all
hopeful children do; but being showed too much to people, was
killed. By and by we were called in, where a great many lords —
Annesly in the chair. But Lord, to see what work they will make us,
and what trouble we shall have to inform men in a business they are
to begin to know when the greatest of our hurry is, is a thing to be
lamented — and I fear the consequence will be bad to us.
