Up betimes to my office, where busy till 8 a-clock, that Sir W.
Batten, Sir J. Mennes, Sir W. Penn and I down by barge to
Woolwich to see the Royall James lanched, where she hath been
under repair a great while. We stayed in the yard till almost noon,
and then to Mr. Falconer’s to a dinner of fish of our own sending.
And when it was just ready to come upon the table, word is brought
that the King and Duke are come, so they all went away to show
themselfs, while I stayed and hadalittle dish or two by myself,
resolving to go home; and by the time Ihad dined, they came again,
having gone to little purpose, the King I believe taking little notice
of them. So they to dinner, and I stayeda little with them and so
good-bye. I walked to Greenwich, studying my slide-rule for
measuring of timber, which is very fine. Thence to Deptford by
water and walked through the yard, and so walked to Redriffe and
so home, pretty weary, and to my office; where anon they all came
home, the ship well lanched, and so sat at the office till 9 at night —
and I longer, doing business at my office; and so home to supper,
my father being come, and to bed.
