Atsermon in the morning. After dinner into my cabin to cast
my accounts up; and find myself to be worth near rool, for whichI
bless Almighty God
— it being more then Ihoped for so soon; being,
I believe, not clearly worth 25! when I came to sea, besides my
house and goods. Then to set my papers in order, they being
increased much upon my hand through want of time to put them in
order.
