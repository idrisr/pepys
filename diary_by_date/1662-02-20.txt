This morning came Mr. Childe to see me, and set me
something to my Theorbo. And by and by comes letters from
Tanger from my Lord, telling me-how, upon a great defeate given
to the Portugeses there by the Moores, he had put in 300 men into
the Towne, and so hee is in possession; of which we are very glad,
because now the Spaniards designes of hindering our getting that
place are frustrated. I went with the letters inclosed to my Lord
Chancellor to the House of Lords, and did give it him in the House.
