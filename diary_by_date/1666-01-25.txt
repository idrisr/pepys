office then, where I did much business and set my people to work
against furnishing me to go to Hampton Court, where the King and
Duke will be on Sunday next. It is now certain that the King of
France hath publicly declared war against us, and God knows how
little fit we are for it. At night comes Sir W. Warren, and he and |
into the garden and talked over all our business. He gives me good
advice, not to imbark into trade (as I have had it in my thoughts

and so to bed.
