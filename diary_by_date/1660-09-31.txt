Early to wait upon my Lord at Whitehall; and with him to the
Duke’s chamber. So to my office in Seething lane. Dined at home;
and after dinner to my Lord again; who told me that he is ordered to
go suddenly to sea,? and did give me some orders to be drawing
upon against his going. This afternoon I agreed to let my house
quite out of my hands to Mr. Dalton (ofthe wine-cellar to the King,
with whom I have drunk in the old wine-cellar two or three times)
for 411. At night, made up even at Privy Seale for this month against
tomorrow to give up possession, and so home and to bed. Blessed
be God all things continue well with and for me; I pray God fit me
for a change of my fortune.
1. Will Hewer.
2. To bring over the Princess Royal from Holland.
