made him embassador in the bringing over the Queen.” That he is
to go to Algier &c. to settle that business and to put the fleet in order
there; and so to come back to Lisbone with three ships, and there to
meet the fleet that is to fallow him. He sent for me to tell me that he
doth intrust me with the seeing of all things done in his absence as to
this great preparation, as I shall receive orders from my Lord
Chancellor and Mr. Edw. Mountagu. At all which, my heart is
above measure glad — for my Lord’s honour, and some profit to
myself I hope. I stayed and dined with my Lady; but after we were
sat, comes in some persons of condition; and so the children and I
rise and dined by ourselfs, all the children and I, and were very
merry —and they mighty fond of me. ThenI to the office, and there
sat a while. So home; and at night to bed — where we lay in Sir R.
Slingsby’s lodgings — in the dining-room there, in our green bed —
my house being now in its last work of painting and whiting.
