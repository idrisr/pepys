This afternoon Sir W. Warren and Mr. Moore, one after
another, walked with me in the garden; and they both tell me that
my Lord Sandwich is called home. And that he doth grow more
and more in esteem everywhere, and is better spoken of — which I
am mighty glad — though I know well enough his deserving the
same before, and did foresee that it will come to it. In mighty great
pain in my back still. But I perceive it changes its place — and doth
not trouble me at all in making ofwater; and that is my joy, so that I
believe it is nothing but a strain. And for these three or four days I
perceive my overworking of my eyes by Candlelight doth hurt
them, as it did the last winter. That by day I am well and do get
702
them right — but then after candlelight they begin to sore and run —
so that I entend to get some green spectacles.
