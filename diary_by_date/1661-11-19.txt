At the office all the morning; and coming home, find Mr.
Hunt with my wife in the chamber alone; which God forgive me,
did trouble my head; but remembering that it was washing-day and
that there was no place else witha fire for him to be in, it being also
cold weather, I was at ease again. He dined with us; and after dinner
took coach and carried him with us as far as my Cosen Scotts
(where we set him down and parted) and my wife and Istayed there
at the christening of my Cosens boy — where my Cosen Sam. Pepys
of Ireland and I were godfathers. And I did name the child Samuell.
There was a company of pretty women there in the chamber; but
we stayed not, but went with the Minister into another room and
eat and drank. And at last, when most of the women were gone,
Sam and I went into my Cosen Scott, who was got off her bed; and
so we stayed and talked and were very merry (my she-Cosen
164
Stradwick being godmother); and then Ileft my wife to go home by
coach. (It cost me 20s. between the midwife and the two nurses
today.)
