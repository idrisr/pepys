Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the
439
Change and thence home to dinner; and so with my wife to the
Duke’s house to a play, Macbeth; a pretty good play, but admirably
acted. Thence home, the coach being forced to go round by London
wall home because of the Bonefires — the day being mightily
observed in the City. To my office late at business; and then home
to supper and to bed.
