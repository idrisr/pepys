To my Lord’s, where we find him newly come from
Hinchingbrooke, where he left my uncle very well, but my aunt
not likely to live. I stayed and dined with him. He took me asside
and asked me what the world spoke of the King’s marriage. Which]
answering as one that knew nothing, he enquired no further of me.
But I do perceive by it that there is something in it that is ready to
come out, that the world knows not of yet.
