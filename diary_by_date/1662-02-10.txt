Musique practice a good while. Then to Pauls churchyard,
and there I met with Dr: Fullers Englands worthys—the first time that
I ever saw it; and so I sat down reading in it, till it was 2 a-clock
before I thought of the time’s going. And so I rose and went home
to dinner, being much troubled that (though he had some discourse
with me about my family and armes) he says nothing at all, nor
mentions us either in Cambrige or Norfolke. But I believe endeed,
our family were never considerable. At home all the afternoon; and
at night to bed.
