Spend the evening with my poor wife — consulting about her
closet, clothes, and other things. At night to supper, though with
little comfort, I finding myself, both head and breast, in great pain;
and which troubles me most, my right eare is almost deaf. It is a
cold, which God Almighty in justice did give me while I sat lewdly
sporting with Mrs. Lane the other day with the broken window in
my neck. I went to bed with a posset, being very melancholy in
consideration of the loss of my hearing.
