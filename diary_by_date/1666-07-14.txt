Up betimes to the office, to write fair a laborious letter I
wrote, as from the Board, to the Duke of York, laying out our want
of money again. That being done, I down to Thames Streete and
there agreed for four or five Tons of Corke to send this day to the
fleet, being a new device to make Barrecados with, instead ofJunke.
By this means I came to see and kiss Mr. Hill’s young wife; and a
blithe young woman she is. So to the office, and at noon home to
dinner; and then sent for young Michell and imployed him all the
afternoon about weighing and shipping off of the Corke — having
by this means an opportunity of getting him 30 or 4os. Having set
him a-doing, I home and to the office very late, very busy, and did
endeed despatch much business; and so to supper and to bed—after a
song in the garden — which, and after dinner, is now the greatest
pleasure I take, and endeed doth please me mightily. To bed, after
washing my legs and feet with warm water in my Kitchin. This
evening I had Davila brought home to me, and I find it a most
excellent history as ever I read.
