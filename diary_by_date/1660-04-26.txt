This day came Mr. Donne back from London, who brought
letters with him that signify the meeting of the Parliament
yesterday. And in the afternoon, by other letters I hear that about
twelve of the Lords met and have chosen my Lord of Manchester
Speaker of the House of Lords (the young Lords that never sot yet,
do forbear to sit for the present); and Sir Harbottle Grimstone
Speaker of the House of Commons. Dr. Renalds preached before
the Commons before they sat. My Lord told me how Sir H.
Yelverton (formerly my schoolfellow) was chosen in the first place
for Northamptonshire and Mr. Crew in the second. And told me
how he did believe that the Cavaliers have now the upper hand clear
of the Presbyterians. All the afternoon I was writing of letters;
among the rest, one to W. Simons, Peter Luellin and Tom Doling;
which because it is somewhat merry, I keep a copy of. After that
done, Mr. Sheply, W. Howe and I down with Jo. Goods into my
Lord’s Storeroome of wine and other drink, where it was very
pleasant to observe the massy timbers that the ship is made of. We
in the room were wholly under water and yet a deck below that.
After that to supper, where Tom Guy supped with us and we had
very good laughing; and after that some Musique, where Mr.
Pickering, beginning to play a bass part upon my viall, did it so like
a fool that I was ashamed of him. After that to bed.
