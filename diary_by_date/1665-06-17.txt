It stroke me very deep this afternoon, going with a Hackny-
coach from my Lord Treasurer’s down Holborne — the coachman I
found to drive easily and easily; at last stood still, and came down
hardly able to stand; and told me that he was suddenly stroke very
sick and almost blind, he could not see. So I light and went into
another coach, with a sad heart for the poor man and trouble for
myself, lest he should have been stroke with the plague — being at
that end of the town that I took him up. But God have mercy upon
us all. Sir Jo. Lawson, I hear, is worse then yesterday — the King
went to see him today, most kindly. It seems his wound is not very
bad, but he hath a fever — a thrush and a Hickup, all three together;
which are, it seems, very bad symptoms.
