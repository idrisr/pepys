Lay long in bed—and by and by called up by Sir H. Chumbly,
who tells me that my Lord Middleton is for certain chosen
Governor of Tanger; a man of moderate understanding, not
covetous, but a soldier of fortune and poor. But by and by comes
Dr. Childe by appointment, and sat with me all the morning,
making me Bases and inward parts to several songs that I desired of
755
him — to my great content. Then dined and then abroad by coach,
and I set him down at Hatton Guarden andI to the King’s house by
chance, where a new play; so full as I never saw it, I forced to stand
all the while close to the very door, till ltook cold, and many people
went away for want of room. The King and Queen and Duke of
York and Duchesse there and all the Court, and Sir W. Coventry.
The play called The Change ofCrownes, a play of Ned Howard’s, the
best that I ever saw at that House, being a great play and serious;
only, Lacy did act the country gentleman come up to Court, who
doth abuse the Court with all the imaginable wit and plainness,
about selling of places and doing everything for money. The play
took very much. Thence I to my new bookseller’s and there bought
Hookers Policy, the new edition, and Dugdale’s history of the Inns
of Court, of which there was but a few saved out of the Fire — and
Playfords new ketch-book, that hath a great many new fooleries in
it. Then home; alittle at the office, and then to supper and to bed,
mightily pleased with the new play.
