Up betimes, .and upon a meeting extraordinary at the office
most of the morning, with Lord Brouncker, Sir W. Coventry, Sir
W. Penn-upon the business of the accounts — where, now we have
got almost as much as we would have, we begin to lay all on the
Controller — andI fear he will be run down with it, for he is every
day less and less capable of doing business. Thence with my Lord
Brouncker [and] Sir W. Coventry to the ticket office to see in what
599
little order things are there; and there it is a shame to see how the
King is served. Thence to the Chamberlain of London and satisfy
ourselfs more perticularly how much credit we have there, which
proves very little. Thence to Sir Rob. Long’s [in his] absence —
about much the same business, but have not the satisfaction we
would have there neither. So Sir W. Coventry parted, and my Lord
and I to Mrs. Williams’s and there I saw her closet, where endeed a
great many fine things there are — but the woman I hate. Here we
dined, and Sir
J.Minnes came to us — and after dinner we walked to
the King’s playhouse, all in dirt, they being altering of the Stage to
make it wider — but God knows when they will begin to act again.
But my business here was to see the inside of the Stage and all the
tiring roomes and Machines; and endeed it was a sight worthy
seeing. But to see their clothes and the various sorts, and what a
mixture of things there was, here a wooden leg, there a ruff, here a
hobby-horse, there a Crowne, would make a man split himself to
see with laughing — and perticularly Lacys wardrobe, and Shot-
rell’s. But then again, to think how fine they show on the stage by
candlelight, and how poor things they are to look now too near-
hand, is not pleasant at all. The Machines are fine, and the paintings
very pretty.
