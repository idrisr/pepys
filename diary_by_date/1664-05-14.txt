Up, full of pain, Ibelieve by cold got yesterday. To the office,
where we sat; and after office, home to dinner, being in extra-
ordinary pain. After dinner, my pain increasing, I was forced to go
to bed; and by and by my pain ris to be as great for an hour or two as
ever I remember it was in any fit of the stone, both in the lower part
of my belly and in my back also. No wind could I break. I took a
glister, but it brought away but a little and my heighth of pain
fallowed it. At last, after two hours lying thus in most extra-
ordinary anguish, crying and roaring, I know not whether it was
my great sweating that [made] me do it, but upon getting by chance
among my other tumblings, upon my knees in bed, my pain begin
to grow less and so continued less and less, till in an hour after I was
in very little pain, but could break no wind nor make any water; and
so continued and slept well all night.
