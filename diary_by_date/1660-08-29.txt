Office day. Before I went to the office, my wife and I
examined my boy Will about his stealing of things, as we doubted
yesterday; but he denied all with the greatest subtility and
confidence in the world. To the office; and after office, then to the
74
church, where we took another view of the place where we had
resolved to build a gallery; and have set men about doing it. Home
to dinner; and there I find that my wife hath discovered my boy’s
theft and a great deal more then we imagined. At whichI was vexed
and entend to put him away. To my office at Privy Seale in the
afternoon; and from thence at night to the Bull head with Mount,
Luellin and others; and thence to my father’s; and he being at my
uncle Fenner’s, I went thither to him, and there sent for my boy’s
father and talked with him about his son and had his promise that if
I will send home his boy, he will take him notwithstanding his
indentures. Home at night; and find that my wife hath found out
more, of the boy’s stealing 6s. out of W. Ewres closet and hid it in
the house of office — at which my heart was troubled. To bed and
caused the boy’s clothes to be brought up to my chamber. But after
we were all a-bed, the wench (which lies in our chamber) called us
to listen of a sudden; which put my wife into such a fright that she
shook, every joynt of her, and a long time that I could not get her
out of it. That noise was the boy, we did believe, was got in a
desperate mood out of his bed to do himself or Wm.’ some
mischief. But the wench went down and got a candle lighted; and
finding the boy in bed and locking the doors fast, with a candle
burning all night, we slept well, but with a great deal of fear.
