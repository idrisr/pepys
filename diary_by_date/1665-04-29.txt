All the morning busy at the office. In the afternoon to my
Lord Treasurers and there got my Lord Treasurer to sign the
warrant for my striking of tallies.’ And so doing many Jobbs in my
way. Home, and there late writing letters — being troubled in my
mind to hear that Sir W. Batten and Sir
J.Mennes do take notice
that Iam nowadays much from the office, upon no office business —
which vexes me, and will make me mind my business the better, I
hope in God. But what troubles me more, is that I do omit to write,
as I should do, to Mr. Coventry; which I must not do, though this
night I minded it so little as to sleep in the middle of my letter to
him, and committed forty blotts and blurrs in my letter to him. But
of this I hope never more to be guilty — if I have not already given
him sufficient offence. So late home, and to bed.
