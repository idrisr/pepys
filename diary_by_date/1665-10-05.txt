Lay long in bed, talking; among other things, talking of my
sister Pall, and my wife of herself is very willing that I should give
her 400/ to her portion — and would have her married as soon as we
could; but this great sickness time doth make it unfit to send for her
up. I abroad to the office, and thence to the Duke of Albemarle, all
my way reading a book of Mr. Evelins translating, and sending me
as a present, about directions of gathering a Library, but the book is
above my reach, but his epistle to my Lord Chancellor is a very fine
piece. When I came to the Duke, it was about the victuallers
business, to put it into other hands, or more hands — which I do
advise in, but I hope to do myself a jobb of work in it. So I walked
through Westminster to my old house, the Swan, and there did pass
some time with Sarah; and so down by water to Deptford and there
to my Valentine’s; round about and next door on every side is the
plague, but Idid not value it but there did what Iwould con ella; and
so away to Mr. Evelings to discourse of our confounded business of
prisoners and sick and wounded seamen, wherein he and we are so
much put out of order. And here he showed me his gardens, which
are, for variety of Evergreens and hedge of Holly, the finest things I
ever saw in my life. Thence in his coach to Greenwich,
and there to
my Office, all the way having fine discourse of Trees and the nature
of vegetables. And so to write letters I very late, to Sir W.
Coventry, of great concernment; and so to my last night’s lodging,’
but my wife is gone home to Woolwich. The Bill, blessed be
1. At Greenwich.

God, is less this week by 740 of what it was the last week. Being
come to my lodging, I got something to eat, having eat little all
the day, and so to bed — having this night renewed my promises
of observing my vowes as I used to do, for I find that since I
left
them off, my minde is run a’wool-gathering and neglected my
business.
