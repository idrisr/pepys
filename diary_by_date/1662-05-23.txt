At the office good part of the morning. And then about noon
with my wife on foot to the Wardrobe. My wife went up to the
dining-roome to my Lady Paulina and I stayed below, talking with
Mr. Moore in the parler, reading of the King and Chancellors late
speeches at the prorogueing of the Houses of Parliament. And
while I was reading, news is brought me that my Lord Sandwich is
come and gone up to my Lady — which put me into great suspence
of joy. So I went up, waiting my Lord’s coming out of my Lady’s
chamber
— which by and by he did, and looks very well and my soul
is glad to see him. He very merry. And hath left the King and
Queene at Portsmouth, and is come up to stay here till next
Wednesday, and then to meet the King and Queen at Hampton
Court.
