At my business till late at night; then with my wife into the
garden, and there-sang with Mercer — whom I feel myself
beginning to love too much, by handling of her breasts in a
morning when she dresses me, they being the finest that ever I saw
in my life; that is the truth of
it. So home, and to supper with beans
and bacon, and to bed.
