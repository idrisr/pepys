Up, and all the morning at the office, and then home to
dinner; and after dinner, out with my wife and my two girls to the
Duke of York’s House and there saw The Gratefull Servant, a pretty
good play, and which I have forgot that ever I did see. And thence
with them to Mrs. Gotiers, the Queen’s tire-woman’s, for a pair of
locks for my wife (she is a oldish French woman, but with a pretty
hand as most I have seen); and so home and to supper, W. Battelier
and W. Hewer with us; and so my cold being great, and the greater
by my having left my coat at my tailor’s tonight and come home in
a thinner that Iborrowed there, I went to bed before them, and slept
pretty well.
