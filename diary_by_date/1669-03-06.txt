Up and to the office, where all the morning. Only before the
office, I stepped to Sir W. Coventry at the Tower and there had a
great deal of discourse with him — among others, of the King’s
putting him out of the Council yesterday — with which he is well
contented, as with what else they can strip him of — he telling me,
and so hath long, that he is weary and surfeited of business. But he
joins with me in his fears that all will go to naught as matters are
now managed. He told me the matter of the play that was intended
for his abuse — wherein they foolishly and sillily bring in two tables
like that which he hath made, with a round hole in the middle, in his
closet, to turn himself in; and he is to be in one of them as maister,
and Sir
J.Duncomb in the other as his man or imitator — and their
discourse in those tables, about the disposing of their books and
papers, very foolish. But that that he is offended with, is his being
made so contemptible, as that any should dare to make a gentleman
a subject for the mirth of the world; and that therefore he had told
Tom Killigrew that he should tell his actors, whoever they were,
that did offer at anything like representing him, that he would not
complain to my Lord Chamberlain, which was too weak, nor get
him beaten, as Sir Ch. Sidly is said to do, but that he would cause his
995
nose to be cut. This day, my wife made it appear to me that my late
entertainment this week cost me above 12], a expense which I am
almost ashamed of, though it is but once in a great while, and is the
end for which in the most part we live, to have such a merry day
once or twice in a man’s life.
