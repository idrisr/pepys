I dined at home; and after dinner went to the new Theatre and
there I saw The Merry Wifes of Windsor acted. The humours of the
Country gentleman and the French Doctor very well done; but the
rest but very poorly, and Sir]. Falstaffe as bad as any. From thence1
went to my father’s and there found my mother still ill of the stone
and hath just newly voided one, which she hath let drop into the
Chimny; and could not find it to show it me. From thence home
and to bed.
