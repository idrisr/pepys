After dinner to my Lord, who took me to Secretary Nicholas;
and there, before him and Secretary Morris, my Lord and I, upon
our knees, together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy
and the oath of the Privy Seale— of which Iwas much glad, though I
am not likely to get anything by it at present; but I do desire it, for
fear of a turn-out of our office. That done and my Lord gone from
me, I went with Mr. Cooling and his Brother and Sam Hartlibb,
little Jenings and some others to the King’s head tavern at Charing
cross; where after drinking, I took boat and so home. Where we
supped merrily among ourselfs (our little boy proving a droll); and
so after prayers, to bed.
