Sunday. In the morning I went to Mr. Gunings, where a good
sermon, wherein he showed the life of Christ and told us good
authority for us to believe that Christ did fallow his father’s trade,
and was a carpenter till 30 years of age. From thence to my father’s
to dinner; where I found my wife, who was forced to dine there, we
not having one coal of fire in the house and it being very hard frosty
weather.
