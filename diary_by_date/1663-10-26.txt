Creed and I to the Kings head Ordinary, where much and
very good company; among others, one very talking man, but a
Scholler, that would needs put in his discourse and philosophy
upon every occasion; and though he did well enough, yet his
readiness to speak spoilt all. Thence Creed and I to one or two
Periwegg shops about the Temple (having been very much
displeased with one that we saw, a head of greazy and old woman’s
haire, at Jervas’s in the morning); and there I think I shall fit myself
of one very handsomely made.
