Up and to the office; and then my wife being gone with the
coach to see her mother at Deptford, I, before the office sat, went to
the Excise Office; and thence, being alone, stepped into Duck lane
and thence tried to have sent a porter to Deb’s, but durst not trust
him. And therefore, having bought a book to satisfy the bookseller
for my stay there, a 12d. book, Andronicus of Tom Fuller, I took
coach; and at the end of Jewen street next Red cross street, I sent the
coachman to her lodging, and understand she is:gone to Greenwich
to one Marys’s, a tanner’s; at which I was glad, hoping to have
opportunity to find her out there. And so, in great fear of being
seen, I to the office and there all morning. Dined at home; and
presently after dinner comes home my wife, who I believe was
jealous of my spending the day; and I had very good fortune in
being at home, for ifDeb had been to have been found, it is forty to
one but I had been abroad — God forgive me. So the afternoon at the
office; and at night walked with my wife in the garden, and my
Lord Brouncker with us, who is newly come to W. Pen’s lodgings.
And by and by comes Mr. Hooke, and my Lord and he and I into
my Lord’s lodging and there discoursed of many fine things in
philosophy, to my great content; and so home to supper and to bed.
