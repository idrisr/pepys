Lords day. Up by 4 a-clock, and to the settling of my own
accounts, and I do find upon my monthly ballance (which I have
undertaken to keep from month to month) that lam worth 6501, the
greatest sum that ever I was yet master of. I pray God give me a
thankful spirit, and care to improve and increase it.
