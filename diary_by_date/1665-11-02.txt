Up, left my wife, and to the office; and there to my great
content Sir W. Warren came to me to settle the business of the
Tanger boates, wherein I shall get above 100l, besides a 100! which
he gives me in the paying for them out of his own purse. He gone, I
home to my lodgings to dinner; and there comes Capt. Wager,
newly returned from the Streights, who puts me in great fears for
our last ships that went to Tanger with provisions, that they will be
taken. A brave stout fellow this Captain is, and I think very honest.
To the office again after dinner, and there late, writing letters. And
then about 8 at night set out from my office, and fitting myself at
my lodging, entended to have gone this night in a ketch down to the
fleet. But calling in my way at Sir Jo. Minnes’s, who is coming up
from Erith about something about the prizes — they persuaded me
not to go till the morning, it being a horrible dark and a windy
night. So I back to my lodgings, and to bed.
