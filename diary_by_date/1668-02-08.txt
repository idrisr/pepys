Up and to the office, where sat all day; and at noon home and
there find Cosen Roger and Jackson by appointment come to dine
with me, and Creed — and very merry; only, Jackson hath few
words, and like him never the worse for it. We had a great deal of
good discourse at table; and after dinner we four men took coach,
and they set me down at the Old Exchange and they home, having
872
discoursed nothing today with cousin or Jackson about our
business. I to Capt. Cocke’s and there discoursed over our business
of prizes; and Ithink I shall go near to state the matter so as to secure
myself without wrong to him, doing nor saying anything but the
very truth. Thence away to the Strand to my bookseller’s, and there
stayed an hour and bought that idle, roguish book, L’escholle des
Filles; which I have bought in plain binding (avoiding the buying of
it better bound) because I resolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn
it, that it may not stand in the list of books, nor among them, to
disgrace them if it should be found. Thence home, and busy late at
the office; and then home to supper and to bed. My wife well
pleased with my sister’s match, and designing how to be merry at
their marriage. And I am well at ease in my mind to think that that
care will be over.
