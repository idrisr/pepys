Saturday. Mr. Moore and I and several others being invited
today by Mr. Goodman, a friend of his, we dined at the Bull head
upon the best venison pasty that ever I eat of in my life; and with
one dish more, it was the best dinner I ever was at. Here ris in
discourse at table a dispute between Mr. Moore and Dr. Clerke,
the former affirming that it was essentiall to a Tragedy to have the
argument of it true, which the Doctor denyed and left to me to be
judge — and the cause to be determind next Tuesday morning at
the same place upon the eating of the remains of the pasty, and the
loser to spend tos. All this afternoon sending express to the fleet to
order things against my Lord’s coming — and taking direction of
my Lord about some rich furniture to take along with him for the
Princesse.
