Lay long, till Mr. Gawden was gone out, being to takea
little
journy. I took coach and home, finding the town keeping the day
solemly, it being the day of the King’s Murther; and they being at
church, I presently into the church, thinking to see Mrs. Lethulier
or Batelier, but did not—and a dull sermon of our young Lecturer to
boot. This is the first time I have been in this church since I left
London for the plague; and it frighted me indeed to go through the
church, more then I thought it could have done, to see so [many]
graves lie so high upon the churchyard, where people have been
buried of the plague. I was much troubled at it, and do not think to
go through it again-a good while.
