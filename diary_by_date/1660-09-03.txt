About noone, my Lord having taken leave of the King in the
Shield Gallery (where I saw with what kindnesse the King did
hugg my Lord at his parting), I went over with him and saw him
in his Coach at Lambeth and there took leave of him, going to the
Downes. In the afternoon with Mr. Moore to my house to cast up
our Privy Seale accounts, where IJ find that my Lord’s comes to
400 and odd pounds, and mine to 132! — out of which I do give
him as good as 25/ for his pains, with which I doubt he is not
Satisfyed — but my heart is full glad. Thence with him to Mr.
Crews and did fetch as much money as did make even our
accounts between him and I. Home; and there found Mr. Cooke
come back from my Lord for me to get him some things bought
for him to be brought after him ~a toilette Capp and Combe-case
of Silke to make use of in Holland (for he is to go himself to The
Hague) which Iam to do tomorrow morning. This day my father
and my uncle Fenner and both his sons have been at my house to
see it; and my wife did treat them nobly with wine and Anchoves.
By reason of my Lord’s going today I could not get to the office to
meet today.
