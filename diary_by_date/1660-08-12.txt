Lordsday. To my Lord; and with him to Whitehall chapel,
where Mr. Calamy preached and made a good sermon up[on] these
words: ‘“To whom much is given, of him much is required.’ He
was very officious with his three reverences to the King, as others
do. After sermon a brave Anthem of Capt. Cookes, which he
himself sung, and the King was well pleased with it. My Lord dined
at my Lord Chamberlins and I at his house with Mr. Sheply. After
that I went to walk; and meeting Mrs. Lane of Westminster hall, I
took her to my Lord’s and did give her a bottle of wine in the
garden, where Mr. Fairebrother of Cambrige did come and find us
70
and drank with us. After that I took her to my house,’ where I was
exceeding free in dallying with her, and she not unfree to take it. At
night home and called at my father’s, where I found Mr.
Fairebrother; but I did not stay but went homewards and called in at
Mr. Rawlinsons, whither my uncle Wight was coming; and did
come, but was exceeding angry (he beinga little fuddled, and I
think it was that I should see him in that case) as I never saw him in
all my life — which I was somewhat troubled at. Home and to bed.
