Lords day. At dinner and supper, I drank, I know not how, of
my owne accord, so much wine, that I was even almost foxed and
my head aked all night. So home, and to bed without prayers,
which I never did yet since I came to the house of a Sonday night: I
being now so out of order that I durst not read prayers, for fear of
being perceived by my servants in what case I was. So to bed.
