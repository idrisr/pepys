Lords day. Up before 5 a-clock, and alone at setting my
Brampton papers to rights according to my father’s and my
computation and resolution the other day, to my good content. To
dinner with my wife, who not being very well, did not dress herself
but stayed at home all day; and so I to church in the afternoon; and
so home again and up to teach Ashwell the grounds of time and
other things on the Tryangle, and made her take out a psalm very
well, she having a good eare and hand. And soa while to my office
and then home to supper — and prayers, to bed — my wife and I
havingalittle falling-out because I would not leave my discourse
below with her and Ashwell to go up and talk with her alone upon
something she hath to say. She reproached me that Irather talk with
anybody then her — by which Ifind I think she is jealous of my
freedom with Ashwell — which I must avoid giving occasion of.
