Up and all the morning at the office, and at home at dinner;
where after dinner, my wife and I and Deb out by coach to the
Upholster’s in Long lane, Ald. Reeves, and then to Ald. Crow’s, to
see variety of Hangings; and were mightily pleased therewith and
spent the whole afternoon thereupon; and at last, I think we shall
pitch upon the best suit of Apostles, where three pieces for my
room will come to almost 801. So home and to my office, and then
home to supper and to bed.
