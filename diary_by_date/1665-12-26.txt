Up, and to the office, where Sir Jo. Minnes and my Lord
Brouncker and I met, to give our directions to the Comanders of all
the ships in the River to bring in lists of their ships’ companies, with
entries, discharges, &c, all the last voyage— where young Seamour,
among twenty that stood bare, stood with his hat on, a proud saucy
young man. Thence with them to Mr. Cuttles, being invited, and
dined nobly and neatly — with a very pretty house, and a fine Turret
at top, with windeing stairs, and the finest prospect Iknow about all
Greenwich, save the top of the hill— and yet in some respects better
then that. Here J also saw some fine writing-work and Flourishing
of Mr. Hore; he, one that I knew long ago, an acquaintance of Mr.
Tomson’s at Westminster, that is this man’s clerk. It is the stories of
the several Archbishops of Canterbury, engrossed in vellum to
hang up in Canterbury Cathedrall in tables, in lieu of the old ones,
which are almost worn out. Thence to the office a while, and so to
Capt. Cockes and there talked, and home to look over my papers,
and so to bed.
