early up and by Coach (before daylight) to the Wardrobe and
took up Mr. Moore; and he and I to Chelsy to my Lord Privy Seale
and there sealed some things, he being to go out of town for all
Christmas tomorrow. So back again to Westminster; and from
thence by water to the Treasury Office, where I find Sir W. Penn
paying off the Sophia and Griffen and there I stayed with him till
noon; and having sent for some Coller of beef and a minced-pie, we
eat and drank, and so I left him there. So I took Coach; and lighting
at my bookseller’s in Pauls churchyard, I met there with Mr.
Cromlom and the Second Master of Pauls school; and thence I took
them to the Starr and there we sat and talked; and I had great
pleasure in their company, and very glad I was of meeting him so
accidentally, I having omitted too long to go to see him. Here, in
discourse of books, I did offer to give the Schoole what book he
would choose of §/. So we parted; and Ihome and to Mr. Selden and
then to bed.
