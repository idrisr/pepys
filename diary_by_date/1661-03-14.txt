With Sir W. Batten and Pen to Mr. Coventry’s and there hada
dispute about my claime to the place of Pourveyor for Petty
provisions. And at last, to my content did conclude to have my
hand to all the bills for those provisions and Mr. Turner to purvey
them, because I would not have him to lose the place. Then to my
Lord’s; and so with Mr. Creed to an alehouse, where he told me a
long story of his amours at Portsmouth to one of one Mrs. Boates
daughters — which was very pleasant. Dined with my Lord and
Lady; and so with Mr. Creed to the Theatre, and there saw King and
no King, well acted. Thence with him to the Cock-ale house at
Temple barr, where he did aske my advice about his amours and I
did give it him; which was to enquire into the condition of his
competitor, which is a son of Mr. Gawdens; and that I promised to
do for him — and he to make [what] use he can of it to his advantage.
Home and to bed.
