ToDr. Williams, who did carry me into his garden, where he
hath abundance of grapes. And did show me how a dog that he hath
doth kill all the Cattes that come thither to kill his pigeons, and doth
afterwards bury them. And doth it withso much care that they shall
be quite covered, that ifbut the tip of the tail hangs out, he will take
up the cat again and dig the hole deeper— which is very strange. And

I out again, he about his business and I to Dr. Williams to talk with
him again; and he and I walking through Lincolne’s Inn fields,
observed at the Opera a new play, Twelfth night, was acted there,
and the King there. So I, against my own mind and resolution,
could not forbear to go in; which did make the play seem a burthen
to me, and I took no pleasure at all in it. And so after it was done,
went home with my mind troubled for my going thither, after my
swearing to my wife that Iwould never go toa play without her. So
that what with this and things going so crosse to meas to matters of
my uncles estate, makes me very much troubled in my mind. And
so to bed. My wife was with her brother to see his mistress today,
and says she is young, rich, and handsome, but not likely for him to
get.
