Up and walked to the waterside, and thence to Whitehall to
the Duke of York’s chamber; where he being ready, he went to a
Committee of Tanger, where I first understand that my Lord
Sandwich is in his coming back from Spayne, to step over thither to
see in what condition the place is— which I am glad of, hoping that
he will be able to do some good there for the good of the place —
which is so much out of order. Thence to walk a little in
Westminster hall, where the Parliament I find sitting, but spoke
with nobody to let me know what they are doing, nor did Ienquire.
Thence to the Swan and drank, and did besar Frank; and so down
by water back again and to the Exchange a turn or two, only to
show myself; and then home to dinner, where my wife and I had a
small squabble; but I first this day tried the effect of my silence and
not provoking her when she is in an ill humour, and do find it very
good, for it prevents its coming to that heighth on both sides,
which used to exceed what was fit between us. So she became calm
by and by, and fond; and so took coach, and she to the mercer’s to
buy some lace, while I to Whitehall but did nothing; but then to
Westminster hall and took a turn, and so to Mrs. Martins and there
did sit a little and talk and drink and did hazer con her; and so took
coach and called my wife at Unthankes, and so up and down to the
Nursery, where they did not act; then to the New Cockepitt and
896
there missed, and then to Hide parke, where many coaches, but the
Dust so great that it was troublesome; and so by night home, where
to my chamber and finished my pricking out of my song for Mr.
Harris (It is decreed); and soa little supper, being very sleepy and
weary since last night, and so by 10 a-clock to bed — and slept well
all night. This day at noon comes Mr. Pelling to me and shows me
the stone cut lately out of Sir Tho. Adam’s (the old comely
Alderman) body, which is very large endeed, bigger I think then
my fist, and weighs above 25 ounces — and which is very
miraculous, never in all his life had any fit of it, but lived to a great
age without pain, and died at last of something else, without any
sense of this in all his life.
