Great talk there is ofa fear ofawar with the Duch;' and we
have order to pitch upon 20 ships to be forthwith set out; but Ihope
it is but a scarecrow to the world, to let them see that we can be
ready for them; though God knows, the King is not able to set out
five ships at this present without great difficulty, we neither having
money, credit, nor stores. My mind is now in a wonderful
condition of quiet and content, more then ever in all my life — since
my minding the business of my office, which I have done most
constantly; andIfind it to be the very effect of my late oaths against
wine and plays; which, if God please, I will keep constant in. For
now my business is a delight to me and brings me great credit, and
my purse encreases too.
