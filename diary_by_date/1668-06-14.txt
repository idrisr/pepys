S. Up, and walked up and down the town, and sawapretty
good market place, and many good streets, and very fair stone
houses. And so to the great church, and there saw Bp. Montagu’s
tomb; and, when placed, did there see many brave people come,
and, among other, two men brought in, in litters, and set down in
the chancel to hear: but I did not know one face. Here a good
Organ; but a vain, pragmatic fellow preached a ridiculous affected
sermon, that made me angry, and some gent. that sat next me and
sang well. So home, walking round the walls of the city, which are
good, and the battlemts. all whole. The sexton of the church, 1s. So
home to dinner, and after dinner comes Mr. Butts again to see me,
and he and I to church, where the same idle fellow preached; and I
slept most of the sermon. Thence home, and took my wife out and
the girls, and come to this church again, to see it, and look over the
monuments, where, among others, Dr. Venner and Pelling, and a
lady of Sr. W. Waller’s; he lying with his face broken. So to the
fields a little and walked, and then home and had my head looked
[at], and so to supper, and then comes my landlord to me, a sober
understanding man, and did give me a good account of the
antiquity of this town and Wells; and of two heads, on two pillars,
926
in Wells church. But he a catholic. So he gone, I to bed.
