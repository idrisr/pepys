Lady day. To the King’s playhouse, and by and by comes Mr.
Lowder and his wife and mine and into a box forsooth, neither of
them being dressed, which I was almost ashamed of
— Sir W. Penn
and | in the pit; and here saw The Mayden Queene again; which
endeed, the more I see the more I like; and is an excellent play, and
744
so done by Nell her merry part, as cannot be better done in Nature I
think. Thence home, and thereI find letters from my brother which
tell me that yesterday, when he wrote, my mother did rattle in the
throat, so as they did expect every moment her death, which
though I have a good while expected, did much surprize me; yet
was obliged to sup at Sir W. Penn’s, and my wife; and there
counterfeited some little mirth, but my heart was sad; and so home
after supper and to bed, and much troubled in my sleep with dreams
of my being crying by my mother’s bedside, laying my head over
hers and crying, she almost dead and dying, and so waked; but
which is strange, methought she had hair on her face, and not the
same kindof face as my mother really has; but yet did not consider
that, but did weep over her as my mother — whose soul God have
mercy of.
