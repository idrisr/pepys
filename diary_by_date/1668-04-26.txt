Lords day. Lay long, and then up and to church; and so home,
where there came and dined with me Harris, Rolt, and Bannester,
and one Bland, that sings well also; and very merry at dinner; and
after dinner, to sing all the afternoon. But when all was done, I did
begin to think that the pleasure of these people was not worth so
902
often charge and cost to me as it hath occasioned me. They being
gone, I and Balty walked as far as Charing cross, and there got a
coach and to Hales’s the painter, thinking to have found Harris
sitting there for his picture which is drawing for me. But he and all
this day’s company, and Hales, were got to the Crown tavern at
next door; and thither I to them and stayed a minute (leaving Capt.
Grant telling pretty stories of people that have killed themselfs or
been accessory to it, in revenge to other people and to mischief
other people); and thence with Hales to his house and there did see
his beginning of Harris’s picture, which I think will be pretty like,
and he promises a very good picture. Thence with Balty away, and
got a coach and to Hide Parke, and there up and down and did drink
some milk at the Lodge; and so home and to bed.
