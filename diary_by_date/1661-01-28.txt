Atthe office all the morning. Dined at home. And after dinner
to Mr. Crews and thence to the Theatre, where I saw again The Lost
Lady, which doth now please me better then before. And here, I
sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spat backward upon me by a
mistake, not seeing me. But after seeing her to bea very pretty lady,
Iwas not troubled at it at all. This noon Ihad my presse set up in my
chamber for papers to be put in.
