By water to my brother’s and there Ihear my wife is come and
gone home, and my father is come to town also. I walked with him
a little while and left him to lie at that end of the town, and I home-
where methinks I find my wife strange, not knowing, I believe, in
what temper she could expect me to be in; butI fell to kind words
and so we were very kind; only, she could not forbear telling me
how she had been used by them and her maid Ashwell in the
country; but I find it will be best not to examine it, for I doubt she’s
in fault too, and therefore I seek to put it off from my hearing; and
so to bed and there enjoyed her with great content. And so to sleep.
