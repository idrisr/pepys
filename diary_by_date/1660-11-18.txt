Lords day. In the morning to our own church, where Mr.
Powell (a crooke legged man that went formerly with me to Pauls
schoole) preached a good sermon. In the afternoon too to our own
church and my wife with me (the first time that she and my Lady
Battin came to sit in our new pew); and after sermon my Lady took
us home and there we supped with her and Sir W. Batten and Pen
and were much made of-
the first time that ever my wife was there.
So home and to bed.
