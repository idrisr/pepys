Up, and with Sir
J.Mennes by coach to St. James and there
did our business with the Duke; who tells us more and more signs
of a Dutch warr and how we must presently set out a fleet for
Guinny
— for the Dutch are doing so, and there Ibelieve the war will
415
begin. Thence home with him again, in our way he talking of his
cures abroad while he was with the King as a Doctor; and above all
men, the pox. And among others, Sir
J.Denham he told me he had
cured after it was come to an ulcer all over his face to a miracle. By
coach home, calling by the way at Charing cross and there saw the
great Dutchman that is come over, under whose arm I went with
my hat on and could not reach higher then his eyebrows with the tip
of my fingers, reaching as high as I could. He is a comely and well-
made man, and his wife a very little but pretty comely Dutch
woman. It is true he wears pretty high-heeled shoes, but not very
high, and doth generally wear a Turbant, which makes him show
yet taller then he really is, though he is very tall as Ihave said before.
Home to my office, and then to supper, and then to my office again
late, and so home to bed.
