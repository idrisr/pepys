Up very betimes, and my wife also, and got us ready; and
about 8 a-clock, having got some bottles of wine and beer and neat’s
tongues, we went to our barge at the Towre, where Mr. Pierce and
his wife and a kinswoman and his sister, and Mrs. Clerke and her
sister and cousin were to expect us. And so set out for the Hope, all
the way down playing at Cards and other sports, spending our time
pretty merry. Came to the Hope about one, and there showed them
all the ship[s] and had a collacion of anchoves, Gammon &c.; and
after an hour’s stay or more imbarked again for home, and so to
cards and other sports till we came to Greenwich; and there Mrs.
Clerke and my wife and I on shore to an alehouse for them to do
their business, and so to the barge again, having shown them the
King’s pleasure-boat. And so home to the Bridge, bringing night
home with us and it raining hard, but we got them on foot to the
Beare and there put them into a boat; and I back to my wife in the
barge and so to the Tower wharf and home — being very well
pleased today with the company, especially Mrs. Pierce, who
continues her complexion as well as ever, and hath at this day, I
think, the best complexion that ever Isaw on any woman, young or
old, or child either, all days of my life. Also, Mrs. Clerkes
kinswoman sings very prettily, but is very confident in it. Mrs.
Clerke herself witty, but spoils all in being so conceited andmaking
so great a flutter with a few fine clothes and some bad tawdry things
worn with them. But the charge of the barge lies heavy upon me,
which troubles me; but it is but once, and I may make Pierce do me
some courtesy as great. Being come home, I weary to bed with

sitting. The reason of Dr. Clerkes not being here was the King’s
being sick last night and let blood,and so he durst not come away
today.
