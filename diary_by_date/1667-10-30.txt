All the morning, till past noon, preparing over again our
report this afternoon to the committee of Parliament about Tickets,
and then home to eat a bit. And then with Sir W. Penn to Whitehall,
where we did a very little business with the Duke of York at our
usual meeting. Thence to the Parliament house, where after the
Committee was sat, I was called in; and the first thing was upon the
complaint ofa dirty slut that was there, about a ticket which she had
lost and had applied herself to me for another. I did give them a
short and satisfactory answer to that; and so they sent her away, and
were ashamed of their foolery in giving occasion to 500 seamen and
seamen’s wifes to come before them, as there was this afternoon.
But then they fell to the business of tickets; and I did give them the
best answer I could, but had not scope to do it in that methodical
manner which I had prepared myself for; but they did ask a great
many broken rude questions about it, and were mighty hot
whether my Lord Brouncker had any order to discharge whole
ships by ticket; and because my answer was with distinction and not
direct, I did perceive they were not so fully satisfied therewith as I
could wish they were: so my Lord Brouncker was called in, and
they could fasten nothing on him that I could see, nor endeed was
there any proper matter for blame. But Lord, to see that we should
be brought to justify ourselfs in a thing of necessity and profit to the
King, and of no profit or convenience to us, but the contrary.
