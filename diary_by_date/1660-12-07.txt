the Comptroller and Surveyor and went to Whitehall to my Lord’s.
Where Ifind my Lord gone this morning to Huntington —as he told
me yesterday he would. I stayed and dined with my Lady, there
being Loud the Page’s mother there and dined also with us, and
seemed to have been a very pretty woman and of good discourse.
Before dinner I examined Loud in his Latin and find him a very
pretty boy and gone a great way in Latin. So to the Privy Seale,
where signed a deadly number of Pardons, which doth trouble me
to get nothing by. Home by water; and there was much pleased to
see that my little room is likely to come to be finished soon.Ifell a-
