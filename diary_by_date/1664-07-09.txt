Up, and at the office all the morning; in the afternoon by coach
with Sir J. Mennes to Whitehall and there to a Committee for
Fishing; but the first thing was swearing to be true to the Company,
and we were all sworn. But a great dispute we had (which
methought is very Ominous to the Company); some, that we
should swear to be true to the best of our power; and other, to the
best of our understanding; and carried in the last (though in that we
are the least able to serve the Company) because we would not be
obliged to attend the business when we can, but when we list. This
consideration did displease me, but it was voted and so went.
