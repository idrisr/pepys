Up betimes, and knowing that my Lord Sandwich is come to
town with the King and Duke, I to wait upon him; which I did and
find him in very good humour, which I am glad to see with all my
heart. Having received his commands and discoursed with some of
his people about my Lord’s going, and with Sir Rog. Cuttance,
who was there and finds himself slighted by Sir W. Coventry, I
advised him however to look after imployment, lest it be said that
my Lord’s friends do forsake the service after he hath made them
rich with the prizes. I to London, and there, among other things,
did look over some pictures at Cades for my house, and did carry
home a Silver Drudger for my cupboard of plate, and did call for
my silver chafing-dishes, but they are sent home and the man
would not be paid for them, saying that he was paid for them
already, and with much ado got him to tell me, by Mr. Wayth; but I
would not accept of that, but will send him his money, not
knowing any courtesy I have yet done him to deserve it. So home,
and with my wife looked over our plate and picked out 40/ worth I
believe, to change for more useful plate, to our great content; and
then we shall have a very handsome cupboard of plate. So to dinner,
and then to the office, where we had a meeting extraordinary about
stating to the Duke the present debts of the Navy for which ready
money must be had. And that being done, I to my business, where
late; and then home to supper and to bed.
