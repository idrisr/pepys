By Mr. Dugdale I hear the great loss of books in St. Pauls
churchyard, and at their hall’ also — which they value at about
150000]; some booksellers being wholly undone; and among
others, they say, my poor Kirton. And Mr. Crumlum, all his books
and household stuff burned; they trusting to St. Fayths, and the
roof of the church falling, broke the Arch down into the lower
church, and so all the goods burned —a very great loss. His father
hath lost above 1000] in books — one book newly-printed, a
discourse it seems of Courts.
