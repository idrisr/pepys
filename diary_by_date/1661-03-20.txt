The great talk of the towne is the strange eleccion that the City
of London made yesterday for Parliament men — viz., Fowke,
Love, Jones, and [Thompson], men that are so far from being
episcopall that they are thought to be anabaptistes; and chosen with
a great deal of zeale, in spite of the other party that thought
themselfs very strong — crying out in the hall, “noe bishops! noe
Lord Bishops!”’. It doth make people to fear it may come to worse,
by being an example to the countries to do the same. And endeed,
the bishops are so high, that very few do love them.
