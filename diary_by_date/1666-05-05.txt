At the office all the morning. After dinner, upon aletter from
the fleet from Sir W. Coventry, I did doa great deal of work for the
sending away of the victuallers that are in the River &c. — too much
to remember. Till 10 at night busy about letters and other necessary
matters of the office. About 11, I home, it being a fine moonshine;
and so my wife and Mercer came into the garden, and my business
being done, we sang till about 12 at night with mighty pleasure to
ourselfs and neighbours, by their Casements opening. And so
home to supper and to bed.
