Up, and to my Lord Sandwich, who fallows the Duke this
day by water down to the Hope, where the Prince lies. He received
me, busy as he was, with mighty kindness and joy at my
promotions, telling me most largely how the Duke hath expressed
on all occasions his good opinion of my service and love for me. I
paid my thanks and acknowledgment to him; and so back home.
