Lords day. Up, and my wife, poor wretch, still in pain; and
then to dress myself and down to my chamber to settle some
papers; and thither came to me Willet with an errand from her
mistress, and this time I
first did give her a little kiss, she being a
very pretty-humoured girl, and so one that I do love mightily.
Thence to my office and there did a little business; and so to church
— where a dull sermon; and then home and there to dinner, and
Cosen Kate Joyce came and dined with me and Mr. Holliard; but by
chance, I offering occasion to him to discourse of the church of
Rome, Lord, how he run on to discourse with the greatest
vehemence and importunity in the world, as the only thing in the
world that he is full of—and it was good sport to me to see him so
earnest on so little occasion. She came to see us and to tell me that
her husband is going to build his house again, and would borrow of
me 3001; whichI shall upon good security be willing to do, and so
told her, being willing to have some money out of my hands upon
good security. After dinner, up to my wife again, and who is in
great pain still with her tooth and cheek; and there, they gone, I
spent the most of the afternoon and night reading and talking to
bear her company, and so to supper and to bed.
