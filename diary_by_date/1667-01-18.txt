Up, and most of the morning finishing my entry of my
Journall during the late fire out of loose papers into this book,
which did please me mightily when done, I writing till my eyes
were almost blind therewith to make end of it. Then all the rest of
the morning, and after a mouthful of dinner, all the afternoon in my
closet till night, sorting all my papers which have lain unsorted for
all the time we were at Greenwich during the plague. Which did
please me also —I drawing on to put my office into a good posture,
though much is behind.
