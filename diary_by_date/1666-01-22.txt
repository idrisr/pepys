Tothe Crowne tavern behind the Exchange by appointment,
and there met the first meeing of Gresham College since the plague.
Dr. Goddard did fill us with talk in defence of his and his fellow-
physicians’ going out of town in the plague-time; saying that their
perticular patients were most gone out of town, and they left at
liberty — and a great deal more, &c. But what, among other fine
discourse, pleased me most, was Sir G. Ent about Respiration; that
it is not to this day known or concluded on among physicians, nor
to be done either, how that action is managed by nature or for what
use it is. Here late, till poor Dr. Merritt was drunk; and so all home,
and I to bed.
