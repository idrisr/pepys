Up, but weary, and to the office, where we sat all the
357
morning. Before I went to the office there came Bagwell’s wife to
me to speak for her husband. I liked the woman very well and
stroked her under the chin, but could not find in my heart to offer
anything uncivil to her, she being I believe a very modest woman.
At noon with Mr. Coventry to the affrican house, and to my Lord
Peterborough’s business again; and then to dinner, where before
dinner we had the best oysters I have seen this year, and I think as
good in all respects as ever I eat in my life. I eat a great many.
