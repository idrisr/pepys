Lords day. Inthe morning my wife tells me that [her little] bich
hath whelp[ed] four young ones and is very well after it, my wife
having hada great fear that she would die thereof, the dog that got
them being very big. This morning Sir W. Batten, Pen and myself

went to church to the churchwardens to demand a pew, which at
present could not be given us, but we are resolved to have one built.
So we stayed and heard Mr. Mills, a very good Minister. Home to
dinner, where my wife had on her new petticoat that she bought
yesterday, which endeed is a very fine cloth anda fine lace; but that
being ofalight colour and the lace all silver, it makes no great show.
Mr. Creed and my Brother Tom dined with me. After dinner my
wife went and fetched the little puppys to us, which are very pretty
ones. After they were gone, I went up to put my papers in order;
and finding my wife’s clothes lie carelessly laid up, I was angry with
her, which I was troubled for. After that, my wife and I went and
walked in the garden; and so home to bed.
