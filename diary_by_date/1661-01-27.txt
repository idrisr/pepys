Lords day. Before I rose, letters came to me from Portsmouth,
telling me that my Lord Sandwich set sail with the Queene
yesterday from thence for France. To church, leaving my wife now
sick of her menses at home. A poor dull sermon, of a stranger.
Home; and at dinner was very angry at my people’s eating a fine
pudding (made me by Slater the Cooke last Thursday) without my
wife’s leave. To church again; and a good sermon of Mr. Mills.
This day the parson read a proclamacion at church for the keeping
of Wednesday next, the 30th ofJanuary, a fast for the murther of the
late King.
