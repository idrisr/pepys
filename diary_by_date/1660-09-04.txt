Idid many things this morning at home before I went out — as
looking over the Joyners, who are flooring my dining-roome — and
76
doing business with Sir Wms both! at the office. And so to
Whitehall and so to the bull head where we had the remaynes of our
pasty, where I did give my verdict against Mr. Moore upon last
Saturdays wager. Where Dr. Fuller coming in doth confirme me in
my verdict. From thence to my Lord’s and dispatcht Mr. Cooke
away with the things to my Lord. From thence to Axeyard to my
house; where standing at the door, Mrs. Diana comes by, whom I
took into my house upstairs and there did dally with her a great
while, and find that in Latin ‘nulla puella negat.”’ So home by water;
and there sat up late, putting my papers in order and my money
also, and teaching my wife her Musique lesson, in which I take
great pleasure. So to bed.
