Took a glister in the morning and rise in the afternoon. My
wife and I dined ona pullet andI eat heartily — having eat nothing
since Sonday but water-gruel and posset-drink. But must needs say
that our new maid Mary hath played her part very well, in her
readiness and discretion in attending me, of which I am very glad.
