Lords day. Lay long in bed; and then rose and with afire in my
chamber stayed within all day, looking over and settling my
accounts in good order — by examining all my books and the
kitchen books; and I find that though the proper profit of my last
year was but 305], yet I did by other gain make it up 444] — which in
every part of it was unforeseen of me; and therefore it was a strange
oversight for lack of examining my expenses that I should spend
690l this year. But for the time to come, I have so distinctly settled
all my accounts in writing and the perticulars of all my several
layings-out, that I do hopeI shall hereafter make a better judgment
of my spendings then ever. I dined with my wife in her chamber,
she in bed. And then down again and till 11 at night; and broke up
and to bed with great content, but could not make an end of writing
over my vows as I purposed, but I am agreed in everything how to
order myself for the year to come, which I trust in God will be
much for my good. So up to prayers and to bed. This noon Sir W.
Pen came to invite me and my wife against next Wednesday, being
Twelfth-day, to his usual feast, his wedding day.
