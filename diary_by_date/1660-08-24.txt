Office; and then with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Penn to the
parish church to find out a place where to build a seat or a gallery to
sit in; and did find one, which is to be done speedily. Thence with
them to dinner at a tavern in Thames street, where they were
invited to a roasted haunch of venison and other very good victuals
and company. Thence to Whitehall to the Privy Seale, but nothing
to do. At night by land to my father’s, where I found my mother
not very well. I did give her a pint of sack. My father came in and
Dr. T. Pepys, who talked with me in French a great while about
looking out of a place for him. But I find him a weak man and
1. Robert Bowyer had been Pepys’s ‘father’ in the Exchequer —i.e. the senior
official under whom Pepys and his brother clerks worked.

speaks the worst French that ever I heard of one that hath been so
long beyond sea. Thence into Paul’s churchyard and bought
Barkley’s Argenis in Latin; and so home and to bed. I find at home
that Capt. Bun hath sent me four dozen bottles of wine to me today.
The King came back to Whitehall tonight.
