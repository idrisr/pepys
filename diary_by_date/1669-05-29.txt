The King’s birth day. To Whitehall, where all very gay; and
perticularly, the Prince of Tuscany very fine, and is the first day of
his appearing out of morning since he came. I heard the Bishop of
Peterborough preach, but dully; but a good anthem of Pelham’s.
Home to dinner, and then with my wife to Hyde park, where all the
evening great store of company, and great preparations by the
Prince of Tuscany to celebrate the night with fireworks for the
King’s birthday; and so home.
