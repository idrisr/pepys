Up betimes; and it being a frosty morning, walked on foot to
Whitehall, but not without some fears of my pain coming. At
Whitehall I hear and find that there was the last night the greatest
Tide that ever was remembered in England to have been in this
River — all Whitehall having been drowned — of which there was
great discourse. Anon we all met, and up with the Duke and did our
business; and by and by my Lord of Sandwich came in, but whether
it be my doubt or noI cannot tell, but I do not find that he made any
sign of kindness or respect to me, which troubles me more then
anything in the world.
