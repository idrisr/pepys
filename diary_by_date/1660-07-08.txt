Lords day. To Whitehall to chapel, where I got in with ease by
going before the Lord Chancellor with Mr. Kipps. Here I heard
very good Musique, the first time that I remember ever to have
heard the Organs and singing-men in Surplices in my life. The
Bishop of Chichester preached before the King and made a great
flattering sermon, which I did not like that clergy should meddle
with matters of state. Dined with Mr. Luellin and Salsbury at a
cook’s shop. Home, and stayed all the afternoon with my wife till
after sermon; there till Mr. Fairebrother came to call us out to my
father’s to supper. He told me how he had perfectly procured me to
be made Maister in arts by proxy — which did somewhat please me,
though I remember my Cosen Rogr. Pepys was the other day
dissuading me from it. While we were at supper came W. Howe to
supper to us. And after supper went home to bed.
