Lords day. In the forenoon I alone to our church. And after
oF,
dinner I went and ranged about to many churches. Among the rest,
to the Temple, where I heard Dr. Wilkins a little (late maister of
Trinity in Cambrige); and that being done, to my father’s to see my
mother, who is troubled much with the Stone. And that being
done, I went home. So to supper and to bed.
