All the morning at home — Mr. Berchenshaw, by appoint-
ment yesterday, coming to me, and begun composition of
Musique. And he being gone, Ito settle my papers and things in my
chamber; and so after dinner, in the afternoon to the office and
thence to my chamber about several businesses of the office and my
own; and then to supper and to bed. This day my brave vellum
covers to keep pictures in came in, which pleases me very much.
