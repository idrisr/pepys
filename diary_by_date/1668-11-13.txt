All the evening with my wife, who tells me that Deb hath
been abroad today, and is come home and says she hath got a place
to go to, so as she will be gone tomorrow morning. This troubled
me; and the truth is, I have a great mind for to have the maidenhead
of this girl, which I should not doubt to have if yo could get time
para be con her — but she will be gone and I know not whither.
Before we went to bed, my wife told me she would not have me to
see her or give her her wages; and so | did give my wife rol for her
year and half-a-quarter’s wages, which she went into her chamber
and paid her; and so to bed, and there, blessed be God, we did sleep
well and with peace, which I had not done in now almost twenty
nights together. This afternoon I went to my coachmaker and
Crows, and there saw things go on to my great content.
