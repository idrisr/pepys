Up; and going outof doors, I understand that Sir W. Batten is
gone to bed on a sudden again this morning, being struck very ill.
AndI confess Ihave observed him for these last two months to look
very ill and to look worse and worse. I to St. James’s (though it be a
sitting day) to the Duke of York about [the] Tanger Committee,
which met this morning; and he came to us, and the charter for the
city of Tanger was read and the form of the Court Merchant.
