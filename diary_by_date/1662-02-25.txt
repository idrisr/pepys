All the morning at the office. At noon with Mr. Moore to the
Coffee-house — where among other things, the great talk was of the
effects of this late great wind; and I heard one say that he hath five
great trees standing together blown down, and going to lop them —
one of them, as soon as the lops were cut off, did by the weight of
the root rise again and fasten. We have letters from the Forrest of
Deane, that above 1000 oakes and as many beeches are blown down
in one walke there. And letters from my father tells me of 20 hurt to
us down at Brampton.
