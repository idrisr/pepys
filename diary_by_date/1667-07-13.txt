Up pretty betimes, it being mighty hot weather and I lying
this night (which I have not doneI believe since a boy; I am sure not
since before I had the stone before)with only a rugg and sheet upon
me. To my chamber, and my wife up to do something and by
chance we fell out again; but I to the office, and there we did at the
board much business, though the most was the dividing of so00l
(which the Lords Comissioners have with great difficulty found
upon our letter to them this week that would have required s0000/)
among a great many occasions. After rising, my Lord Anglesy, this
being the second time of his being with us, did take me aside and
asked me where I lived, because he would be glad to have some
discourse with me. This I liked well enough, and told him I would
wait upon him, which I will do; and so all broke up, and I home to
dinner, where Mr. Pierce dined with us; who tells us what troubles
me, that my Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away from the King’s
House, lies with her, and gives her rool a year, so as she hath sent
806
her parts to the House and will act no more. And yesterday Sir Tho.
Crew told me that Lacy lies a-dying of the pox, and yet hath his
whore by him; whom he will have to look on, he says, though he
can do no more; nor would receive any ghostly advice from a
Bishop, an old acquaintance of his that went to see him. He says
there is a strangeness between the King and my Lady Castlemayne,
as I was told yesterday.
