With the two Sir Wms to the Trinity house; and there in their
society had the business debated of Sir Nicholas Crisps Sasse at
Deptford. Then to dinner; and after dinner I was sworne a younger
Brother, Sir W. Rider being Deputy-Maister for my Lord of
Sandwich; and after I was sworn, all the elder Brothers shake me by
the hand; it is their Custome it seems. Thence to the office, and so to
Sir Wm. Battens all three; and there we stayed till late, talking
together in complaint of the Treasurers instruments — above all,
Mr. Waith — at whose child’s christening our wifes and we should
have been today, but none of them went and I am glad of it — for he
is a very rogue. So home and drew up our report for Sir N. Crisp’s
Sasse, and so to bed.
