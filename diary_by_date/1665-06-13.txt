Up, and to the office, where all the morning doing business.
At noon with Sir G. Carteret to my Lord Mayors to dinner, where
much company in a little room — and though a good, yet no
extraordinary Table. His name, Sir John Lawrence — whose father,
a very ordinary old man, sat there at table — but it seems a very rich
man. [Ald. Sir Richard Browne] did here openly tell in boasting,
how he had, only upon suspicion of disturbances (ifthere had been
any bad news from sea), clapped up several persons that he was
afeared of. And that he had several times done the like and would
do, and take no bail where he saw it unsafe for the King.
