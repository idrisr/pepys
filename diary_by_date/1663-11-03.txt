Up and to the office, where busy all the morning; and at noon
to the Coffee-house and there heard a long and most passionate
discourse between two Doctors of Physique (of which one was Dr.
Allen, whom I knew at Cambrige) and a Couple of Apothecarys;
these maintaining Chymistry against their Galenicall physic; and
the truth is, one of the Apothecaries, whom they charged most, did
speak very prettily; that is, his language and sense good, though
perhaps he might not be so knowing a physician as to offer to
contest with them. I home; and by and by comes Chapman the
periwig-maker, and [upon] my liking it, without more ado I went
up and there he cut off my haire; which wentalittle to my heart at
present to part with it, but it being over and my periwig on, I paid
him 31 for it; and away went he with my own hair to make up
another of: and I by and by, after I had caused all my maids to look
upon it and they conclude it to become me, though Jane was
mightily troubled for my parting with my own hair and so was
Besse —I went abroad to the Coffee-house; and coming back, went
to Sir W. Penn and there sat with him and Capt. Cocke till late at
night, Cocke talking of some of the Roman history very well, he
having a good memory. To supper and thena
little to my viall, and
afterward with my wife to her Arithmetique, and so to bed.
