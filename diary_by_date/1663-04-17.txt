Up by 5 a-clock, as I have long done, and to my office all the
morning; at noon home to dinner with my father with us. Our
dinner, it being Goodfriday, was only sugar sopps and fish; the only
time that we have had a Lenten dinner all this Lent. This morning
Mr. Hunt the instrument-maker brought me home a Basse viall to
see whetherI
like it, which I do not very well; besides, Iam under a
doubt whether Ihad best buy one yet or no— because of spoiling my
present mind and love to business. After dinner my father and I
walked into the Citya little and parted; and I to Pauls churchyard to
cause the title of my English Mare Clausum to be changed and the
new title, dedicated to the King, to be put to it, because I am
ashamed to have the other seen dedicate[d] to the Commonwealth.
So home and to my office till night; and so home to talk with my
father, and sup and to bed —I having not had yet one Quarter of an
hour’s leisure to sit down and talk with him since he came to towne.
Nor do I know till the holidays when I shall.
