Lords day. Up, and to church in the best manner I have gone a
good while; that is to say, with my wife and her woman Mercer
along with us and Thom my boy waiting on us. A dull sermon.
Home; dined. Left my wife to go to church alone; and I walked in
haste, being late, to the Abby at Westminster according to promise
to meet Jane Welsh; and there wearily walked, expecting her till 6 a-
424
clock from 3. But no Jane came, which vexed me. Only, part of it I
spent with Mr. Blagrave walking in the Abbey, he telling me the
whole government and discipline of Whitehall chapel and the
caution now used against admitting any debauched persons — which
I was glad to hear, though he tells me there are persons bad enough.
Thence, going home, went by Gervas’s; and there stoodJane at the
door, and so I took her in and drank with her, her maister and
mistress being out of door. She told me how she could not come to
me this afternoon, but promised another time. So I walked home,
contented with my speaking with her, and walked to my uncle
Wights, where they were all at supper; and among others, fair Mrs.
Margtt Wight, who endeed is very pretty. So after supper home to
prayers and to bed. This afternoon, it seems, Sir
J.Minnes fell sick
at church; and going down the gallery stairs, fell down dead; but
came to himself again and is pretty well.
