This morning in bed my wife tells me of our being robbed of
our silver tankard; which vexed me all day for the negligence of my
people to leave the door open. To the office all the afternoon; which
is a great pleasure to me again —to talk with persons of Quality and
to be in command; andI gave it out among them that the estate left
me is 200/ a year in land, besides money — because I would put an
esteem upon myself. At night home and to bed, after Ihad set down
my Journall ever since my going from London this journy, to this
houre. This afternoon I hear that my man Will hath lost his cloak
with my tankard, at which I am very glad.
