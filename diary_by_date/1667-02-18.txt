Up, and to my bookbinders and there mightily pleased to see
some papers of the account we did give the Parliament of the
expense of the Navy, sewed together; which I could not have
conceived before how prettily it was done. Then by coach to the
Exchequer about some tallies; and thence back again home, by the
way meeting Mr. Weaver of Huntington, and did discourse our
business of law together; which did ease my mind, for I was afeared
Ihave omitted the doing what Iin prudence ought to have done. So
home and to dinner; and after dinner to the office, where yo had
Mrs. Burrows all sola a my closet, and did there besar and tocar su
mamelles as much as yo quisere hasta a hazer me hazer, but ella
would not suffer that yo should poner mi mano abaxo ses jupes,
which yo endeavoured. Thence away, and with my wife by coach
to the Duke of York’s playhouse, expecting a new play; so stayed
not no more then other people, but to the King’s to The Mayds
Tragedy; but vexed all the while with two talking ladies and Sir Ch.
Sidly, yet pleased to hear their discourse, he being a stranger; and
one of the ladies would, and did, sit with her mask on all the play;
and being exceeding witty as ever I heard woman, did talk most
pleasantly with him; but was, I believe, a virtuous woman and of
quality. He would fain know who she was, but she would not tell.
Yet did give him many pleasant hints of her knowledge of him, by
728
that means setting his brains at work to find out who she was; and
did give him leave to use all means to find out who she was but
pulling off her mask. He was mighty witty; and she also making
sport with him very inoffensively, that a more pleasant rencontre I
never heard. But by that means lost the pleasure ofthe play wholly,
to which now and then Sir Ch. Sidlys exceptions against both
words and pronouncing was very pretty. So home and to the office;
did much business; then home to supper and to bed.
