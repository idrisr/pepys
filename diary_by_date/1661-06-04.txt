To my Lord Crew’s to dinner with him. And had very good
discourse about having of young noblemen and gentlemen to think
of going to sea, as being as honourable service as the land war. And
among other things, told us how in Queen Elisabeth’s times, young
noblemen would wait with a trencher at the back of another till he is
come to age himself. And witnessed in my Lord, young Lord of
Kent that then was, who waited upon my Lord Bedford at table,
when a
letter came to my Lord Bedford that the Earldome of Kent
was fallen to his servant, the young Lord; and so rose from table and
made him sit down in his place, and took a lower for himself—for so
he was by place to sit. From thence to the theatre and saw Harry the
Fourth, a good play. That done, I went over the water and walked
over the fields to Southworke; and so home and to my lute. At
night to bed.
