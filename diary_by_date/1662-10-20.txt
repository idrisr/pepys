With Comissioner Pett to Mr. Lillys the great painter, who
came forth to us; but believing that I came to bespeak a picture, he
prevented us by telling us that he should not be at leisure these
three weeks, which methinks is a rare thing; and then to see in
what pomp his table was laid for himself to go to dinner. And here
among other pictures, I saw the so much by me desired picture of
my Lady Castlemayne, which is a most blessed picture and that
that I must have a copy of.
