To the Wardrobe — where, discoursing with my Lord, he did
instruct me as to the business of the wardrobe, in case in his absence
Mr. Townsend should die; and told me that he doth intend to joyne
me and Mr. Moore with him as to that business, now he is going to
sea. And spoke to me many other things, as to one that he doth put
the greatest confidence in - of which Iam proud. Here Ihavea good
occasion to tell him (what I have had long in my mind) that since it
hath pleased God to bless me with something, I am desirous to lay
out something for my father, and so have pitched upon Mr. Yong’s
placein the wardrobe
— which I desired he would give order in his
absence if the place should fall, that I might have the refusal of —
which my Lord did freely promise me. At which I was very glad —
he saying that he would do that at the least. So I saw myLord in the
barge going to Whitehall; and I and Mr. Creed home to my house,
whither my father and my Cosen Scott came to dine with me. And
so we dined together very well, and before we had done, in comes
my father Bowyer and my mother! and four daughters, and there
stayed all the afternoon — which cost me great store of wine and
were very merry. By and by I am called to the office, and there
stayeda
little. So home again and took Mr. Creed and left them; and
so he andI to the Tower to speak for some ammunicion for ships for
1. Wife of ‘father’ Bowyer: cf. above, p. 73 (23 August) & n.
138
my Lord. And so he and I with much pleasure walked quite round
the tower, which Inever did before. So home; and after a walk with
my wife upon the leads, I and she went to bed.
