By the morning we were come close to the land and
everybody made ready to get on shore. The King and the two
Dukes did eat their breakfast before they went, and there being set
some Shipps diet before them, only to show them the manner of the
Shipps diet, they eat of nothing else but pease and pork and boiled
beef. I spoke with the Duke of York about business, who called me
Pepys by name, and upon my desire did promise me his future
favour. Great expectation of the King’s making some Knights, but
there was none. About noon (though the Brigantine that Beale
made was there ready to carry him), yet he would go in my Lord’s
barge with the two Dukes; our captain steered, and my Lord went
along bare with him. Iwent, and Mr. Mansell and one of the King’s
footmen, with a dog that the King loved (which shit in the boat,
which made us laugh and me think that a King and all that belong to
him are but just as others are) went in a boat by ourselfs; and so got
on shore when the King did, who was received by Gen. Monke
with all imaginable love and respect at his entrance upon the land at
Dover. Infinite the Croud of people and the gallantry of the
Horsmen, Citizens, and Noblemen of all sorts. The Mayor of the
town came and gave him his white staffe, the badge of his place,
50
which the King did give him again. The Mayor also presented him
from the town a very rich Bible, which he took and said it was the
thing that he loved above all things in the world. A Canopy was
provided for him to stand under, which he did; and talked awhile
with Gen. Monke and others; and so into a stately coach there set
for him; and so away straight through the towne toward Canter-
bury without making any stay at Dover. The Shouting and joy
expressed by all is past imagination.
