Up and by coach to Whitehall; and there in the long matted
gallery I find Sir G. Carteret, Sir
J.Mennes, and Sir W. Batten; and
by and by comes the King to walk there, with three or four with
him; and as soon as he saw us, “‘Oh,”’ says he, “here is the Navy
Office,” and there walked twenty turns the length of the gallery —
talking methought but ordinary talk. By and by came the Duke,
and he walked and at last went into the Duke’s lodgings. The King
stayed so long that we could not discourse with the Duke, and so
we parted. I heard the Duke say that he was going to wear a
perriwigg; and they say the King also will. I never till this day
observed that the King is mighty gray.
