Up, and with Sir W. Batten to Whitehall, where mighty
thrusting about the Duke, now upon his going. We were with him
long; he advised us to fallow our business close and to be directed in
his absence by the committee of the Councell for the Navy. By and
by a meeting of the Fishery, where the Duke was; but in such haste,
and things looked so superficially over, that I had not afit
opportunity to propose my paper that I wrote yesterday; but I had
showed it to Mr. Gray and Wren before, who did like it most highly
as they said, and I think they would not dissemble in that manner in
a business of this nature. But I see the greatest businesses are done so
superficially, that I wonder anything succeeds at all among us that is
public.
