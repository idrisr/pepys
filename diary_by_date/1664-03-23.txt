To the office, where very busy all the morning; and so to the
Change and off thence with Sir W. Ryder to the Trinity house and
there dined very well. And good discourse among the old men — of
Islands now and then rising and falling again in the sea; and that
369
there is many dangers of grounds and rocks that come just up to the
edge almost of the sea, that is never discovered and ships perish
without the world’s knowing the reason of it. Among other things,
they observed that there are but two seamen in the Parliament
house, viz., Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen — and not above 20 or 30
merchants; which is a strange thing in an Island, and no wonder that
things of trade go no better nor are better understood. Thence
home and all the afternoon at the office; only, for an hour in the
evening my Lady Jemimah, Paulina, and Madam Pickering came to
see us; but my wife would not be seen, being unready. Very merry
with them, they mightily talking of their thrifty living for a
fortnight before their mother came to town and other such simple
talk, and of their merry life at Brampton at my father’s this winter.
So they being gone, to the office again till late; and so home and to
supper and bed.
