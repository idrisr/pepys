Late to bed. About 3 in the morning there was great knocking
at my cabin, which with much difficulty (as they say) waked me
and I rise; but it was only for a packet, so I went to my bed again.
And in the morning gave it my Lord. This morning Capt. Isham
comes on board to see my Lord and drink his wine before he went
into the Downes; there likewise came many merchants to get
convoy to the Baltique, which a course was taken for. They dined
with my Lord, and one of them, by name Ald. Wood, talked much
to my Lord of the hopes that we have now to be settled (under the
King he meant); but my Lord took no notice of it. At night busy a-
writing, and so to bed. My heart exceeding heavy for not hearing of
my dear wife; and indeed, I do not remember that ever my heart
was so apprehensive of her absence as at this very time.
