Up, and enter all my Journall since the 28th of October,
having every day’s passage well in my head, though it troubles me
to remember it; and what I was forced to, being kept from my
lodging, where my books and papers are, for several days. So to my
office — where, till 2 or 3 a-clock, busy before I could go to my
lodging to dinner. Then did it, and to my office again. In the
evening news is brought me my wife is come; so I to her, and with
her spent the evening, but with no great pleasure, I being vexed
about her putting away of Mary in my absence; but yet I took no
notice of it at all — but fell into other discourse; and she told me,
having herself been this day at my house at London (which was
boldly done) to see Mary have her things, that Mr. Harrington our
neighbour, and East Country merchant, is dead at Epsum of the
plague. And that another neighbour of ours, Mr. Hallworthy, a
very able* man, is also dead, bya fall in the country from his horse,
his foot hanging in the stirrup and his brains beat out. Here we sat
talking; and after supper, to bed.
