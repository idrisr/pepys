Busy all the morning in my chamber in my old cloth suit,
while my usual one is to my tailor’s to mend; which I had at noon
again, and an answer toa letter I had sent this morning to Mrs.
Pierce to go along with my wife and I down to Greenwich tonight,
upon an invitation to Mr. Boreman’s to be merry, to dance and sing
with Mrs. Knipp. Being dressed and having dined, Itook coach and
to Mrs. Pierce, to her new house in Covent garden, a very fine place
and fine house. Took her thence home to my house, and so by
water to Boremans by night — where the greatest disappointment
that ever Isaw in my life: much company —a good supper provided,
and all come with expectation of excess of mirth; but all blank
through the waywardnesse of Mrs. Knipp, who, though she had
appointed the night, could not be got to come -— not so much as her
husband could get her to come; but, which was a pleasant thing in
all my anger — I asking him (while we were in expectation what
$74
answer one of our many messengers would bring) what he
thought, whether she would come or no, he answered that for his
part he could not so much as think. By and by we all to supper,
which the silly maister of the feast commanded; but what with my
being out of humour, and the badness of the meat dressed, I did
never eat a worse supper in my life. At last, very late and supper
done, she came undressed; but it brought me no mirth at all; only,
after all being done, without singing, or very little, and no dancing
— Pierce and I to bed together; and he and I very merry to find how
little and thin clothes they give us to cover us, so that we were fain
to lie in our stockings and drawers and lay all our coats and clothes
upon the bed. So to sleep.
