To my Lord Crews and there did stay with him an hour
discoursing about the ill state of my Lord Sandwich, that he can
neither be got to be called home nor money got to maintain him
there, which will ruin his family: and the truth is, he doth almost
deserve it, for by all relation he hath ina little more then a year anda
half spent 20000! of the King’s money and the best part of 10000 of
his own; which is a most prodigious expense, more then ever
Embassadors spent there and more then these Commissioners of
the Treasury will or do allow; and they demand an account before
they will give him any more money; which puts all his friends to a
loss what to answer — but more money we must get him, or to be
called home. So home, and there to see Sir W. Batten, who fell sick
yesterday morning. He is asleep and so I could not see him; but in an
hour after, word is brought me that he is so ill, that it is believed he
cannot live till tomorrow; which troubles me and my wife
mightily, partly out of kindness, he being a good neighbour, and
partly because of the money he owes me. So home and to supper
and to bed.
