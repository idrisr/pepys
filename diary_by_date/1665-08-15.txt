Up by 4 a-clock and walked to Greenwich, where called at
Capt. Cockes and to his chamber, he being in bed — where
something put my last night’s dream into my head, whichI think is
the best that ever was dreamed — which was, that I had my Lady
Castlemayne in my armes and was admitted to use all the dalliance I
desired with her, and then dreamed that this could not be awake but
that it was only a dream. But that since it was a dream and that I
took so much real pleasure in it, what a happy thing it would be, if
when we are in our graves (as Shakespeere resembles it), we could
dream, and dream but such dreams as this — that then we should not
need to be so fearful of death as we are this plague-time.
