Lords day. Lay long, talking with my wife. Then up and Mr.
Holliard came to me and let me blood, about 16 ounces, I being
exceeding full of blood, and very good. Ibegun to be sick; but lying
upon my back, I was presently well again and did give him $s. for
his pains; and so we parted. AndI to my chamber to write down my
Journall from the beginning of mylate Journy to this houre. Dined
well. And after dinner, my arm tied up with a black ribbon, I
walked with my wife to my Brother Toms, our boy waiting on us
with his sword, which this day he begins to wear to out-do Sir W.
Pens boy, who this day, and Sir W. Batten[’s] too, begin to wear
new liverys. But I do take mine to be the neatest of them all.
