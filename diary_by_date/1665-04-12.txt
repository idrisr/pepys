Dined at home; and thence to Whitehall again (where I lose
most of my time nowadays, to my great trouble, charge, and loss of
time and benefit) and there, after the Council rose, Sir G. Carteret,
my Lord Brunkard, Sir Tho. Harvy, and myself down to my Lord
Treasurer’s chamber to him and the Chancellor and the Duke of
Albemarle. And there I did give them a large account of the charge
of the Navy, and want of money. But strange, to see how they held
up their hands, crying, ‘““What shall we do?” Says my Lord
Treasurer, ““Why, what means all this, Mr. Pepys? This is true, you
say, but what would you have me to do? I have given all I can for
my life. Why will not people lend their money? Why will they not
trust the King as well as Oliver? Why do our prizes come to
481
nothing, that yielded so much heretofore?” And this was all we
could get, and went away without other answer. Which is one of
the saddest things, that at such a time as this, with the greatest
action on foot that ever was in England, nothing should be minded,
but let things go on of themselfs — do as well as they can. So home,
vexed. And going to my Lady Battens, there found a great many
women with her in her chamber, merry — my Lady Pen and her
daughter, among others; where my Lady Pen flung me down upon
the bed, and herself and others, one after another, upon me, and
very merry we were; and thence Ihome and called my wife with my
Lady Pen to supper, and very merry as I could be, being vexed as I
was. So home to bed. |
