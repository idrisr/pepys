Up before 4 a-clock; and after some business, took Will forth
and he and I walked over the Tower hill through St. Catharines and
Ratcliffe (Ithink it is) by the waterside above a mile before we could
get a boat; and so over the water in a Scull (which I have not done a
great while) and walked finally to Deptford, where I saw in what
forwardness the work is for Sir W. Battens house and mine,’ and it
is almost ready. I also, with Mr. Davis, did view my Cosen Joyces
tallow and compared it with the Irish tallow we bought lately; and
find ours much more white, but as soft as it; now what is the fault,
or whether it be or no a fault, [know not. So walked home again as
far as over against the tower, and so over and home — where I
find
Sir W. Penn andSir John Minnes discoursing about Sir
J.Mennes
house and his coming to live with us; and I think he entends to have
Mr. Turners house and he to come to his lodgings, which I shall be
very glad of. We three did go to Mr. Turners to view his house,
which I think was to the end that Sir
J.Mennes might see it. Then
by water with my wife to the Wardrobe and dined there; and in the
afternoon with all the children by water to Greenwich, where |
showed them the King’s Yacht, the house and the parke, all very
pleasant; and so to the taverne and had the Musique of the house,
and so merrily home again; Will and I walked home from the
Wardrobe, having left my wife at the tower wharf coming by —
whomIfind gone to bed not very well, she having her month’s
upon her. So to bed.
