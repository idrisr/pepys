Lords day. To church myself, after seeing everything fitted for
dinner. And so after church, home; and thither comes Mrs. Batelier
and her two daughters to dinner to us, and W. Hewer and his
mother, and Mr. Spong. We were very civilly merry, and Mrs.
Battelier a very discreet woman, but mighty fond in the stories she
tells of her son Will. After dinner, Mr. Spong and I to my closet,
there to try my instrument Paralellogramm, which doth mighty
well, to my full content; but onlya
little stiff, as being new. Thence,
taking leave of my guests, he andI and W. Hewer to Whitehall; and
there parting with Spong, a man that I mightily love for his
plainness and ingenuity — I into the Court, and there up and down
and spoke with my Lord Bellasses and Peterbrough about the
business now in dispute, about my deputing a Treasurer to pay the
garrison at Tanger; which I would avoid and not be accountable,
and they will serve me therein. Here I met Hugh May, and he
brings me to the knowledge of Sir Harry Capell, a Member of
Parliament and brother of my Lord of Essex, who hatha
great value
it seems for me; and they appoint a day to come and dine with me
and see my books and papers of the office; whichI shall be glad to
show them and have opportunity to satisfy them therein. Here, all
the discourse is that now the King is of opinion to have the Par-
liament called, notwithstanding his late resolutions for the pro-
roguing them; so unstable are his counsels, and those about him.
So staying late talking in the Queen’s side, Iaway with W. Hewer
home; and there to read and talk with my wife, and so to bed.
