Having directed it last night, I was called up this morning
before 4 a-clock. It was full light, enough to dress myself; and so by
water against tide, it beinga little coole, to Greenewich and thence
(only that it was somewhat foggy till the sun got to some heighth)
walked with great pleasure to Woolwich, in my way staying several
times to listen to the nightingales. I did much business [and]
discovered a plain cheat, which in time I shall publish, of Mr.
Ackeworths. Thence, having visited Mr. Falconer also, who lies
still sick but hopes to be better, I walked to Greenwich, Mr. Deane
with me. Much good discourse, and I think him a very just man;
only,a little conceited, but yet very able in his way. And so he by
water with me also to town. I home, and immediately dressing
myself, by coach with my wife to my Lord Sandwiches; but they
having dined, we would not light but went to Mrs. Turners and
there got something to eat; and thence, after reading part of a good
play, Mrs. The[oph]., my wife and I in their coach to Hide parke,
where great plenty of gallants. And pleasant it was, only for the
dust. Here I saw Mrs. Bendy, my Lady Spillman’s fair daughter
that was, who continues yet very handsome. Many others I saw,
379
with great content. And so back again to Mrs. Turners, and then
took a coach and home. I did also carry them into St. James’s park
and showed them the garden. To my office awhile while supper
was making ready, and so home to supper and to bed.
