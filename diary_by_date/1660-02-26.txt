Sunday. My brother went to the college to Chappell. My
father and I went out in the morning and walk out in the fields
behind King’s College and in King’s College chapel yard; and there
21
we met with Mr. Fayrbrother. Who took us to Butolphes Church,
where we heard Mr. Nicolas of Queen’s College (who I knew in
my time to be Tripos with great applause) upon this text: “For thy
commandments are broad.’’ Thence my father and I to Mr.
Widdrington’s chamber to dinner, where he used us very cour-
teously again and had two fellow-commoners at table with him,
and Mr. Pepper, a fellow of the college. After that we broke up; and
my father, Mr. Zanch[y] and I to my Cosen Angiers to supper,
where I caused two bottles of wine to be carried from the Rose
tavern; but was drank up, and I had not the wit to let them know at
table that it was I that paid for them, and so I lost my thanks for
them. So to my Inn, where, after I had wrote a note and enclosed
the certificate to Mr. Widdrington, I bade good-night to my father;
and John went to bed but I stayed upa little while, playing the fool
with the lass of the house at the door of the chamber; and so to bed.
