The weather still very rainy. By coach to London, and took a
short melancholly leave of my father and mother, without having
time to drink or say anything of business one to another; and
endeed, Ihad a fear upon me that Ishould scarce ever see my mother
again, she having a great cold then upon her. Then to Westminster,
where by reason of rain and an Easterly wind, the water was so high
that there was boats rowed in King streete and all our yard was
drownded, that one could not go to my house, so as no man hath
seen the like almost. Most houses full of water.
