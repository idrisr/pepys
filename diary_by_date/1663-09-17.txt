Up; and my father being gone to bed ill last night, and
continuing so this morning, I was forced to come to a new
consideration, whether it was fit for to let my uncle [Thomas] and
his son go to Wisbeech about my uncle Days estate alone or no, and
concluded it unfit and so resolved to go with them myself; and so
leaving my wife there, I begun ajourny with them; and with much
ado through the Fens, along Dikes, where sometimes we were
ready to have our horses sink to the belly, we got by night, with
great deal of stir and hard riding, to Parsons drove, a heathen place—
where I found my uncle and aunt Perkins and their daughters, poor
wretches, ina sad poor thatched cottage, like a poor barne or stable,
peeling of Hemp (in which I did give myself good content to see
their manner of preparing of hemp) and in a poor condition of
habitt; took them to our miserable Inne and there, after long stay
and hearing of Franke their son, the miller, play upon his Treble (as
he calls it), with which he earnes part of his living, and singing of a
country bawdy song, we set down to supper: the whole Crew and
Frankes wife and children (asad company, of which I was ashamed)
supped with us. And after supper, I talking with my aunt about her
report concerning my uncle Days Will and surrender, I find her in
such different reports from what she writes and says to other
309
people, and short of what I expected, that I fear little will be done of
good in it. By and by news is brought us that one of our horses is
stole out of the Stable; which proves my uncles, at which I was
inwardly glad; I mean, that it was not mine. And at this we were at a
great loss; and they doubting a person that lay at next door, a
Londoner, some lawyer’s clerk, we caused him to be secured in his
bed and made care to be taken to seize the horse; and so, about 12 at
night or more, to bed ina sad, cold, nasty chamber; only, the maid
was indifferent handsome, and so I hada kiss or two of her, and I to
bed. Andalittle after Iwas asleep, they waked me to tell me that the
horse was found, which was good news; and so to sleep till the
morning — but was bit cruelly (and nobody else of our company,
which I wonder at) by the gnatts.
