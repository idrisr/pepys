Nothing to doat our office. Iwent with my wife and left her at
market, and went myself to the Coffee-house and heard exceeding
good argument against Mr. Harrington’s assertion that over-
balance of propriety* was the foundation of government. Home
and wrote to Hinchingbrooke, and sent that and my other letters
that missed of going on Thursday last. So to bed.
