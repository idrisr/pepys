Lords day. Rose betimes, and to my office till church-time to
write two copies of my Will fair, bearing date this day. Wherein I
have given my sister Pall 500/ — my father, for his own and my
mother’s support, 2000] — to my wife, the rest of my estate; but to
have 2500! secured to her though, by deducting out of what I have
given my father and my sister. I despatched all before church-time,
and then home and to church, my wife with me. Thence home to
dinner, whither came my uncle Wight and aunt and uncle Norbury
—and Mr. Sheply. A good dinner, and very merry. After dinner we
broke up, andI by water to Westminster to Mrs. Martin’s and there
sat with her and her husband and Mrs. Burrows, the pretty, an hour
or two; then to the Swan a while; and so home by water, and with
my wife by and by, by water as low as Greenwich for ayre only; and
so back again home to supper and to bed with great pleasure.
