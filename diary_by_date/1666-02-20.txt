Up, and to the office — where, among other businesses, Mr.
Evelyn’s proposition about public Infirmarys was read and agreed
on, he being there. And at noon I took him home to dinner, being
desirous of keeping my acquaintance with him; and a most
excellent-humourd man Istill find him, and mighty knowing.
After dinner I took him by coach to Whitehall, and there he and I
586
parted; and I to my Lord Sandwiches, where, coming and bolting
into the dining-room, Ithere found Capt. Ferrer going to christen a
child of his, born yesterday, and I came just pat to be a godfather,
along with my Lord Hinchingbrooke and Madam Pierce my
valentine — which for that reason I was pretty well contented with —
thougha little vexed to see myself so beset with people to spend my
money, as, she fora Valentine, and little Mrs. Tooker, who is come
to my house this day from Greenwich, and will cost me 20s., my
wife going out with her this afternoon, and now this Christening.
Well, by and by the child is brought, and christened Katharine. And
I this day on this occasion drank a glass of wine, which I have not
professedly done these two years I think — buta
little in the time of
the sickness. After that done, and gone and kissed the mother in bed
—Jaway to Westminster hall and there hear that Mrs. Lane is come
to town. SoI stayed loitering up and down, till anon she comes and
agreed to meet at Swayns; and there I went anon and she came, but
stayed but little, the place not being private. I have not seen her
since before the plague. So thence parted, and rencontrai a her last
logis, and in that place did hazer what I tena a mind para faire con
her. At last she desired to borrow money of me, 5/, and would
pawn gold with me for it; which I accepted, and promised in a day
or two to supply her. So away home to the office, and thence home.
So to bed — a little troubled that I have been at two houses this
afternoon with Mrs. Lane that were formerly shut up of the plague.
