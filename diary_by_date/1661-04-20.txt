Here comes my boy to tell me that the Duke of Yorke hath
sent for all the Principall officers &c to come to him today. So I
went by water to Mr. Coventrys and there stayed and talked a good
while with him till all the rest came. We went up and saw the Duke
dress himself, and in his night habitt he is a very plain man. Then he
sent us to his closet, where we saw, among other things, two very
fine chests covered with gold and Indian varnish, given him by the
East India Company of Holland. The Duke comes; and after he had
told us that the fleet was designed for Algier (which was kept from
us till now), we did advise about many things as to the fitting of the
fleet and so went away. And from thence to the Privy Seale, where
little to do. So to the Cockpitt; and there, by favour of one Mr.
Bowman, got in and saw The Humorsome Lieutenant acted before
the King, but not very well done. But my pleasure was great to see
the manner of it; and so many great beauties, but above all Mrs.
Palmer, with whom the King doth discover a great deal of
Familiarity.
