To Westminster hall, where it was full terme. Here all the
morning; and at noon to my Lord Crewes — where one Mr.
Templer (an ingenious [man] and a person of honour he seems to
be) dined; and discoursing of the nature of Serpents, he told us of
some that in the waste places of Lancashire do grow to a great
bigness, and that do feed upon larkes, which they take thus — they
observe when the lark is soared to the highest, and do crawle till
they come to be just underneath them, and there they place
themselfs with their mouths uppermost, and there (as is conceived)
they do eject poyson up to thebird; for the bird doth suddenly come
down again in its course ofa circle, and falls directly into the mouth
of the serpent — which is very strange. He is a great traveller; and
speaking of the Tarantula, he says that all the harvest long (about
which time they are most busy) there are fidlers go up and down in
the fields everywhere, [in] expectation of being hired by those that
are stung.
