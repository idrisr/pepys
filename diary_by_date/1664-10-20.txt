Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon my
uncle Tho. came; dined with me and received some money of me.
Then I to my office, where I took in with me Bagwells wife; and
there I caressed her, and-find her every day more and more coming,
with good words and promise of getting her husband aplace,
which I will do. So we parted, and I to my Lord Sandwich at his
lodgings; and after a little stay, away with Mr. Cholmely to Fleet
street, in the way he telling me that Tanger is like to be in a bad
condition with this Fitzgerald, he being a man of no honour nor
presence, nor little honesty, and endeavours to raise the Irish and
suppress the English interest there, and offends everybody — and
doth nothing that I hear of well — which I am sorry for.
