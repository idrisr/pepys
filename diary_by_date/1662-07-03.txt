Up by 4 a-clock and to my office till 8 o’clock, writing over
two Copys of our contract with Sir Wm. Rider &c. for 500 ton of
Hempe; which, because it is a secret, I have the trouble of writing
over, as well as drawing. Then home to dress myself and so to the
office — where another fray between Sir Rich: Ford and myself
about his yarne. At noon, we all by invitation dined at the Dolphin
with the Officers of the Ordinance; where Sir W. Compton and
Mr. Oneale and other great persons were, and a very great dinner.
But I drank, as I still do, but my allowance of wine. Then to my
office all the afternoon, as long as I could see — about setting many
businesses in order. In the evening came Mr. Lewes to me, and very
ingeniously did inquire whether I did ever look into the business of
the Chest at Chatham; and after my readiness to be informed did
appear to him, he did produce a paper wherein he stated the
government of the Chest to me; and upon the whole did tell me
how it hath ever been abused, and to this day is, and what a
meritorious act it would be to look after it; which I am resolved to
do, ifGod bless me—and do thank him very much for it. So home;
and after a turn or two upon the leads with my wife, who hath lately
had but little of my company since I begun to fallow my business,
but is contented therewith since she sees how Ispend my time. And
so to bed.
