To the office, where all the morning. And Ifind Mr. Coventry
is resolved to do much good and to inquire into all the miscarriages
of the office. At noon with him and Sir W. Batten to dinner at
Trinity house— where among others, Sir
J.Robinson, Lieutenant of
the Tower, was. My mind in great trouble whether I should go as I
entended to Hampton Court tomorrow or no. At last, resolved the
contrary because of the charge thereof and I am afeared now to
bring in any accounts for journys; and so will others I suppose be,
because of Mr. Coventry’s prying into them. Thence sent for to Sir
G. Carterets, and there talked with him a good while. I perceive, as
he told me, were it not that Mr. Coventry hath already feathered his
nest in selling of places, he doth like him very well and hopes great
good from him. But he complains so of lack of money, that my
heart is very sad, under the apprehension of the fall of the office.
g. earely up and at the office with Mr. Hater, making my
Alphabet of Contracts, upon the dispatch of which I am now very
intent, for that I am resolved much to inquire into the price of
commodities. Dined at home; and after dinner to my brother’s and
several other places; among the rest, to Gratorex’s and with him
and another stranger to the Taverne, but I drunk no wine. He
commended Bond, of our end of the towne, to teach me to measure
Timber — and some other things that I would learn in order to my
office. So home to supper and to bed.
