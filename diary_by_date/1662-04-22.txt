After taking leave of my wife, which we could hardly do
kindly, because of her mind to go along with me— Sir W. PennandI
took coach and so over the bridge to Lambeth - W. Bodham and
Tom Hewet going as clerks to Sir W. Penn, and my Will for me.
Here we got a dish of buttered eggs, and there stayed till Sir G.
Carteret came to us from Whitehall, who brought Dr. Clerke with
him, at which I was very glad. And so we set out. And I was very
much pleased with his company, and were very merry all the way.
