Up, and all day in some little grutchings of pain, as I use to
have — from Winde — arising, | think, from my fasting so long and
want of exercise — and I think, going so hot in clothes, the weather
being hot and Iin the same clothes I wore all winter. To the Change
after office, and received my Wach from the watchmaker; and a
very fine [one] it is— given me by Briggs the Scrivener. But Lord, to
see how much of my old folly and childishnesse hangs upon me
still, that I cannot forbear carrying my watch in my hand in the
coach all this afternoon, and seeing what a-clock it is 100 times. And
am apt to think with myself: how could I be so long without one —
though I remember since, I had one and found it a trouble, and
resolved to carry one no more about me whileI lived.
