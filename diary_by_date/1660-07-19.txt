I did lie late a-bed. I and my wife by water. Landed her at
Whitefriars with her boy, with an Iron of our new range which is
1. Will Hewer, Pepys’s new clerk.
64
already broke and my wife will have changed, and many other
things she hath to buy with the help of my father today. I to my
Lord and find him in bed. After talk with my Lord I went to
Westminster hall, where I took Mr. Michell and his wife (and Mrs.
Murford we sent for afterward) to the Dogg tavern, where I did
give thema dish of anchoves and olives and paid for all. And did
talk of our old discourse when we did use to talk of the King, in the
time of the Rump, privately. After that to the Admiralty Office in
Whitehall, where I stayed and writ my last observations for these
four days last past. Great talk of the difference between the
Episcopall and Presbyterian clergy, but I believe it will come to
nothing. So home and to bed.
