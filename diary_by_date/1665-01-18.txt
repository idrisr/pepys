Up, and by and by to my bookseller’s and there did give
thorough direction for the new binding of a great many of my old
books, to make my whole study of the same binding, within very
few. Thence to my Lady Sandwiches, who sent for me this
morning. Dined with her — and it was to get a letter of hers
conveyed by a safe hand to my Lord’s own hand at Portsmouth;
which I did undertake. Here my Lady did begin to talk of what she
hath heard concerning Creed; of his being suspected to be a fanatic
anda false fellow. Itold her Ithought he was as shrewd and cunning
a man as any in England, and one that I would fear first should
outwit me in everything — to which she readily concurred. Thence
to Mr. Povy’s by agreement; and there, with Mr. Sherwin, Auditor
Beale, and Creede and I, hard at it very late about Mr. Povys
- accounts; but such accounts I never did see, or hope again to see in
my days. At night late, they gone, I did get him to put out of this
account our sums that are in posse only yet — which he approved of
when told, but would never have stayed it if I had been gone.
Thence at 9 at night home; and so to supper, vexed and head akeing,
and to bed.
