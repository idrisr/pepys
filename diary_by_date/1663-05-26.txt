Lay long in bed, talking and pleasing myself with my wife. So
up and to my office a while and then home, where Ifind Pembleton;
and Iam led to conclude that there is something more then ordinary
between my wife and him. There dined with me Mr. Creed and
Capt. Grove; but nothing could get the business out of my head, I
fearing that this afternoon, by my wife’s sending every[one] abroad
and knowing that I must be at the office, she hath appointed him to
come. This is my devilish jealousy; which I pray God may be false,
but it makes a very hell in my mind; which the God of heaven
remove, or I shall be very unhappy. So to the office, where we sat a
while. By and by, my mind being in great trouble, I went home to
see how things were; and there I find as I doubted, Mr. Pembleton
with my wife and nobody else in the house, which made me almost
mad; and going up to my chamber, after a turn or two I went out
again and to the office; and Mr. Coventry nor Sir G. Carteret being
there, I made a quick end of our business and desired leave to be
gone, pretending to go to the Temple, but it was home; and so up to
my chamber and, as I think, ifthey had any intentions of hurt, I did
prevent doing anything at that time; but I continued in my chamber
vexed and angry till he went away, pretending aloud, that I might
hear, that he could not stay, and Mrs. Ashwell not being within
they would not dance. And Lord, to see how my jealousy wrought
so far, that I went saftly up to see whether any of the beds were out
of order or no, which I found not; but that did not content me, but I
stayed all the evening walking, and though anon my wife came up
to me and would have spokeof business to me, yet I construed it to
be but impudence; and though my heart was full, yet I did say
nothing, being in a great doubt what to do. So at night suffered
them to go all to bed, and late put myself to bed in great discontent,
and so to sleep.
