Lords day. Up; and all the morning in my chamber setting
some of my private papers in order — for I perceive that now public
business takes up so much of my time that I must get time a-
Sundays or a-nights to look after my own matters. Dined and spent
all the afternoon talking with my wife. At night,a
little to the office
and so home to supper and to bed.
