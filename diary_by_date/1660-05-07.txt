This morning Capt. Cuttance sent me a dozen of bottles of
Margett ale — three of which I drank presently with some friends in
the Coach: my Lord went this morning about the flag-ships in a
boat, to see what alterations there must be as to the armes and flags.
He did give me order also to write for silk flags and Scarlett
wastecloaths. Fora rich barge. Fora noise of Trumpetts; anda set of
Fidlers. In the afternoon I lost ss. at ninepins. After supper,
Musique and to bed — having also among us at the coach-table
wrote a letter to the French Embassador in French — about the
release of a ship that we have taken. After I was in bed, Mr. Sheply
and W. Howe came and sat in my cabin, where I gave them three
bottles of Marget ale, and sat laughing and very merry till almost
one a-clock in the morning; and so good-night.
