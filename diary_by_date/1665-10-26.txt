Up, and to the office; and thither comes SirJer. Smith and Sir
Chr. Mings to see me, being just come from Portsmouth and going
down to the fleet. Here Isat and talked with them a good while, and
then parted, only Sir Chr. Mings and I together by water to the
Tower. And I find him a very witty well-spoken fellow, and
$45
mighty free to tell his parentage, being a shoemaker’s son, to whom
he is now going. AndI to the Change— where Ihear how the French
have taken two and sunk one of our Merchantmen in the Streights
and carried the ships to Toulon — so that there is no expectation but
we must fall out with them. The Change pretty full, and the town
begins to be lively again — though the streets very empty and most
shops shut. So back again I, and took boat and called for Sir Chr.
Mings at St. Katharines, who was fallowed with some ordinary
friends, of which he says he is proud; and so down to Greenwich,
the wind furious high, and we with our sail up till I made it be taken
down. I took him, it being 3 a-clock, to my lodgings, and did give
him a good dinner and so parted, he being pretty close to me as to
any business of the fleet, knowing me to be a servant of my Lord
Sandwiches. He gone, I to the office till night; and then they come
and tell me my wife is come to town, so I to her, vexed at her
coming; but it was upon innocent business, and so Iwas pleased and
made her stay, Capt. Ferrers and his lady being yet there. And so I
left them to dance, and I to the office till past 9 at night; and so to
them and there saw them dance very prettily, the Captain and his
wife, my wife, and Mrs. Barbary and Mercer, and my landlady’s
daughter; and then little Mrs. Fr. Tooker and her mother, a pretty
woman, come to see my wife. Anon to supper, and then to dance
again (Golding being our fidler, who plays very well and all tunes)
till past 12 at night, and then we broke up and everyone to bed.
