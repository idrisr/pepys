Upand to my office, showing myself to Sir W. Batten and Sir
J. Mennes, and no great matter made of my periwig, as I was
afeared there would. Among other things, there came to me this
morning Shales of Portsmouth by my order, and I begun to
discourse with him about the arreares of stores belonging to the
Victualling Office there; and by his discourse, I am in some hopes
that if] can get a grant from the Kingofsuch a part of
all Idiscover, I
may chance to find a way to get something by the by, which doth
greatly please me the very thoughts of. Home to dinner and very
pleasant with my wife, who is this day also herself making of
Marmalett of Quince, which she now doth very well herself. I left
her at it, and by coach I to the New Exchange and several places to
buy and bring home things; among others, a case I bought of the
Trunke-makers for my periwigg; and so home and to my office
late.
