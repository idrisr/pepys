Up betimes, and by coach towards Whitehall; and took
Aldgate street in my way and there called upon one Hayward that
makes virginalls, and did there like ofa little Espinettes and will
have him finish them for me; for I had a mind to a small Harpsicon,
but this takes up less room and will do my business as to finding out
of Chords — and I am very well pleased that I have found it. Thence
to Whitehall; and after long waiting did get a small running
Committee of Tanger, where I stayed but little; and little done but
900
the correcting two or three egregious faults in the Charter for
Tanger, after it had so long lain before the Council and been passed
there and drawn up by the Atturny general, so slightly are all things
in this age done.
