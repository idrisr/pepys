To Whitehall, and there all the morning, and thence home;
and giving order for some business, and setting my brother to
making a catalogue of my books, I back again to W. Hewer to
Whitehall, where I attended the Duke of York and was by him led
to the King, who expressed great sense of my misfortune in my
eyes, and concernment for their recovery; and accordingly signified
not only his assent to my desire therein, but commanded me to give
them rest this summer, according to my late petition to the Duke of
York. W. Hewer andI dined alone at the Swan, and thence, having
thus waited on the King, spent till 4 a-clock in St. James’s park,
when I met my wife at Unthankes and so home.
