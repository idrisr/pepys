Up, and with Sir W. Batten to Whitehall, where we attended as
usual the Duke of York; and there was, by the folly of Sir W.
688
Batten, prevented in obtaining a bargain for Capt. Cocke which
would, I think, have [been] at this time (during our great want of
hemp) both profitable to the King and of good convenience to me.
But I matter it not —it being done only by the folly, not any design,
of Sir W. Batten. Thence to Westminster hall; and it being fast-
day,’ there was no shops open; but meeting with Doll Lane, did go
with her to the Rose tavern and there drank and played with her a
good while. She went away, and I stayed a good while after, and
was seen going out by one of our neighbours near the office and two
of the Hall people that Ihad no mind to have been seen by; but there
was no hurt in it, nor can be alleged from it — therefore I am not
solicitous in it; but took coach and called at Faythornes to buy some
prints for my wife to draw by this winter; and here did see my Lady
Castlemaynes picture, done by him from Lillys, in red chalke and
other colours, by which he hath cut it in copper to be printed. The
picture in chalke is the finest thing I ever saw in my life I think, and
did desire to buy it; but he says he must keep it awhile to correct his
Copper plate by, and when that is done, he will sell it me.
By the Duke of York his discourse today in his chamber, they
have it at Court, as well as we here, that a fatal day is to be expected
shortly, of some great mischiefe in the remainder of this week;
whether by the papists, or what, they are not certain. But the day is
disputed; some say next Friday, others a day sooner, others later;
and I hope all will prove a foolery. But it is observable how
everybody’s fears are busy at this time.
