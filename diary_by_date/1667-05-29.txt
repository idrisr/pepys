Up and by coach to St. James’s, where by and by up to the
Duke of York; where among other things, our Parson Mills having
the offer of another benefice by Sir Rob. Brookes, who was his
pupil, he by my Lord Barkely’s [desire] —is made one of the Duke’s
chaplains; which qualifies him for two livings. But to see how
slightly such things are done; the Duke of York only taking my
Lord Barkely’s word upon saying that we, the Officers of the
Navy, do say he is a good man and minister of our parish; and the
Duke of York admits him to kiss his hand but speaks not one word
779
to him, but so a warrant will be drawn from the Duke of York to
qualify him, and there’s an end of it. Thence home, and there settle
to some accounts of mine in my chamber, all the morning till
dinner. My wife comes home from Woolwich but did not dine with
me, going to dress herself against night to go to Mrs. Pierces to be
merry, where we are to have Knipp and Harris and other good
people. I at my accounts all the afternoon, beinga
little lost in them
as to reckonings of interest. Anon comes down my wife, dress[ed]
in her second mourning, with her black moyre waistcoat and short
petticoat, laced with silver lace so basely that I could not endure to
see her, and with laced lining, which is too soon; so that I was horrid
angry and went out of doors to the office, and there stayed and
would not, go to our intended meeting, which vexed me to the
blood; and my wife sent twice or thrice to me to direct her any way
to dress her but to put on her cloth gown, which she would not
venture, which made me mad; and so in the evening to my
chamber, vexed, and to my accounts, which I ended to my great
content, and did make amends for the loss of our mirth this night by
getting this done, which otherwise I fear I should not have done a
good while else. So to bed.
