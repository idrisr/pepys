Lords day. Up and ready, and all the morning in my chamber
looking over and settling some Brampton businesses. At noon to
dinner, where the remains of yesterday’s venison and a couple of
brave green geese; which we are fain to eat alone, because they will
not keep — which troubled us. After dinner, I close to my business;
and before the evening, did end it with great content and my mind
eased by it. Then up and spent the evening walking with my wife,
talking; and it thundering and lightening mightily all the evening —
and this year have had the most thunder and lightening, they say, of
any in man’s memory; and so it is it seems in France and everywhere
else. So to prayers and to bed.
