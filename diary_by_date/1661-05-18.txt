Toward Westminster from the towre by water; and was fain
to stand upon one of the peeres about the bridge before the men
could drag their boat through the lock, and which they could not do
till another was called to help them. Being through bridge, I find
the Thames full of boats and gallys; and upon enquiry find that
there was a wager to be run this morning. So spying of Payne in a
galley, I went into him and there stayed, thinking to have gone to
Chelsy with them; but upon the start, the wager-boats fell foul one
of ancther, till at last one of them goes over, pretending foule play;
and so the other rew away alone — and all our sport lost. So I went
ashore at Westminster; and to the hall I went, where it was very
pleasant to see the hall in the condition it is now, with the judges in
the benches at the further end of it — which I had not seen all this
tearme till now. Thence with Mr. Spicer, Creed and some others to
drink; and so away homewards by water with Mr. Creed, whom I
left in London going about business; and Ihome- whereI stayed all
the afternoon. And in the garden reading Faber fortunae with great
pleasure. So home to bed.
