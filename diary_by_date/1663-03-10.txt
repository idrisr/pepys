Dined upon a poor Lenten dinner at home, my wife being
vexed at a fray this morning with my Lady Batten about my boy’s
going thither to turn the water-cock, with their maids leave, but
my Lady was mighty high upon it, and she would teach his mistress
better manners; which my wife answered aloud, that she might
hear, that she could learn little manners of her. After dinner to my
office, and then we sat all the afternoon till 8 at night; and so wrote
my letters by the post, and so before 9 home, which is rare with me
of late, I staying longer; but with multitude of business, my head
akes and so I can stay no longer, but home to supper and to bed.
