Up betimes; and by water to Whitehall and thence to Sir Ph.
Warwickes; and there had half an hour’s private discourse with him
and did give him some good satisfaccion in our Navy matters, and
he also me, as to the money paid and due to the Navy — so as he
makes me assured, by perticulars, that Sir G. Carteret is paid within
8000ol, every farthing, that we to this day, nay to Michaelmas day
next, have demanded; and that I am sure is above 50000! more then
truly our expense hath been — whatever is become of the money.
Home, with great content that I have thus begun an acquaintance
with him, who is a great man and a man of as much business as any
man in England — which I will endeavour to deserve and keep.
Pepys is now at Brampton, having ridden there with his wife on the 14th—-
15th to attend the manorial court in connection with the dispute with his
uncle Thomas Pepys about Robert Pepys’s estate (see above, pp. 144-5).
He now rides to Wisbech to investigate the chances ofgaining something
from the estate of another relative, John Day, who had died in 1649.
