Up, and to the Duke of Albemarles, where he showed me Mr.
Coventry’s letters; how three Dutch privateers are taken, in one
whereof Everson’s son is Captaine. But they have killed poor Capt.
Golding in the Diamond. Two of them, one of 32 and the other of 20
odd guns, did stand stoutly up against her, which hath 46, and the
Yarmouth, that hath 52 guns, and as many more men as they — so
that they did more then we could expect, not yielding till many of
their men were killed. And Everson, when he was brought before
the Duke of Yorke and was observed to be shot through the hat,
answered that he wished it had gone through his head, rather then
been taken. One thing more is written: that two of our ships the
other day appearing upon the coast of Holland, they presently fired
their Beacons round the country, to give notice. And news is
brought the King that the Dutch Smirna fleet is seen upon the back
of Scottland; and thereupon, the King hath wrote to the Duke that
he doth appoint a fleet to go to the Northward to try to meet them
coming home round - which God send. Thence to Whitehall;
where the King seeing me, did come to me, and calling me by
name, did discourse with me about the ships in the River; and this is
the first time that ever I knew the King did know me personally, so
that hereafter I must not go thither but with expectation to be
Questioned, and to be ready to give good answers. This day was
left at my house a very neat Silver watch, by one Briggs, a Scrivener
and Sollicitor; at which I was angry with my wife for receiving, or
at least opening the box wherein it was, and so far witnessing our
receipt of it as to give the messenger $s. for bringing it. But it can’t
be helped, and I will endeavour to do the man a kindness — he being
a friend of my uncle Wights.
