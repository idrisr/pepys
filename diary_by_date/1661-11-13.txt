By appointment, we all went this morning to wait upon the
Duke of Yorke, which we did in his chamber as he was dressing
himself in his riding-suit to go this day by sea to the Downes. After
we had given him our letter relating the bad condition of the Navy
for want of mony, he referred it to his coming back and so parted.
And I to Westminster hall and to see La belle Pearce; and so on foot
to my Lord Crews, where I find him come to his new house, which
is next to that he lived in last. Here I was well received by my Lord
and Sir Thomas — with whom I had great talk; and he tells me in
good earnest that he doth believe the parliament (which comes to sit
again the next week) will be troublesome to the Court and Clergy,
which God forbid. But they see things carried so by my Lord
Chancellor and some others, that get money themselfs, that they
will not endure it. From thence to the Theatre and there saw Father’s
owne Sonn again. And so it raining very hard, I went home by
Coach, with my mind very heavy for this my expenseful life; which
will undo me] fear, after all my hopes, if1 do not take up — for now I
am coming to lay out a great deal of money in clothes upon my
wife, I must forbear other expenses.
