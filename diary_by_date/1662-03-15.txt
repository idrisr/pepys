With Sir G. Carteret and both the Sir Wms at Whitehall to
wait on the Duke in his chamber, which we did, about getting
money for the navy — and other things. So back again to the office
all the morning. Then to the Exchange to hire a ship for the
Maderas, but could get none. Then home to dinner, and Sir G.
Carteret and I all the afternoon by ourselfs upon business in the
office, till late at night: so to write letters and home to bed.
