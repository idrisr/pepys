Up betimes to set my victualling papers in order against Sir W.
Coventry comes — which endeed makes me very melancholy, being
conscious that I am much to seek in giving good answer to his
queries about the victualling businesses. At the office mighty busy,
and brought myself into a pretty plausible condition before Sir W.
Coventry came, and did give him a pretty tolerable account of
everything; and went with him unto the Victualling Office, where
we sat and examined his businesses and state of the victualling of the
fleet; which made me in my heart blush that Icould say no more to it
then I did or could — but I trust in God I shall never be in that
condition again. We parted, and I with pretty good grace; and so
home to dinner, where my wife troubled more and more with her
swollen cheek. So to dinner, my sister-in-law with us, who I find
more and more a witty woman. And then! to my Lord Treasurer’s
and the Exchequer about my Tanger businesses. And with mighty
content passed by all things and persons, without so much as
desiring any stay or loss of time with them, being by strong vow
obliged on no occasion to stay abroad but my public offices. So
home again, where I find Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Ferrers come to see
my wife. I stayeda little with them, being full of business; and so to
the office, where busy till late at night; and so, weary — andalittle
conscious of my failures today, yet proud that the day is over
without more observation on Sir W. Coventry’s part; and so to bed
and to sleep soundly.
