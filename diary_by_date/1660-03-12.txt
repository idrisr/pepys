This day the wench ris at 2 in the morning to wash, and my
wife andI lay talking a great while; I, by reason of my cold, could
not tell how to sleep. My wife and I to the Exchange,’ where we
bought a great many things, where I left her and went into London
to do a great many things, in order to my going. So came back and
at Wilkinson’s found Mr. Sheply and some sea people, as the cook
of the Nazeby and others, at dinner. Then to the White horse in
Kings street, where Igot Mr. Biddles horse to ride to Huntsmore to
Mr. Bowyers; where I found him and all well and willing to have
my wife come and board with them while I was at sea, which was
the business Iwent about. Here Ilay and took a thing for my cold by
Mrs. Bowyers direction, viz. a spoonful of honey and a nutmeg
scraped into it and so take it into the mouth, which I found did do
me much good.
