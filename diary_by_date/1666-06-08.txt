To the Exchequer about some Tanger businesses; and then
home, where to my very great joy I find Balty come home without
any hurt, after the utmost imaginable danger he hath gone through
in the Henery, being upon the Quarter-deck with Harman all the
time; and for which service Harman, I heard this day, commended
most seriously, and most eminently by the Duke of Yorke.
