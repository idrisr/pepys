At noon home and there find Mr. Goodgroome, whose
teaching of my wife, only by singing over and over again to her and
letting her sing with him, not by herself, to correct her faults, I do
not like at all but was angry at it; but have this content, that I do
think she will come to sing pretty well and to trill in time, which
pleases me well. He dined with us; and then to the office, where we
hada silly meeting to little purpose and then broke up; and I to my
738
office and busy late to good purpose; and so home to supper and to
bed. This day a poor seaman, almost starved for want offood, lay in
our yard a-dying; I sent him half-a-crown — and we ordered his
ticket to be paid.
