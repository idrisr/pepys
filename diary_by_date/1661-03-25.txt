Lady-day. This morning came workmen to begin the making
of me a new pair of stairs up out of my parlour, which, with other
work that I have to do, I doubt will keep me this two months; and
so long I shall be all in dirt — but the work doth please me very well.

To the office then. And there all the morning. [At night] to my
father’s and there stayed talking with my mother and him late about
my dinner tomorrow. So homewards and took upa boy that had a
lanthorn, that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me
home. And had great discourse with him how he could get
sometimes three or four bushels of rags in a day, and gat 3d. a bushel
for them. And many other discourses, what and how many ways
there are for poor children to get their livings honestly. So home to
bed — at 12 a-clock at night, being pleased well with the work that
my workmen have begun today.
