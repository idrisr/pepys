Lay long with my wife, contenting her about the business of
Gosnells going, and I perceive she will be contented as well as
myself. After dinner stayed within all the afternoon, being vexed in
240
my mind about the going away of Sarah this afternoon, who cried
mightily, and so was Iready to do, and Jane did also. And then anon
went Gosnell away, which did trouble me too, though upon many
considerations it is better that I am rid of that charge. Altogether
makes my house appear to me very lonely, which troubles me
much.
