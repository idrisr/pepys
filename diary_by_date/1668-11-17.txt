Up, and to the office all the morning, where the new
Treasurers came their second time; and before they sat down, did
discourse with the Board, and perticularly my Lord Brouncker,
about their place which they challenge, as hav[ing] been heretofore
due and given to their predecessor; which at last my Lord did own it
hath been given him only out of courtesy to his quality, and that he
did not take it as of right at the Board; so they for the present sat
down and did give him the place, but I think with an intent to have
the Duke of York’s directions about it. My wife and maids busy
now to make clean the house above stairs, the Upholsters having
done there in her closet and the blue room; and are mighty pretty.
At my office all the afternoon and at night, busy; and so home to my
wife, and pretty pleasant and at mighty ease in my mind, being in
hopes to find Deb, and without trouble or the knowledge of my
wife. So to supper at night, and to bed.
