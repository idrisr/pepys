Up, and at the office all the morning; and so at noon to dinner.
And after dinner, my wife and Ito the Duke’s playhouse, where we
saw the new play acted yesterday. The Feign Innocence or Sir Martin
Marr-all, a play made by my Lord Duke of Newcastle, but as
everybody says corrected by Dryden. It is the most entire piece of
Mirth, a complete Farce from one end to the other, that certainly
was ever writ. I never laughed so in all my life; I laughed till my
head [ached] all the evening and night with my laughing, and at
very good wit therein, not fooling. The house full, and in all things
of mighty content to me. Thence to the New Exchange with my
wife, where at my bookseller’s Isaw the History ofthe Royall Society,
which I believe is a fine book and I have bespoke one in quires. So
home, andIto the office a little; and so to my chamber and read the
history of 88 in Speede, in order to my seeing the play thereof acted
tomorrow at the King’s House. So to supper, in some pain by the
sudden change of the weather cold and my drinking of cold drink;
which Imust I fear begin to leave off, thoughI shall try it as long as I
can without much pain. But] find myself to be full of wind, and my
anus to be knit together, as it is always with cold. Everybody
wonders that we have no news from Bredah of the ratification of
the peace, and do suspect that there is some stop in it. So to bed.
