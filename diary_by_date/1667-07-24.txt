Ito my office, and there hard at work all the morning, to my
great content, abstracting the contract Booke in into my abstract
book; which I have by reason of the war omitted for above two
years, but now am endeavouring to have all my books ready and
perfect against the Parliament comes, that upon examination I may
be in condition to value myself upon my perfect doing of my own
duty. Atnoon home to dinner, where my wife mighty musty, but I
took no notice of it; but after dinner to the office, and there with
Mr. Harper did another good piece of work about my late
collection of the accounts of the Navy presented to the Parliament
at their last session, which was left unfinished and now I have done
it, which sets my mind at my ease. And so having tired myself, I
took a pair of oares about § a-clock, which I made a gally at Red-
riffe; and so with very much pleasure down to Gravesend, all the
way with extraordinary content reading of Boyl’s Hydrostatickes;
which the more I read and understand, the more I admire as a most
excellent piece of philosophy.
