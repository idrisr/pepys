Twelfth day. Up and to my office, where very busy all the
morning; being endeed over-loaded with it through my own desire
of doing all I can. At noon to the Change but did little, and so home
to dinner with my poor wife; and after dinner read a lecture to her in
Geography, which she takes very prettily, and with great pleasure
to her and me to teach her. And so to the office again, where as busy
as ever in my life, one thing after another and answering people’s
business. Perticularly, drawing up things about Mr. Woods masts,
which I expect to have a quarrel about with Sir W. Batten before it
be ended — but I care not. At night home to my wife to supper,
discourse, prayers, and to bed. This morning I begun a
practice
whichI find, by the ease I do it with, that I shall continue, it saving
me money and time —that is, to Trimme myself with a Razer —
which pleases me mightily. :
