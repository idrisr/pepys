At the office in the morning and did business. By and by we
are called to Sir W. Battens to see the strange creature that Capt.
Holmes hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboone,
but so much like a man in most things, that (though they say there is
a Species of them) yet I cannot believe but that it is a monster got of
a man and she-baboone. I do believe it already understands much
english; and I am of the mind it might be tought to speak or make
149
signs. To the Opera and there saw Hamlet Prince ofDenmarke, done
with Scenes very well. But above all, Batterton did the Prince’s part
beyond imagination.
