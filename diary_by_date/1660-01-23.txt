To my office and there did nothing but make up my balance.
Came home and found my wife dressing of the girl’s head, by
which she was made to look very pretty. I went out and paid
Wilkinson what I did owe him, and brought a piece of beef home
for dinner. Thence I went out and paid Waters the Vintner, and
went to see Mrs. Jem, where I found my Lady Wright; but Scott
was so drunk that he would not be seen. Here Istayed and made up
Mrs. Anns bills and played a game or two at cards; and thence to
Westminster hall, it being very dark. I pay Mrs. Michell my
bookseller, and back to Whitehall, and in the garden, going
through to the Stone Gallery, I fell in a ditch, it being very dark. At
the Clerks’ chamber I met with Simons and Luellin and went with
them to Mr. Mounts chamber at the Cockpit, where we had some
rare pot venison and Ale to abundance till almost 12 at night; and
after a song round, we went home.
