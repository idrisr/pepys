I went inthe morning to Mr. Messum’s, where! met with W.
Thurburne and sat with him in his pew. A very eloquent sermon
about the duty of all to give good example in our lives and
conversation, whichI fear he himself was most guilty of not doing.
After sermon, at the door by appointment my wife met me; and so
to my father’s to dinner, where we have not been, to my shame, ina
fortnight before. After dinner my father showed me aletter from
1. To Hinchingbrooke.
2. East, a servant of Mountagu’s.
8
Mr. Widdrington of Christ’s College in Cambrige, wherein he
doth express very great kindness for my brother, and my father
entends that my brother shall go to him. This day I began to put on
buckles to my shoes, which Ihad bought yesterday of Mr. Wotton.
