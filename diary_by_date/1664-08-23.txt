Lay long, talking with my wife and angry a while about her
desiring to have a French maid all of a sudden; which I took to arise
from yesterday’s being with her mother. But that went over, and
friends again; and so she be well qualitied, I care not much whether
she be French or no, so a protestant. Thence to the office; and at
noon to the Change, where very busy getting ships for Guiny and
for Tanger. So home to dinner; and then abroad all the afternoon,
doing several errands to comply with my oath of ending many
businesses before Bartholomew day, which is two days hence.
Among others, I went into New Bridewell in my way to Mr. Cole,
and is very handsome, several at work. And among others, one
pretty whore brought in last night, which works very lazily. I did
give them 6d. to drink, and so away — to Grayes Inn, but missed Mr.
Cole and so homeward; called at Harman’s and there bespoke some
chairs for a room. And so home and busy late; and then to supper
and to bed. The Dutch East India fleet are now come home safe,
417
which we are sorry for. Our fleets on both sides are hastening out to
Guinny.
