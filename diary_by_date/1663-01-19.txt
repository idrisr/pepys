By coach to Mr. Povys, being invited thither by a messenger
this morning from him — where really, he made a most excellent
and large dinner, even to admiration; he bidding us in a frolique to
call for what we had a mind and he would undertake to give it us —
and we did, for prawns — Swan — venison after I had thought the
dinner was quite done, and he did immediately produce it, which I
thought great plenty. And he seems to set off his rest in this plenty
and the neatness of his house; which he after dinner showed me
from room to room, so beset with delicate pictures, and aboveall, a
piece of per[s]pective in his closet in the low parler. His stable,
where was some most delicate horses, and the very racks painted,
and mangers, witha neat leaden painted cistern and the walls done
with Dutch tiles like my chimnies. But still, above all things, he bid
me go down into his wine-cellar, where upon several shelves there
stood bottles of all sorts of wine, new and old, with labells pasted
upon each bottle, and in that order and plenty as I never saw books
in a bookseller’s shop. And herein, I observe, he puts his highest
content and will accordingly commend all that he hath, but still
they deserve to be so.
