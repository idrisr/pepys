Up earely — to see my workmen at work. My brother Tom
comes to me, and among other things, Ilooked over my old clothes
and did give him a suit of black stuff clothes and a hat and some
shooes. At the office all the morning — where Sir G. Carteret comes.
At noon I find my stairs quite broke down, that I could not get up
but by a lather. And my wife not being well, she kept her chamber
all this day. Then to the Dolphin to a dinner of Mr. Harris’s, where
Sir Wms both and my Lady Batten and her two daughters and other
company — where a great deal of mirth. And there stayed till 11 a-
clock at night. And in our mirth, I sang and sometimes fiddled
(there being a noise of fiddlers there) and at last we fell to dancing —
the first time that ever I did in my life — which I did wonder to see
myself to do. At last we made Mingo, Sir W. Battens black, and
Jack, Sir W. Pens, dance; and it was strange how the first did dance
with a great deal of seeming skill. Home, where I find my wife all
day in her chamber, and so to bed.
