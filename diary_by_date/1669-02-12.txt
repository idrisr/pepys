Up and my wife with me to Whitehall, and Tom, and there
she sets us down; and there to wait on the Duke of York, with the
rest of us, at the Robes; where the Duke of York did tell us that the
King would have us prepare a draft of the present Administracion
of the Navy, and what it was in the late times — in order to his being
able to distinguish between the good and the bad; whichIshall do,
but to do it well will give me a great deal of trouble. Here we
showed him Sir J. Mennes’s propositions about balancing store-
keepers accounts; and Idid show him Hosiers, which did please him
mightily, and he will have it showed the Council and King anon, to
be put in practice.
