Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, and in the afternoon shut myself in my chamber, and
there till 12 at night finishing my great letter to the Duke of York;
which doth lay the ill condition of the Navy so open to him, that it is
impossible, ifthe King and he minds anything of their business, but
it will operate upon them to set all matters right, and get money to
carry on the war before it be too late, or else lay out for a peace upon
any Tearmes. It was a great convenience tonight, that what I had
writ fowle in shorthand, Icould read to W. Hewer and he take it fair
in shorthand so as I can read it tomorrow to Sir W. Coventry, and
then come heme and he read to me, while I take it in longhand to
present — which saves me much time. So to bed.
