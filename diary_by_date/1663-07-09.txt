Up; making water this morning (which I do every morning as
soon as Iam awake) with greater plenty and freedom thenI used to
do, which I think I may impute to last night drinking of Elder
spiritts. Sir W. Batten and I sot a little this afternoon at theoffice;
and then I by water to Deptford and there mustered the yard,
purposely (God forgive me) to find out Bagwell, a carpenter whose
wife is a pretty woman, that I might have some occasion of
knowing him and forcing her to come to the office again — which I
did so luckily, that going thence, he and his wife did of themselfs
meet me in the way, to thank me for my old kindness; but I spoke
little to her, but shall give occasion for her coming to me.
