early to Whitehall to the Chappell; where by Mr. Blagrave’s
means, I got into his pew and heard Dr. Creeton, the great
Scochman, preach — before the King and Duke and Duchesse —
upon the words of Michah: “‘Roule yourselves in dust.”” He made a
most learned sermon upon the words; but in his applicacion, the
most Comical] man that ever I heard in my life —just such a man as
Hugh peters. Saying that it had been better for the poor Cavalier
never to have come in with the King into England again; for he that
hath the impudence to deny obedience to the lawful magistrate and
to swear to the oath of allegeance &c, were better treated nowadays
in newgate then a poor Royalist that hath suffered all his life for the
King is at Whitehall among his friends. He discoursed much against
a man’s lying with his wife in Lent, saying that he might be as
incontinent during that time with his own wife as at another time in
another man’s bed.
