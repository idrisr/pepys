Tomy office, and there all the morning; and so home to dinner
— where I found Pall (my sister) was come; but I do not let her sit
down at table with me; which I do at first, that she may not expect it
hereafter from me. After dinner I to Westminster by water — and
there found my Brother Spicer at the Legg with all the rest of the
Exchequer men (most of whom I now do not know) at dinner. I
took a turne in the hall, and bought the King and Chancellors
speeches at the dissolving the parliament last Saturday. This day I
lent Sir W. Batten and Capt. Rider my chine of beef for to serve at
dinner tomorrow at Trinity house, the Duke of Albemarle being to
be there and all the rest of the Bretheren, it being a great day for the
reading over of their new Charter which the King hath newly given
them.
