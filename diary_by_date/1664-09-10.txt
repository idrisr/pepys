Up and to my office, where we sat all the morning. And |
much troubled to think what the end of our great sluggishness will
be, for we do nothing in this office like people able to carry on a
warr. We must be put out, or other people put in. Dined at home.
And then my wife and I and Mercer to the Dukes house and there
saw The Rivalls, which is no excellent play, but good action in it —
especially, Gosnell comes and sings and dances finely; but for all
that, fell out of the Key, so that the Musique could not play to her
afterward; and so did Harris also, go out of the tune to agree with
her. Thence home, and late writing letters; and this night I received
by Will 105/— the first fruits of my endeavours in the late Contract
for victualling of Tanger — for which God be praised. For I can with
a safe conscience say that I have therein saved the King s000l per
annum, and yet got myself a hope of 300/ per annum without the
least wrong to the King. So to supper and to bed.
