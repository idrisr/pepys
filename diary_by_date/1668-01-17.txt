Up, and by coach to Whitehall to attend the Council there;
and here I met, first by Mr. Castle the shipwright whom I met
there, and then from the whole House, all the discourse of the Duell
yesterday between the Duke of Buckingham, Holmes, and one
Jenkins on one side, and my Lord of Shrewsbury, Sir Jo. Talbot,
and one Bernard Howard, on the other side; and all about my Lady
Shrewsbury, who is a whore and is at this time, and hath for a great
while been, a whore to the Duke of Buckingham; and so her
husband challenged him, and they met yesterday in a close near
Barne Elmes and there fought; and my Lord Shrewsbury is run
through the body from the right breast through the shoulder, and
SirJ. Talbot all along up one of his arms, and Jenkins killed upon the
place, and the rest all in a little measure wounded. This will make
the world think that the King hath good councillors about him,
when the Duke of Buckingham, the greatest man about him, is a
fellow of no more sobriety then to fight about a whore.
