Up; and it snowing this morning a little, which from the
mildness of the winter and the weather beginning to be hot and the
summer to come on apace is a little strange to us — I did not go
abroad, because of my tumour, for fear it shall rise again; but stayed
within and by and by my father came, poor man, to me, and my
brother John; after much talk and taking them up to my chamber, I
did there after some discourse bring in my business of anger with
John and did before my father read all his roguish letters; which
troubled my father mightily, especially to hear me say what I did,
against my allowing anything for the time to come to him out of
my own purse, and other words very severe — while he, like a
simple rogue, made very silly and churlish answers to me, not like a
man of any goodness or wit — at which I was as much disturbed as
the other. This day the House of Parliament met and the King met
them, with the Queene with him — and he made a speech to them;
among other things, discoursing largely of the plots abroad against
him and the peace of the kingdom. And among other things, that
the dissatisfied party had great hopes upon the effect of the act for a
Trienniall parliament granted by his father — which he desired them
to peruse, and I think repeal. So the House did retire to their own
House and did order that act to be read tomorrow before them. And
I suppose will be repealed, though I believe much against the will of
a good many that sit there.
