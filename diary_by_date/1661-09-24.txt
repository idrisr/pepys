We rose and set forth; but find a most sad alteration in the
roade by reason of last night’s rains, they being now all dirty and
washy, though not deep. So we rode easily through and only
drinking at Halloway at the sign of a woman with Cakes in one
hand and a pot of ale in the other, which did give good occasion of
mirth, resembling her to the mayd that served us; we got home
very timely and well. And finding there all well, and letters from
Sea that speak of my Lord’s being well and his accion, though not
considerable of any side, at Argier, I went straight to my Lady and
there sat and talked with her; and so home again; and after supper,
we to bed somewhat weary.
