Lords day. By water to Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret, to give him
an account of the backwardnesse of the ships we have hired to
Portugall. At which he is much troubled. Thence to the Chappell
and there, though crowded, heard a very honest sermon before the
King by a Canon of Christ Church — upon these words: “Having a
forme of godliness but denying,”’ &c. Among other things, did
much insist upon the sin of adultery - which methought might
touch the King and the more because he forced it into his sermon,
methought besides his text. So up and saw the King at dinner; and
thence with Sir G. Carteret to his lodgings, to dinner with him and
his Lady — where I saluted her
— she seems a good lady. And all their
discourse, which was very much, was upon their sufferings and
services for the King.
