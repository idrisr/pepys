At the office all the morning. Much business and great hopes
of bringing things, by Mr. Coventry’s means, to a good condition
in the office. Dined at home, Mr. Hunt with us. To the office again
in the afternoon; but not meeting as was intended, I went to my
brother’s and booksellers and other places about business, and paid
off all for books to this day and do not entend to buy any more of
any kind a good while — thoughI had a great mind to have bought
the King’s works, as they are new-printed in folio, and present it to
my Lord. But I think it will be best to save the money. So home and
to bed.
