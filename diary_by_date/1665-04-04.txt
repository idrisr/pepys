Allthe morning at the office busy. At noon to the Change, and
then went up to the Change to buya pair of cotton stockings, which
I did at the husband’s shop of the most pretty woman there, who
did also invite me to buy some linen of her; and I was glad of the
occasion and bespoke some bands of her, entending to make her my
seamstress — she being one of the prettiest and most modest-looked
women that ever I did see. Dined at home; and to the office, where
very late, till I was ready to fall down asleep, and did several times
nod in the middle of my letters.
