Up, and to the office, where Comissioner Middleton first
took place at the Board as Surveyor of the Navy; and endeed I think
will be an excellent officer I am sure, much beyond what his
predecessor was. At noon, to avoid being forced to invite him to
dinner, it being his first day and nobody inviting him, Idid go to the
Change with Sir W. Penn in his coach, who first went to Guildhall,
whither I went with him — he to speak with Sheriffe Gawden, I only
for company; and did here look up and down this place, where I
have not been before since the fire, and I saw the City are going
apace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall. Thence to the Change,
where I stayed very little; and so away home to dinner and there
find my wife mightily out of order with her teeth. At the office all
the afternoon, and at night by coach to Westminster to the Hall,
where Imet nobody walking, and do find that this evening the King
by Message (which he never did before) hath passed several bills;
among others, that for the accounts and for banishing my Lord
Chancellor, and hath adjourned the House to February; at which I
am glad, hoping in this time to get leisure to state my Tanger
accounts and to prepare better for the Parliament’s enquiries.
