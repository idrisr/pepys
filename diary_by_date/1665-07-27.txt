Called up at 4 a-clock. Up, and to my preparing some papers
for Hampton Court; and so by water to Foxhall, and there Mr.
Gaudens coach took me up; and by and by I took up him, and so
both thither — a brave morning to ride in, and good discourse with
him. So despatched all my business, having assurance of con-
tinuance of all hearty love from Sir W. Coventry; and so we stayed
and saw the King and Queene set out toward Salsbury — and after
them, the‘Duke and Duchesse — whose hands I did kiss. And it was
the first time I did ever or did see anybody else kiss her hand; and it
was a most fine white and fat hand. But it was pretty to see the
young pretty ladies dressed like men; in velvet coats, caps with
ribbands, and with laced bands just like men — only, the Duchesse
herself it did not become. They gone, we with great content took
coach again. At home met the weekly Bill, where above 1000
encreased in the Bill; and of them, in all, about 1700 of the plague —
which hath made the officers this day resolve of sitting at Deptford,
which puts me to some consideration what to do. Therefore, home
to think and consider of everything about it; and without
determining anything, eat a little supper and to bed, full of the
pleasure of these six or seven last days.
