Lords day. To the Queen’s Chapel and there heard some good
singing; and so to Whitehall and saw the King and Queen at dinner;
and thence with Sir St. Fox to dinner, and the Cofferer with us, and
there mighty kind usage —and good discourse. Thence, spent all the
afternoon walking in the park; and then in the evening at Court, on
the Queen’s side, and there met Mr. Godolphin, who tells me that
the news is true we heard yesterday, of my Lord Sandwiches being
come to Mounts bay in Cornwall; and so I heard this afternoon at
Mrs. Pierce’s, whom I went to make a short visit to. This night, in
the Queen’s drawing-room, my Lord Brouncker told me the
difference that is now between the three Imbassadors here, the
Venetian, French, and Spaniard, the third not being willing to make
a visit to the first, because he would not receive him at the door.
