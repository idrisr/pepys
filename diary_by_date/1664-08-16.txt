Wakened about 2 a-clock this morning with the noise of
Thunder, which lasted for an hour; with such continued Lighten-
ings, not flashes but flames, that all the sky and ayre was light; and
that for a great while, not a minute’s space between new flames all
the time; sucha thing as Inever did see, nor could have believed had
ever been in nature. And being put into a great sweat with it, could
not sleep till all was over — and that accompanied with such a storm
of rain as I never heard in my life. |expected to find my house in the
morning overflowed with the rain breaking in, and that much hurt
must needs have been done in the City with this lightening; butI
find not one dropofrain in my house, nor any news of hurt done.
But it seems it hath been here and all up and down the counties
hereabouts, the like tempest — Sir W. Batten saying much of the
greatness thereof at Epsum.
