Atthe office till almost noon; and then broke up. Then came Sir
G. Carteret, and he and I walked together alone in the garden,
taking notice of some faults in the office, perticularly of Sir Wm.
Batten’s. And he seemed to be much pleased with me, and I hope
will be the ground of a future interest of mine in him, whichI shall
be glad of.
