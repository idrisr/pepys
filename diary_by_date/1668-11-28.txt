1668-11-28

Up, and all the morning at the office; where, while I was
sitting, one comes and tells me that my Coach is come — so I was
forced to go out; and to Sir Rd. Ford’s, where I spoke to him, and he
is very willing to have it brought in and stand there; and so Iordered
it, to my great content, it being mighty pretty; only, the horses do
not please me, and therefore resolve to have better. At noon home
to dinner; and so to the office again all the afternoon and did a great
967
deal of business; and so home to supper and to bed, with my mind at
pretty good ease, having this day presented to the Board the Duke
of York’s letter; which I perceive troubled Sir W. Penn, he
declaring himself meant in the part that concerned excuse by
sickness; but I do not care, but am mightily glad that it is done, and
now Ishall begin to be at pretty good ease in the office.
