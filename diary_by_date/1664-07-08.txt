To Paul’s churchyard about books — and to the binders and
directed the doing of my Chaucer, though they were not full neat
enough for me, but pretty well it is — and thence to the clasp-makers
to have it clasped and bossed. So to the Change and home to dinner,
and so to my office till 5 a-clock; and then came Mr. Hill and
Andrews and we sung an hour or two. Then broke up and Mr.
Alsop and his company came and consulted about our Tanger
victualling, and brought it to a good head. So they parted and I to
supper and to bed.
