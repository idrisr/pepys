Up, and mighty betimes to W. Coventry to give him an
account of yesterday’s work, which doth give him good content.
He did then tell me his speech lately to the House in his own
vindication, about the report of his selling of places — he having a
small occasion offered him by chance, which he did desire, and took
677
and did it to his content; and he says to the House’s seeming to
approveofit, by their hum. He confessed how long he had done it,
and how he desired to have something else;’ and since then he had
taken nothing, and challenged all the world. I was glad of this also.
Thence up to the Duke of York by appointment, with fellow-
officers, to complain, but to no purpose, of want of money; and so
away —I to Sir G. Carteret to his lodging, and there discoursed
much of the want of money and our being designed for destruction.
How the King hath lost his power by submitting himself to this
way of examining his accounts —and is become asa private man. He
says the King is troubled at it, but they talk an entry shall be made
that it is not to be brought into example. That the King must, ifthey
do not agree presently, make them a courageous speech; which he
says he may do (the City of London being now burned, and himself
master of an army) better then any prince before him — and so |
believe. Thence home about noon and to dinner. After dinner the
bookbinder came, and I sent by him some more books to gild. I to
the office all day, and spent most of it with W. Warren, whom I
have had no discourse with a great while. And when all is done, I do
find him a mighty wise man as any Iknow, and his counsel as much
to be fallowed. Late with Mr. Hayter, upon comparing the charge
and husbandry of the last Duch war with ours now; and do find
good room to think we have done little worse then they — whereof
good use may and will be made. So home to supper and to bed.
