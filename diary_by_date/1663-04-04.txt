Up betimes and to my office. Home to dinner whither by and
by comes Roger Pepys, Mrs. Turner, her daughter, Joyce Norton
and a young lady, a daughter of Coll. Cockes — my uncle Wight —
his wife and Mrs. Anne Wight —this being my feast, in lieu of what I
should have had a few days ago, for my cutting of the Stone, for
which the Lord make me truly thankful. Very merry before, at, and
after dinner, and the more for that my dinner was great and most
neatly dressed by our own only mayde. We had a Fricasse of rabbets
and chicken — a
leg of mutton boiled — three carps in a dish—a great
dish of a side of lamb — a dish roasted pigeons — a dish of four
lobsters — three tarts — a Lampry pie, a most rare pie — a dish of
anchoves — good wine of several sorts; and all things mighty noble
and to my great content. After dinner to Hide parke. At the parke
was the King, and in another coach my Lady Castlemayne, they
greeting one another at every Tour. Here about an hour; and so
leaving all by the way, we home and find the house as clean as if
nothing had been done there today from top to bottom — which
made us give the Cooke 12d. a piece, each of us.
