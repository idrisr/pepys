Lords day. My wife and I went into the office and there
measuredasilk flag that I have found there, and hope to get it to
myself, for it hath not been demanded since I came to the office. But
my wife is not hasty to have it, but rather to stay a while longer and
see the event, whether it will be missed or no.
