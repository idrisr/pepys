My wife not being well, waked in the night; and strange to see
how dead sleep our people sleeps, that she was fain to ring an hour
before anybody would wake. At last one rose and helped my wife;
and so to sleep again. Up, and to my business; and then to
Whitehall, there to attend the Lords Commissioners; and so
directly home and dined with Sir W. Batten and my Lady, and after
dinner had much discourse tending to profit with Sir W. Batten,
how to get ourselfs into the prize office, or some other fair way of
obliging the King to consider us in our extraordinary pains. Then to
the office, and there all the afternoon very busy, and so till past 12 at
night; and so home to bed. This day my wife went to the burial of a
little boy of W. Joyces.
