Lords day. Up, not to church but to my chamber, and there
begun to enter into this book myJou[r]nall of September, which in
the Fire time I could not enter here, but in loose papers. At noon
dined, and then to my chamber all the afternoon and night, looking
over and tearing and burning all the unnecessary letters which |
have had upon my File for four or five years backward — which |
entend to do quite through all my papers, that I may have nothing
by me but what is worth keeping, and fit to be seen ifI should
miscarry. At this work till midnight, and then to supper and to bed.
