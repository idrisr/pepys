Upandto the office, where after a while setting, Ileft the board
upon pretence of serious business and by coach to Paul’s schoole,
where I heard some good speeches of the boys that were to be
elected this year. Thence by and by with Mr. Pullen and Banes (a
great nonconformist) with several other of my old acquaintance to
the Nags head tavern and there did give them a bottle of sack; and
away again and I to the school and up to hear the upper form
examined; and there was kept by very many of the Mercers,
Clutterbucke, Barker, Harrington, and others, and with great
respect used by them all and had a noble dinner. Here they tell me
that in Dr. Colett’s Will he says that he would have a master found
for the school that hath good skill in Latin and (ifit could be) one
that had some knowledge of the Greeke; so little was Greek known
here at that time. Dr. Wilkins and one Mr. Smallwood, posers.
After great pleasure there, and especially to [hear] Mr. Crumlum so
often to tell of my being a benefactor to the school — I to my
booksellers and there spent an hour looking over Theatrum Urbium
and Flandria illustrata, with excellent cuts, with great content. So
homewards and called at my little Millener’s, where I chatted with
her, her husband out of the way, and a mad merry soul she is. So
home to the office; and by and by comes my wife home from the
burial of Capt. Groves wife at Wapping (she telling me a story how
her maid Jane, going into the boat, did fall down and show her arse
in the boat) and all; and comes my Uncle Wight and Mr. Maes with
the state of their case, which he told me very discreetly and I believe
is a very hard one. And so after drinking a bottle of ale or two, they
gone and Ialittle more to the office; and so home to prayers and to
bed.
