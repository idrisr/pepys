Lords day. Up betimes, and all the morning [in my chamber];
and then to dinner with my wife alone, and then all the afternoon in
like manner in my chamber, making up my Tanger accounts and
809
drawing a letter, which I have done at last to my full content, to
present to the Lords Commissioners for Tanger tomorrow. And
about 7 at night, when finished my letter and weary, I and my wife
and Mercer up by water to Barne elmes, where we walked by
Mooneshine; and called at Lambeth and drank, and had cold meat in
the boat, and did eat and sang, and down home by almost 12 at
night, very fine and pleasant; only, could not sing ordinary songs
with that freedom that otherwise I would. Here Mercer tells me
that the pretty maid of the Ship tavern I spoke of yesterday is
married there, which I am glad.of. So having spent this night with
much serious pleasure, to consider that I am in a condition to fling
away an angell in such a refreshment to myself and family, we
home and to bed, leaving Mercer by the way at her own door.
