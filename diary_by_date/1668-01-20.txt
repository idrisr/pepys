Up, and all the morning at the office very busy; and at noon
by coach to Westminster to the Chequer about a warrant for Tanger
money. In my way, both coming and going, I did stop at
Drumbleby’s the pipe-maker, there to advise about the making of a
flagelette to go low and saft; and he doth show mea way which doth
do, and alsoa fashion of having two pipes of the same note fastened
together, so as I can play on one and then echo it upon the other;
which is mighty pretty. So to my Lord Crew’s to dinner, where we
hear all the good news of our making a league now with Holland
against the French power coming over them or us, which is the first
good act that hath been done a great while, and done secretly and
with great seeming wisdom; and is certainly good for us at this
time, while we are in no condition to resist the French if he should
come over hither; and thena
little time of peace will give us time to
lay up something; which these Commissioners of the Treasury are
doing, and the world doth begin to see that they will do the King’s
work for him ifhe will let them. Here dined Mr. Case the Minister,
who, Lord, doth talk just as I remember he used to preach; and did
tell a pretty story ofa religious lady, the Queen of Navarre; and my
Lord also a good story of Mr. Newman, the minister in New
England who wrote the Concordance, of his foretelling his death
866
and preaching his funeral sermon, and did at last bid the Angells do
their office, and died. It seems there is great presumption that there
will be a Toleration granted; so that the presbyters do hold up their
heads, but they will hardly trust the King or the Parliament where
to yield to them — though most of the sober party be for some kind
of allowance to be given them.
