At Sir W. Battens with Sir W. Pen we drank our morning
draught, and from thence for an houre in the office and despatch a
little business. Dined at Sir W. Battens; and by this time I see that
we are like to have a very good correspondency and neighbour-
hood, but chargeable. All the afternoon at home looking over my
Carpenters. At night I called Tho. Hater out of the office to my
house to sit and talk with me. After he was gone, I caused the Girle
to wash the wainscote of our parler, which she did very well; which
caused my wife and I good sport. Up to my chamber to readalittle,
and write my Diary for three or four days past. The Duke of Yorke
did go today by break-of-day to the Downes. The Duke of
Glocester ill. To bed.
