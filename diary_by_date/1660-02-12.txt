Inthe morning, it being Lords day, Mr. Pierce came to me to
enquire how things go. We drank our morning draught together
and thence to Whitehall, where Dr. Homes preached; but I stayed
not to hear; but walking in the court, I heard that Sir Arth. Haslerig
was newly gone into the City to Monke and that Monkes wife
removed from Whitehall last night. Home again, where at noon
came according to my invitation my Cosen Tho. Pepys and his
partener, came and dined with me; but before dinner we went and
took a walk round the parke, it being a most pleasant day as ever I
saw. After dinner we three went into London together, where |
heard that Monke had been at Paul’s in the morning and the people
had shouted much at his coming out of the church. In the afternoon
he was at a church in Broad street, whereabout he doth lodge. But
not knowing how to see him, we'went and walked half an hour in
Moorefields, which was full of people, it being so fine a day. Hence
home where my wife and I had some high words upon my telling
her that I would fling the dog which her brother gave her out at the
window if he pissed the house any more.
