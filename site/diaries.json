I called at Mr.\nHarpers, who told me how Monke had this day clapped up many of\nthe Common Council, and that the Parliament had voted that he\nshould pull down their gates and portcullisses, their posts and their\nchains, which he doth entend to do, and doth lie in the City all\nnight. I went home and got some Allum to my mouth, where Ihave\nthe beginnings of a Cancre, and have also a plaster to my boyle\nunderneath my chin."

At noon I walked\nin the Hall, where I heard the news of a letter from Monke, who\nwas now gone into the City again and did resolve to stand for the\nsudden filling up of the House; and it was very strange how the\ncountenance of men in the Hall was all changed with joy in half an\n1. Dean Colet (d. 1519).\n14\n11 February 1660\nhour’s time. So I went up to the Lobby, where I saw the Speaker\nreading of the letter; and after it was read, Sir A. Haslerig came out\nvery angry. The House presently after rose, and appointed to meet\nagain at 3 a-clock. I went then down into the Hall, where Imet with\nMr. Chetwind, who had not dined no more then myself; and so we\nwent towards London, in our way calling at two or three shops, and\ncould have no dinner; at last, within Temple bar, we found a pullet\nready-roasted, and there we dined. After that, he went to his office\nin Chancery lane, calling at the Rolles, where I saw the lawyers\npleading; then to his office, where I sat in his study singing while he\nwas with his man (Mr. Powells son) looking after his business.\nThence we took coach for the City to Guildhall, where the hall was\nfull of people expecting Monke and Lord Mayor to come thither,\nand all very joyful. Here we stayed a great while; and at last,\nmeeting witha friend of his, we went to the Three Tun tavern and\ndrank half a pint of wine; and not liking the wine, we went to an\nalehouse, where we met with company of this third man’s\nacquaintance and there we dranka little: hence I went alone to\nGuildhall to see whether Monke was come yet or no, and met him\ncoming out of the chamber where he had been with the Mayor and\nAldermen; but such a shout I never heard in all my life, crying out\n“God bless your Excellence!” Here I met with Mr. Lock, and took\nhim to an alehouse and left him there to fetch Chetwind; when we\nwere come together, Lock told us the substance of the letter that\nwent from Monke to the Parliament: that he and his officers were\nput upon such offices against the City as they could not do with any\ncontent or honour. That there are many members now in the House\nthat were of the late tyrannical Committee of Safety. That Lambert\nand Vane are now in town, contrary to the vote of Parliament. That\ntherefore he doth desire that all writts for filling up of the House be\nissued by Friday next, and that in the meantime he would retire into\nthe City, only leave them guards for the security of the House and\nCouncil. The occasion of this was the order that he had last night to\ngo into the City and disarm them and take away their charter;\nwhereby he and his officers see that the House had a mind to put\nthem on things that should make them odious; and so it would be in\ntheir power to do what they would with them. He told us that the\nMayor and Aldermen had offered him their own houses for himself\nand his officers, and that his soldiers would lack for nothing. And\nendeed I saw many people give the soldiers drink and money, and\nall along in the streets cried, ‘God bless them!” and extraordinary\n1S\ngood words. In Cheapside there was a great many bonefires, and\nBow bells and all the bells in all the churches as we went home were\na-ringing. Hence we went homewards, it being about ro a-clock.\nBut the common joy that was everywhere to be seen! The number\nof bonefires — there being fourteen between St. Dunstan’s and\nTemple bar. And at Strand bridge I could at one view tell 31fires. In\nKing streete, seven or eight; and all along burning and roasting and\ndrinking for rumps — there being rumps tied upon sticks and carried\nup and down. The buchers at the maypole in the Strand rang a peal\nwith their knifes when they were going to sacrifice their rump. On\nLudgate hill there was one turning of the spit, that had a rump tied\nupon it, and another basting of it. Indeed, it was past imagination,\nboth the greatness and the suddenness ofit. At one end of the street,\nyou would think there was a whole lane of fire, and so hot that we\nwere fain to keep still on the further side merely for heat. Thence\nhome, and my wife and J went out again to show her the fires; and\nafter walking as far as the Exchange, we returned and to bed."

He likewise bade me look out\nnow, at this turn, some good place; and he would use all his own\nand all the interest of his friends that he hath in England to do me\ngood. And asked me whether I could without too much incon-\nvenience go to sea as his Secretary, and bade me think of it. He also\nbegin to talk of thingsofstate, and told me that he should now want\none in that capacity at sea that he might trust in. And therefore he\nwould have me to go. He told me also that he did believe the King\nwould come in, and did discourse with me about it and about the\naffection of the people and City — at which I was full glad. After he\nwas gone, I waiting upon him through the garden till he came to the\nHall, I left him and went up to my office, where Mr. Hawly\nbrought one to me, a seaman that had promised to! to himifhe gat\nhim a purser’s place, which I think to endeavour to do. While we\nwere drinking, in comes Mr. Day, a Carpenter in Westminster, to\ntell me that it was Shrove-tuesday and that I must go with him to\ntheir yearly club upon this day, which I confess I had quite forgot.\nSo I went to the Bell, where was Mr.’s Eglin, Veezy, Vincent a\nbutcher, one more, and Mr. Tanner, with whom I played upon a\nviall and he the viallin after dinner, and were very merry, with a\nspecial good dinner — a leg of veal and bacon, two capons and\nsausages and fritters, with abundance of wine. This day I hear that\n1. Orthodox Anglicanism: his mother appears to have inclined towards Puritanism.\n25\nthe Lords do entend to sit, and great store of them are now in town\nand I see in the Hall today. My Lord told me that there was great\nendeavours to bring in the Protector’ again; but he told me too,\nthat he did believe it would not last long if he were brought in; no,\nnor the King neither (though he seems to think that he will come\nin), unless he carry himself very soberly and well. Everybody now\ndrink the King’s health without any fear, whereas before it was very\nprivate that a man dare do it. My mind, I must needs remember,\nhath been very much eased and joyed in my Lord’s great expression\nof kindness this day; and in discourse thereupon, my wife and I lay\nawake an hour or two in our bed."

The\ncontents of the letter are his offer of grace to all that will come in\nwithin 40 days, only excepting them that the Parliament shall\nhereafter except. That the sales of lands during these troubles, and\nall other things, shall be left to the Parliament, by which he will\nstand. The letter dated at Breda, April; 1660, in the 12th year of\nhis\nRaigne. Upon the receipt of it this morning by an express, Mr.\nPhillips, one of the messengers of the Council from Gen. Monke,\nmy Lord summoned a council of war, and in the meantime did\ndictate to me how he would have the vote ordered which he would\nhave pass this council. Which done, the commanders all came on\nboard, and the council set in the coach (the first council of war that\nhath been in my time), where I read the letter and declaration; and\nwhile they were discoursing upon it, I seemed* to draw up a vote;\nwhich being offered, they passed. Not one man seemed to say no to\nit, though I am confident many in their hearts were against it. After\nthis was done, I went up to the Quarter-deck with my Lord and the\n39\ncommanders, and there read both the papers and the vote; which\ndone, and demanding their opinion, the seamen did all of them cry\nout “God bless King Charles!”’ with the greatest joy imaginable.\nThat being done, Sir R. Stayner, who had invited us yesterday,\ntook all the commanders and myself on board him to dinner; where\ndinner not being ready, I went with Capt. Hayward to the Plimouth\nand Essex, and did what I had to do there and returned, where very\nmerry at dinner. After dinner, to the rest of the ships (Istayed at the\nAssistance to hear the harper a good while) quite through the fleet.\nWhich was a very brave sight, to visit all the ships and to be received\nwith the respect and Honour that I was on board them all. And\nmuch more to see the great joy that I brought to all men; not one\nthrough the whole fleet showing the least dislike of the business. In\nthe evening, as I was going on board the Vice-Admirall, the\nGenerall begun to fire his guns, which he did all that he had in the\nship; and so did all the rest of the commanders, which was very\ngallant, and to hear the bullets go hissing over our heads as we were\nin the boat. This done and finished my Proclamation, I returned to\nthe Nazeby, where my Lord was much pleased to hear how all the\nfleet took it; and in a transport ofjoy showed meaprivate letter of\nthe King’s to him and another from the Duke of Yorke in such\nfamiliar style as to their common friend, with all kindness\nimaginable. And I found by the letters, and so my Lord told me too,\nthat there hath been many letters sped between them for a great\nwhile, and I perceive unknown to Monke. The King speaks of his\nbeing courted to come to The Hague, but doth desire my Lord’s\nadvice whether to come to take ship. And the Duke offers to learn\nthe seaman’s tradeof him, in such familiar words as ifJack Cole and\nI had writ them. This was very strange to me, that my Lord should\ncarry all things so wisely and prudently as he doth, and I was over-\njoyful to see him in so good condition; and he did nota little please\nhimself to tell me how he had provided for himself so great a hold in\nthe King."

Mr Cooke came\nafter us in the Yarmouth, bringing me a letter from my wife and a\nLatin letter from my brother Jo:, with both which I was exceed-\ningly pleased. No sermon all day, we being under sail; only at\nnight, prayers, wherein Mr. Ibbott prayed for all that were related\nto us in a spiritual and fleshly way.\n14-15. Inthe morning, when I waked and rose, I saw myself out\nof the Scuttle close by the shore, which afterwards I was told to be\nthe Duch shore. The Hague was clearly to be seen by us. My Lord\nwent up in his night gowne into the Cuddy to see how to dispose\nthereof for himself and us that belong to him, to give order for our\nremovall today. Some masty Duchmen came on board to proffer\ntheir boats to carry things from us on shore &c., to get money by\nus. Before noon, some gentlemen came on board from the shore to\nkiss my Lords hands. And by and by Mr. North and Dr. Clerke\nwent to kiss the Queen of Bohemia’s hands from my Lord, with a\ndozen of attendants from on board to wait on them; among which I\nsent my boy — who, like myself, is with child to see any strange\nthing. After noon they came back again, having kissed the Queen of\n43\nBohemia’s hand, and was sent again by my Lord to do the same to\nthe Prince of Orange. SoI got the Captain to ask leave for me to go,\nwhich my Lord did give; and I, taking my boy and Judge-Advocate\n[Fowler] with me, went in company with them. The weather bad;\nwe were soundly washed when we came near the shore, it being\nvery hard to land there. The shore is, as all the country between that\nand The Hague, all sand.

Mr. Creed and I went in the fore-part of a coach,\nwherein there was two very pretty ladies, very fashionable and with\nblack paches, who very merrily sang all the way and that very well.\nAnd were very free to kiss the two blades that were with them. I\ntook out my Flagelette and piped, but in piping Idropped my rapier\nstick; but when I came to The Hague, Isent my boy back again for it\nand he found it, for which I gave him 6d., but some horse had gone\nover it and broke the scabbard. The Hague is a most neat place in all\nrespects. Here we walked up and down agreat while, the town\nbeing now very full of Englishmen.\nBut going to see the Prince, he was gone forth with his Governor;\nand so we walked up and down the town and Court to see the place;\nand by the help of a stranger, an Englishman, we saw a great many\nplaces and were made to understand many things, as the intention\nof the Maypoles which we saw there standing at every great man’s\ndoor, of different greatness according to the Quality of the person.\nAbout ro at night the Prince comes home, and we found an easy\nadmission. His attendance very inconsiderable as for a prince. But\nyet handsome, and his tutor a fine man and himself a very pretty\nboy. It was bright Mooneshine tonight. This done, we went to a\nplace we had taken up to sup in — where a sallet and two or three\nbones of mutton were provided for a matter of ten of us, which was\nvery strange. After supper the Judge and I to another house to bed,\nleaving them there; and he and Ilying together in one of their press-\nbeds, there being two more in the same room, but all very neat and\nhandsome; and my boy sleeping upon a bench by me, we lay till\npast 3 a-clock; and then rise and up and down the town to see it by\ndaylight. Where we saw soldiers of the Prince’s guard, all very fine,\nand the Burgers of the town with their arms and musquets as bright\nas silver; I meeting this morning a Schoole-Master that spoke good\nEnglish and French, he went along with us and showed us the\nwhole town. And indeed, I cannot speak enough of the gallantry of\nthe town. Everybody of fashion speak French or Latin, or both.\nThe women, many of them very pretty and in good habitt,\n44\nfashionable, and black spots. He went with me to buy a couple of\nbasketts, one of them for Mrs. Pierce, the other for my wife. After\nhe was gone (we having first drank with him at our lodging), the\nJudge and I go the grand Salle, where we were showed the place\nwhere the States-generall sit in council. The hall is a great place,\nwhere the flags that they take from their enemies are all hung up.\nAnd things to be sold, as in Westminster hall, and not much unlike\nit but that not being so big — but much neater. After this to a\nbookseller’s and bought, for the love of the binding, three books —\nthe French Psalms in four parts, Bacon’s organon and Farnaby’s\nRhetoric.\nComing on board, we found all the Commissioners of the House\nof Lords at dinner with my Lord; who after dinner went away for\nshore. In the afternoon my Lord called me on purpose to show me\nhis fine clothes which are now come hither; and indeed, are very\nrich—as gold and silver can make them. Only his sword he and I do\nnot like. In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in the\nCoach two houres, talking together upon all sorts of discourse — as\nReligion, wherein he is I perceive wholly Scepticall, as well as I,\nsaying that indeed the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are\nwholly fanatiques.

She would fain see me and be at her house again, but we must\nbe content. She writes me word how the Joyces go very rich and\ngrow very Proud; but it is no matter. And that there was a talk that I\nshould be knighted by the King; which they laugh at, but I think\nmyself happier in my wife and estate then they are in theirs. To bed.\n2. Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his\nCabbin, I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the\nshare that he had given me of his Majestys money and the Dukes.\nHe told me that he hoped to do me a more lasting kindness, if all\nthings stand as they are now between him and the King — but says\n“We must havealittle patience and we will rise together. In the\nmeantime I will do you all the good Jobbs I can.”” Which was great\ncontent for me to hear from my Lord. All the morning with the\nCaptain, computing how much the 30 ships that came with the\nKing from Scheveling their pay comes to for a month (because the\nKing promised to give them all a month’s pay) and it comes to\n65381: and the Charles perticularly, 777]. I wish we had the money.\nAll the afternoon with two or three captains in the Captain’s cabin,\ndrinking of white wine and sugar and eating pickled oysters —\nwhere Capt. Sparling told us the best Story that ever I heard; about\n$3\na gentleman that persuaded a country fellow to let him gut his\noysters or else they would stink."

But my Lord St. Albans and the Queene and Abbot\n117\nMountagu did waylay them at their lodgings till the difference was\nmade up, much to my Lord’s honour, who hath got great\nreputation thereby."

By and by we came to two little girls keeping cowes; and I\nsaw one of them very pretty, so had a minde to make her aske my\nblessing. And telling that I was her godfather, she asked me\ninnocently whether I was not Ned Wooding, andI said that I was;\nso she kneeled down and very simply cried, “Pray, godfather, pray\nto God to bless me” — which made us very merry and I gave her\ntwopence. In several places I asked women whether they would\nSell me their children; that they denied me all, but said they would\ngive me one to keep for them if I would."

I did give the midwife 10s. and the nurse $s.\nand the maid of the house 2: but for as much as Iexpected to give the\nname to the Childe, but did not, it being called John, I forbore then\nto give my plate — till another time, after a little more advice. All\nbeing done, we went to Mrs. Shipmans, who is a great butter-\nwoman; and I did see there the most of milke and cream, and the\ncleanest, that ever I saw in my life. After we had filled our bellies\nwith cream, we took our leaves and away. In our way we had great\nsport to try who should drive fastest, Sir W. Batten’s coach or Sir\nW. Pen’s charriot, they having four and we two horses, and we beat\nthem. But it cost me the spoiling of my clothes and velvet coate\nwith dirt.

This day I hear the parliament hath ordered a bill to be\nbrought in for the restoring the Bishops to the House of Lords —\nwhich they had not done so soon but to spite Mr. Prynne, who is\nevery day so bitter against them in his discourse in the House.\n—#JUNE-\n1. Saturday. Having taken our leaves of Sir W. Batten and my\nLady, who are gone this morning to Chatham to keep their\nWhitsuntide, Sir W. Penn and I and Mr. Gauden by water to\nWoolwich; and there went from ship to ship to give order for and\ntake notice of their forwardness to go forth. And then to Deptford\nand did the like — having dined at Woolwich with Capt. Poole at the\ntaverne there. From Deptford we walked to Redriffe, calling at the\nHalfway house; and there came into a room where there was\n1. Batten’s sister.\n137\ninfinite of new cakes placed, that are made against Whitsuntide; and\nthere we were very merry. By water home and there did businesses\nof the office.

Which I am sorry for — and do see the inconvenience that\n161\n1661 30 October—4 November\ndoth attend the increase of a man’s fortune, by being forced to keep\nmore servants, which brings trouble.\n-%NOVEMBER#-\n2. At the office all the morning; where Sir John Minnes our new\nComptroller was fetched by Sir Wm. Pen and myself from Sir W.\nBattens and led to his place in the office — the first time that he hath\ncome hither. And he seems a good fair-condition[ed] man and one\nthat Iam glad hath the office. This night my boy Wainman, as Iwas\nin my chamber, [I] overheard him let off some Gunpouder; and\nhearing my wife chide him below for it, anda noise made, Icall him\nup and find that it was powder that he had put in his pocket, and a\nmach carelessely with it, thinking that it was out; and so the match\ndid give fire to the powder and had burned his side and his hand,\nthat he put into his pocket to put out the fire. But upon\nexamination, and finding him in a lie about the time and place that\nhe bought it, I did extremely beat him. And though it did trouble\nme to do it, yet I thought it necessary to do it. So to write by the\npost, and to bed.\n3. Lords day. This day I stirred not out, but took physique and it\ndid work very well; and all the day, as I was at leisure, I did read in\nFuller’s Holy Warr (which Ihave of late bought) and did try to make\na Song in the prayse of a Liberall genius (as I take my own to be) to\nall studies and pleasures; but it not proving to my mind, I did reject\nit and so proceeded not in it. At night my wife and I had a good\nsupper by ourselfs, of a pullet hashed; which pleased me much to\nsee my condition come to allow ourselfs a dish like that. And so at\nnight to bed.\n4. Inthe morning, being very rainy, by Coach with Sir W. Penn\nand my wife to Whitehall; and sent her to Mrs. Hunts, and he and I\nto Mr. Coventry about business; and so sent for her again, and all\nthree home again; only, I to the Miter (Mr. Rawlinson’s), where\nMr. Pierce the purser had got us a most rare Chine of beef and a dish\nof marrow bones. Our Company, my Uncle Wight, Capt.\nLambert, one Capt. Doves, and purser Barber, Mr. Rawlinson,\nand ourselfs — and very merry. After dinner I took Coach and called\n162\nmy wife at my brother’s, where I left her; and to the Opera, where\nwe saw The Bondman, which of old we both did so doate on, and do\nso still; though, to both our thinking, not so well acted here (having\ntoo great expectacions) as formerly at Salsbury Court — but for\nBaterton; he is called by us both the best actor in the world. So\nhome by coach, I lighting by the way at my uncle Wights and\nstayed therea little, and so home after my wife. And to bed."

But Boreman, who had been\nupon the Scaffold, came to us and told us that first he begun to speak\nof the irregular proceeding against him; that he was, against Magna\nCharta, denied to have his excepcions against the Endictment\nallowed.

But then it pleased God to lay a foundacion of\nGrace in his heart, by which he was persuaded against his worldly\ninterest to leave all preferment and go abroad, where he might serve\nGod with more freedom. Then he was called home and made a\nmember of the Long parliament; where he never did, to this day,\nanything against his conscience, but all for the glory of God. Here\nhe would have given them an account of the proceedings of the\nLong parliament, but they so often interrupted him, that at last he\nwas forced to give over; and so fell into prayer for England in\nGenerall, then for the churches in England, and then for the City of\nLondon. And so fitted himself for the block and received the blow.\nHe had a blister or Issue upon his neck, which he desired them not\nto hurt. He changed not his colour or speech to the last, but died\njustifying himself and the cause he had stood for; and spoke very\nconfidently of his being presently at the right hand of Christ.

Up very earely, this being the last Sunday that the\nPresbyterians are to preach, unless they read the new Comon\n218\n17 August 1662\nPrayer and renounce the Covenant,'and so Ihad a mind to hear Dr.\nBates’s farewell sermon, and walked to St. Dunstans, where, it\nbeing not 7 a-clock yet, the doors were not open; and so I went and\nwalked an hour in the Temple garden, reading my vows; which it is\na great content to me to see how I am a changed man, in all respects\nfor the better, since I took them — which the God of Heaven\ncontinue to me and make me thankful for. At 8 a-clock I went and\ncrowded in at a back door among others, and the church being half-\nfull almost before any doors were open publicly. And so got into\nthe Gallry besides the pulpit and heard very well. His text was,\n‘Now the god of peace’ — the last Hebrews and the 20 verse — he\nmaking a very good sermon and very little reflections in it to\nanything of the times. Besides the sermon, I was very well pleased\nwith the sight ofa fine lady that Ihave often seen walk in Grayes Inn\nwalks. After dinner to St. Dunstan’s again, and the church quite\ncrouded before I came, which was just at one a-clock; but I got into\nthe gallery again, but stood in a crowd and did exceedingly sweat all\nthe while. He pursued his text again very well, and only at the\nconclusion told us after this manner — “I do believe that many of\nyou do expect that I should say something to you in reference to the\ntime, this being the last time that possibly I may appear here. You\nknow it is not my manner to speak anything in the pulpit that is\nextraneous to my text and business. Yet this I shall say, that it is not\nmy opinion, faction, or humour that keeps me from complying\nwith what is required of us, but something which after much\nprayer, discourse and study yet remains unsatisfied and commands\nme herein. Wherefore, if it is my unhappinesse not to receive such\nan illuminacion as should direct me to do otherwise, I know no\nreason why men should not pardon me in this world, and am\nconfident that God will pardon me for it in the next.”” And so he\nconcluded. I hear most of the Presbyters took their leaves today.\nAnd the City is much dissatisfied with it. I pray God keep peace\namong us and make the Bishops careful of bringing in good men in\ntheir room, or else all will fly a-pieces; for bad ones will not down\nwith the City.\n1. According to the terms of the Act of Uniformity passed in May. As a result\nabout a thousand parsons were extruded from their livings, fifty or so in London\nand Westminster alone. The Covenant (1643) was an attempt to impose\nPresbyterianism on the Church of England as the price of Scottish help to\nParliament in the Civil War.\n219"

The last of\nwhich is a very great fault of mine, which I must amend in.\nThence by boat.

Among other\ndiscourses, one Mr. Oudant, Secretary to the late Princesse of\nOrange, did discourse of the convenience as to keeping the\nhighways from being deep, by their horses in Holland (and\nFlanders, where the ground is as miry as ours is) going in their carts\n232\nand waggons, as ours in coaches.' Wishing the same here, as an\nexpedient to make the ways better; and Ithink there is something in\nit, where there is breadth enough."

All the\nway, he talking very ingenuously; and I find him a fine gentleman\nand one that loves to live nobly and neatly, as I perceive by his\ndiscourse of his house, pictures, and horses. He brought me first to\nthe Duke’s chamber, where I saw him and the Duchesse at supper,\nand thence into the room where the Ball was to be, crammed with\n245\n1662 31 December\nfine ladies, the greatest of the Court. By and by comes the King and\nQueen, the Duke and Duchesse, and all the great ones; and after\nseating themselfs, the King takes out the Duchess of Yorke, and the\nDuke the Duchesse of Buckingham, the Duke of Monmouth my\nLady Castlemayne, and so other lords other ladies; and they danced\nthe Bransle. After that, the King led a lady a single Coranto; and\nthen the rest of the lords, one after another, other ladies. Very noble\nit was, and great pleasure to see. Then to Country dances; the King\nleading the first which he called for; which was— says he, Cuckolds\nall a-row, the old dance of England. Of the ladies that danced, the\nDuke of Monmouth’s mistress and my Lady Castlemayne and a\ndaughter of Sir Harry De Vickes were the best. The manner was,\nwhen the King dances, all the ladies in the room, and the Queen\nherself, stands up; and endeed he dances rarely and much better then\nthe Duke of Yorke. Having stayed here as long as I thought fit, to\nmy infinite content, it being the greatest pleasure I could wish now\nto see at Court, I went out, leaving them dancing.\nThus ended this year, with great mirth to me and my wife. Our\ncondition being thus — we are at present spending a night or two at\nmy Lord’s lodgings at Whitehall. Our home at the Navy office —\nwhich is and hath a pretty while been in good condition, finished\nand made very convenient. My purse is worth about 6501 — besides\nmy goodsofall sorts— which yet might have been more but for my\nlate layings-out upon my house and public assessment, and yet\nwould not have been so much ifI had not lived a very orderly life all\nthis year, by virtue of the oaths that God put into my heart to take\nagainst wine, plays, and other expenses, and to observe for these\nlast twelve months — and which I am now going to renew, I under\nGod oweing my present content therunto. My family* is myself\nand wife— Wm. my clerk—Jane, my wife’s upper-maid; but I think\ngrowing proud and negligent upon it, we must part; which troubles\nme — Susan our cook-maid, a pretty willing wench but no good\ncook — and Waynman my boy, who I am now turning away for his\nnaughty tricks. We have had from the beginning our hea!ths to this\nday, very well, blessed be God. Our late mayde Sarah going from\nus (though put away by us) to live with Sir W. Penn doth trouble\nme, though I love the wench — so that we do make ourselfs a little\nstrange to him and his family for it, and resolve to do so. We have\nlately had it in our thoughts, and I can hardly bring myself off of it\nsince Mrs. Gosnell cannot be with us, to find out another to be in\nthe quality ofa Woman to my wife, that can sing or dance. And yet\n246\n31 December 1662\nfinding it hard to save anything at the year’s end as I now live, I\nthink I shall not be such a fool — till 1am more warm in my purse;\nbesides my oath of entering into no such expenses till I am worth\n10001. By my last year’s diligence in my office, blessed be God, Iam\ncome to a good degree of knowledge therein; and am acknow-\nledged so by all the world, even the Duke himself, to whom Ihavea\ngood accesse, and by that and my being Comissioner with him for\nTanger, he takes much notice of me, and I doubt not but by the\ncontinuance of the same endeavours I shall ina\nlittle time come to be\na man much taken notice of in the world-— especially, being come to\nso great an esteem with Mr. Coventry. The only weight that lies\nheavy upon my mind is the ending the business with my uncle\nThomas about my dead uncles estate, which is very ill on our side;\nandI fear, when all is done, I must be forced to maintain my father\nmyself, or spare a good deal towards it out of my own purse —\nwhich will be a very great pull-backe to me in my fortune. But I\nmust be contented and bring it to an issue one way or other.\nPublic matters stand thus. The King is bringing, as is said, his\nfamily and Navy and all other his charges to a less expense. In the\nmeantime, himself fallowing his pleasures more then with good\nadvice he would do —at least, to be seen to all the world to do so—his\ndalliance with my Lady Castlemayne being public every day, to his\ngreat reproach. And his favouring of none at Court so much as\nthose that are the confidants of his pleasure as Sir H. Bennet and Sir\n_ Ch. Barkely — which good God put it into his heart to mend -\nbefore he makes himself too much contemned by his people for it.\nThe Duke of Monmouth is in so great splendour at Court and so\ndandled by the King, that some doubt, if the King should have no\nchild by the Queene (which there is yet no appearance of),whether\nhe would not be acknowledged for a lawful son. And that there will\na difference fallow upon it between the Duke of York — and him —\nwhich God prevent. My Lord Chancellor is threatened by people to\nbe Questioned, the next sitting of the parliament, by some spirits\nthat do not love to see him so great. But certainly he is a good\nservant to the King. The Queene Mother is said to keep too great a\nCourt now; and her being married to my Lord St. Albans is\ncommonly talked of, and that they had a daughter between them in\nFrance. How true, God knows.’ The Bishopps are high and go on\nwithout any diffidence in pressing uniformity; and the Presbyters\n1. See above, pp. 235—6 (22 November) & n.\n247\n1662 31 December\nseem silent in it and either conform or lay down, though without\ndoubt they expect a turn and would be glad these endeavours of the\nother Fanatiques would take effect — there having beena plot lately\nfound, for which four have been publicly tried at the old Bayly and\nhanged. My Lord Sandwich is still in good esteem, and now\nkeeping his Christmas in the country. And I in good esteem, I\nthink, as any man can be with him. In fine, for the good condition\nof myself, wife, family and estate, in the great degree that it is, and\nfor the public state of the nation, so quiet as it is, the Lord God be\npraised.\n248\nwe\n6 cosBe\nte\n—% JANUARY#-\n1. Lay with my wife at my Lord’s lodgings, where I have been\nthese two nights, till ro a-clock with great pleasure talking; and\nthen I rose. And to Whitehall, where I spenta little time walking\namong the Courtiers, which I perceive I shall be able to do with\ngreat confidence, being now beginning to be pretty well-known\namong them. Then to my wife again and dined, Mrs. Sarah with\nus, in the chamber we lay in. Among other discourse, Mrs. Sarah\ntells us how the King sups at least four or [five] times every week\nwith my Lady Castlemayne; and most often stays till the morning\nwith her and goes home through the garden all alone privately, and\nthat so as the very Centry’s take notice of it and speakofit. She tells\nme that about a month ago she quickened at my Lord Gerrards at\ndinner and cried out that she was undone; and all the lords and men\nwere fain to quit the room, and women called to help her. In fine, I\nfind that there is nothing almost but bawdry at Court from top to\nbottom, as if it were fit I could instance, but it is not necessary.\nOnly, they say my Lord Chesterfield, Groom of the Stole to the\nQueene, is either gone or put away from Court upon the score of\nhis lady’s having smitten the Duke ofYork, so as that he is watched\nby the Duchesse of Yorke and the lady is retired into the country\nupon it. How much of this is true, God knows, but it is common\ntalk. After dinner Idid reckon with Mrs. Sarah for what we have eat\nand drank here, and gave her a crowne; and so took coach and to the\nDuke’s house, where we saw The Villaine again; and the more I see\nit, the more Iam offended at my first undervaluing the play, it being\nvery good and pleasant and yet a true and allowable Tragedy. The\nhouse was full of Citizens and so the less pleasant, but that I was\nwilling to make an end of my gaddings and to set to my business for\nall the year again tomorrow.\n4. Lords day. Up and to church, where a lazy sermon. And so\nhome to dinner to a good piece of powdered beef, buta little too\n249\nsalt. At dinner my wife did propound my having of my sister Pall at\nmy house again to be her Woman, since one we must have — hoping\nthat in that quality possibly she may prove better than she did\nbefore. Which I take very well of her, and will consider of it — it\nbeing a very great trouble to me that I should haveasister of so ill a\nnature that I must be forced to spend money upona stranger, when\nit might better be upon her if she were good for anything."

Batten’s house and out of one of their\nwindows spoke to my wife out of one of ours — which methought,\nthough I did it in mirth, yet I was sad to think what a sad thing it\nwould be for me to be really in that condition. By and by comes\nSir\nJ.Mennes, who (like himself and all that he doth) tells us that\nhe can do no good, but that my Lord Chancellor wonders that we\ndid not cause the seamen to fall about their eares — which we\nwished we could have done without our being seen in it; and\nCapt. Grove being there, he did give them some affront and\nwould have got some seamen to have drubbed them,but he had\nnot time nor did we think it fit to have it done, they having\nexecuted their commission. But there was occasion given that he\ndid draw his sword upon one of them and he did complain that\nGrove had pricked him in the breast — but no hurt done; but I saw\nthat Grove would have done our business to them if we had bid\nhim. By and by comes Mr. Clerke our Sollicitor, who brings us a\nrelease from our adverse atturny, we paying the fees of the\nComission, which comes to five markes, and pay the charges of\nthese fellows, which are called the Comissioners (but are the most\nrake-shamed rogues that ever I saw in my life); so he showed them\nhis release and [they] seemed satisfied and went away with him to\ntheir atturny to be paid by him. But before they went, Sir W.\nBatten and my Lady did begin to taunt them; but the rogues\nanswered them as high as themselfs and swore they would come\nagain, and called me rogue and Rebell and they would bring the\nSheriffe and untile his house before he should harbour a Rebell in\nhis house — and that they would be here again shortly. Well, at last\nthey went away; and I by advice took occasion to go abroad, and\nwalked through the street to show myself among the neighbours,\nthat they might not think worse then the business is."

He being gone, I to the office; where at the choice\nof Maisters and Chyrurgeons for the fleet now going out, I did my\nbusiness as I couid wish, both for the persons I have a mind to serve\nand in getting the warrants signed drawn by my clerks, which Iwas\nafeared of. Sat late; and having done, I went home; where I find\nMary Ashwell come to live with us, of whom I hope well and pray\nGod she may please us — which though it cost me something, yet\nwill give me much content. So to supper and to bed. And find by\nher discourse and carriage tonight, that she is not proud but will do\nwhat she is bid; but for want of being abroad, knows not how to\ngive that respect to her mistress as she will do when she is told it —\nshe having been used only to little children, and there was a kind ofa\n262\nmistress over them.

Batten (who came to town last\nnight) from going to that end today, lest he might doe it to Sir G.\nCarteret or Mr. Coventry before me- which I did prevail, and kept\nhim at the office all the morning.

After that, to\nsome other discourse; and among other things, talking of the way\nof ordinaries, that it is very convenient because a man knows what\nhe hath to pay, one did wish that among many bad, we could learn\ntwo good things of France — which were that we would not think it\nbelow the gentleman or person of honour at a taverne to bargain for\nhis meat before he eats it; and next, to take no servants without\nCertificate from some friend or gentleman of his good behaviour\nand abilities."

Thence to Mr.\nCoventry ; and sitting by his bedside, he did tell me that he sent for\nme to discourse upon my Lord Sandwiches allowances for his\nseveral pays, and what his thoughts are concerning his demands;\nwhich he could not take the freedom to do face to face, it being not\nso proper as by me; and did give me a most friendly and ingenious\naccount of all. After done with him about those things, he told me\nthat for Mr. Hater, the Dukes word was, in short, that he found he\nhad a good servant, an Anabaptist; and unless he did carry himself\nmore to the scandall of the office, he would bear with his opinion till\nhe heard further — which doth please me very much. To dinner with\n274\n[my Lord], there dining there my Lord Mountagu of Boughton,\nMr Wm. Mountague his brother, the Queen’s Sollicitor, &c.; anda\nfine dinner. Their talk about a ridiculous falling-out two days ago at\nmy Lord of Oxfords house at an entertainment of his, there being\nthere my Lord of Albemarle, Lynsey, two of the Porters, my Lord\nBellasse[s], and others; where there was high words and some\nblows and pulling off of perriwiggs — till my Lord Monke took\naway some of their swords and sent for some soldiers to guard the\nhouse till the fray was ended. To such a degree of madness the\nnobility of this age is come.\nAfter dinner I went up to Sir Tho. Crew, who lies there not very\nwell in his head, being troubled with vapours and fits of dizzinesse;\nand there I sat talking with him all the afternoon, from one\ndiscourse to another. The most was upon the unhappy posture of\nthings at this time; that the King doth mind nothing but pleasures\nand hates the very sight or thoughts of business. That my Lady\nCastlemayne rules him; who he says hath all the tricks of Aretin that\nare to be practised to give pleasure. It seems the present favourites\nnow are my Lord Bristoll, Duke of Buckingham, Sir H. Bennet,\nmy Lord Ashley, and Sir Ch. Berkely; who among them have cast\nmy Lord Chancellor upon his back, past ever getting up again; there\nbeing now little for him to do, and waits at court attending to speak\nto the King as others do. My Lord Albemarle, I hear, doth bear\nthrough and bustle among them and will not be removed from the\nKing’s good opinion and favour, though none of the Cabinett; but\nyet he is envied enough. It is made very doubtful whether the King\ndoth not entend the making of the Duke of Monmouth legitimate;\nbut surely the Commons of England will never do it nor the Duke\nof Yorke suffer it— whose lady I am told is very troublesome to him\nby her jealousy. Having thus freely talked with him and of many\nmore things, I took leave; and by coach to St. James’s and there told\nMr. Coventry what I had done with my Lord, with great\nsatisfaction; and so, well pleased, home — where I find it almost\nnight and my wife and the Dancing Maister alone above, not\ndancing but walking. Now, so deadly full ofjealousy Iam, that my\nheart and head did so cast about and fret, that I could not do any\nbusiness possibly, but went out to my office; and anon late home\nagain, and ready to chide at everything; and then suddenly to bed\nand could hardly sleep, yet durst not say anything."

And so kissing her often and Ashwell once, I bid\nthem Adieu; and so home by coach and thence by water to\nDeptford to the Trinity house, where I came alittle late but I found\nthem reading their charter; which they did like fools, only reading\nhere and there a bit, whereas they ought to do it all, every word; and\nthen proceeded to the Eleccion of a Maister, which was Sir W.\nBatten, who made a heavy, short speech to them, moving them to\ngive thanks to the late Maister for his pains, which he said was very\ngreat, and giving them thanks for their choice of him, wherein he\nwould serve them to the best of his power. Then to the choice of\ntheir Assistants and Wardens, and so rose.

Both at and after dinner we\nhad great discourses of the nature and power of Spirits and whether\nthey can animate dead bodies; in all which, as of the general\nappearing of spirits, my Lord Sandwich is very scepticall. He says\nthe greatest warrants that ever he had to believe any, is the present\nappearing of the Devil in Wiltshire, much of late talked of, who\nbeats a drum up and down; there is books of it, and they say very\ntrue. But my Lord observes that though he doth answer to any tune\nthat you will play to him upon another drum, yet one tune he tried\nto play and could not; which makes him suspect the whole, and I\nthink it is a good argument. Sometimes they talked of handsome\nwomen; and Sir J. Mennes saying that there was no beauty like\nwhat he sees in the country-markets, and especially at Bury, in\nwhich I will agree with him that there is a prettiest woman I ever\nsaw — my Lord replied: ““Why, Sir John, what do you think of your\nneighbour’s wife?” looking upon me, “do not you think that he\nhath a great beauty to his wife? Upon my word he hath!” — whichI\n287\nwas nota little proud of. Thence by Barge along with my Lord to\nBlackefryers, where he landed; and I thence walked home, where\nvexed to find my boy (whom I boxed at his coming for it) and Will\nabroad, though he was but upon tower hill a very little while.

At last, I found out a delicate walk in the middle that goes\nquite through the wood; and then went out of the wood and\nhallowed Mr. Creede and made him hunt me from place to place;\nand at last went in and called him into my fine walk — the little dog\nstill hunting with us through the wood. In this walk, being all\nbewildred and weary and sweating, Creed, he lay down upon the\nground; whichI\ndid alittle but durst not long, but walked from him\nin the fine green walk, which is half'a mile long, there reading my\nvowes as I used to on Sundays. To Yowel and there set up our\nhorses and selfs for all night."

But it being much a warmer day then yesterday, there\nwas great store of gallant company, more then then to my greater\npleasure. There was at a distance, under one of the trees on the\ncommon, a company got together that sung; I, at that distance, and\nso all the rest, being a quarter of a mile off, took them for the\nwaytes; so I rid up to them and find them only voices — some\nCitizens, met by chance, that sing four or five parts excellently. I\nhave not been more pleased with a snapp of Musique, considering\nthe circumstances of the time and place, in all my life anything so\npleasant. We drank each of us three cups; and so after riding up to\nthe horsemen upon the Hill where they were making of matches to\nrun — we went away and to Yowell, where we find our Breakefast,\nthe remains of our supper last night hasht. And by and by, after the\nsmith had set on two new shoos to Creedes horse — we mounted;\nand with little discourse, I being intent upon getting home in time,\nwe rode hard home. Set up horse at Foxhall, and I by water\n297\n(observing the King’s barge attending his going to the House this\nday) home, it being about one a-clock.\nSo got myself ready and shifting myself; and so by water to\nWestminster and there came, most luckily, to the Lords House as\nthe House of Comons were going into the Lords’ House, and there I\ncrowded in along with the Speaker — and got to stand close behind\nhim — where he made his speech to the King (who sat with his\ncrown on and robes, and so all the Lords in their robes, a fine sight);\nwherein he told his Majesty what they have done this parliment,\nand now offered for his Royall consent. The Speakers speech was\nfar from any Oratory, but was as plain (though good matter) as\nanything could be and void of elocution. After the bills passed, the\nKing, sitting in his throne with his speech writ in a paper which he\nheld in his lap and scarce looked off of it, I thought, all the time he\nmade his speech to them — giving them thanks for their subsidys.\nHe desired that nothing of old faults should be remembred, or\nseverity for the same used to any in the country, it being his desire\nto have all forgot as well as forgiven. But however, to use all care in\nsuppressing any tumults, &c.; assuring them that the restless spirits\nof his and their adversarys have great expectations of something to\nbe done this summer. So to Whitehall and by water to the Bridge;\nand so home to bed — weary and well pleased with my Journy in all\nrespects. Only, it cost me about 20s.; but it was for my health and I\nhope will prove so. Only, I do find by my ridingalittle swelling to\narise just by my Anus. Ihad the same the last time Irode, and then it\nfell again; and now it is up again about the bigness of the bagg of\na\nSilkeworme.

Thence with Creede to hire a coach to carry us to Hide\nparke, today there being a general muster of the King’s Guards,\nhorse and foot, yet methought all these gay men are not the soldiers\nthat must do the King’s business, it being such as these that lost the\nold King all he had and were beat by the most ordinary fellows that\ncould be. This day in the Dukes chamber, there being a Roman\nstory in the hangings and upon the standards written these four\nletters, SPQR, Sir G. Carteret came to me to know what the\nmeaning of those four letters were — which ignorance is not to be\nborne in a Privy Counsellor methinks, that a schoolboy should be\nwhipt for not knowing.\n8. Being weary and going to bed late last night, I slept till 7 a-\n292\nclock, it raining mighty hard, and so did every minute of the day\nafter, sadly — that Iknow not what will become of the corn this year,\nwe having had but two fair days these many months.

And then down into\nthe cellar, and up and down with Mr. Turner to see where his vault\nfor turds may be made bigger, or another made him; which I think\nmay well be. And so to my office, where very busy all day setting\nthings in order, my contract books, and preparing things against\nthe next sitting. In the eveningI received letters out of the country;\namong others, from my wife, who methinks writes so coldly that I\nam much troubled at it andI fear shall have much ado to bring her to\nher old good temper. So home to supper and music, which is all the\npleasure Ihave of late given myself or is fit Ishould others, spending\ntoo much time and money. Going in, I stepped to Sir W. Batten and\nthere stayed and talked with him, my Lady being in the country,\nand sent for some lobsters; and Mrs. Turner came in and did bring\nus an Umble-pie hot out of her oven, extraordinary good, and\nafterward some spirits of her making (in which she hath great\njudgment), very good; and so home, merry with this night’s\nrefreshment."

He told me also how loose the Court is,\nnobody looking after business but every man his lust and gain; and\nhow the King is now become besotted upon Mrs. Steward, that he\ngets into corners and will be with her half an hour together, kissing\nher to the observation of all the world; and she now stays by herself\nand expects it, as my Lady Castlemayne did use to do; to whom the\nKing, he says, is still kind, so as now and then he goes to havea chat\nwith her as he believes, but with no such fondness as he used to do.\nBut yet it is thought that this new wench is so subtle, that she lets\nhim not do anything more then is safe to her. But yet his doting is so\ngreat that Pierce tells me it is verily thought, that if the Queen had\ndied, he would have married her. The Duke of Monmouth is to\nhave part of the Cockepitt new built for lodgings for him; and they\nsay to be made Captain of the Guards in the room of my Lord\nGerard. In the evening to the Coffee-house and there sat, till by and\nby, by appointment, Will brought me word that his uncle Blacke-\nburne was ready to speak with me. So I went down to him, and he\nand I to a taverne hard by. Mr. Blackeburne and I fell to talk of\nmany things; wherein I did speak so freely to him in many things\nagreeing with his sense, that he was very open to me in all things.\nFirst, in that of Religion, he makes it great matter of prudence for\nthe King and Council to suffer liberty of conscience. And imputes\nthe loss of Hungary to the Turke from the Emperors denying them\nthis liberty of their religion. He says that many pious Ministers of\nthe word of God — some thousands of them, do now beg their\nbread. And told me how highly the present Clergy carry themselfs\neverywhere, so as that they are hated and laughed at by everybody.\nHe tells me that the King, by name, with all his dignities, is prayed\nfor by them that they call Fanatiques, as heartily and powerfully as\nin any of the other churches that are thought better. And that let the\nKing think what he will, it is them that must help him in the day of\nWarr — for, as they are the most, so generally they are the most\nsubstantiall sort of people, and the soberest. And did desire me to\nobserve it to my Lord Sandwich, among other things, that of all\nthe old army now, you cannot see a man begging about the street.\nBut what? You shall have this Captain turned a shoemaker; the\nlieutenant, a Baker; this, a brewer; that, a haberdasher; this\ncommon soldier, a porter; and every man in his apron and frock,\n319\n1663 g—11 November\n&c., as if they never had done anything else — whereas the\n[Cavaliers] go with their belts and swords, swearing and cursing\nand stealing — running into people’s houses, by force oftentimes, to\ncarry away something. And this is the difference between the\ntemper of one and the other; and concludes (and I think with some\nreason) that the spirits of the old Parliament-soldier[s] are so quiet\nand contented with God’s providences, that the King is safer from\nany evil meant him by them, a thousand times more then from his\nown discontented Cavalier[s]. And then to the public management\nof business: it is done, as he observes, so loosely and so carelessly,\nthat the kingdom can never be happy with it, every man looking\nafter himself and his own lust and luxury; among other things, he\ninstanced in the business of mony; he doth believe that half of what\nthe Parliament gives the King is not so much as gathered.\nFrom thence we begun to talk of the Navy, and perticularly of Sir\nW. Pen—of whose rise to be a general I had a mind to be informed.\nHe told me he was always a conceited man and one that would put\nthe best side outward, but that it was his pretence of sanctity that\nbrought him into play. Lawson and Portman and the Fifth-\nmonarchy men, among whom he wasa\ngreat brother, importuned\nthat he might be general; and it was pleasant to see how Blackburn\nhimself did act it; how when the Comissioners of the Admiralty\nwould enquire of the Captains and Admiralls of such and such men,\nhow they would with a sithe and casting up the eye say, “Such a\nman fears the Lord” — or, “I hope such a man hath the Spirit of\nGod,” and such things as that. But he tells me that there was a cruel\nArticling against Pen after one fight, for cowardice in putting\nhimself within a Coyle of Cables, of which he had much ado to\nacquit himself. Thus far, and upon many more things, we had\ndiscoursed, when some persons in a room hard by begun to sing in\nthree parts very finely, and to play upon a Flagilette so pleasantly,\nthat my discourse afterward was but troublesome andI could not\nattend it; and so anon considering of a sudden the time a-night, we\nfind it 11 a-clock, which I thought it had not been by two hours, but\nwe were close in talk; and so we rise, he having drunk some wine\nand I some beer and sugar, and so by a fair moonshine home and to\nbed. My wife troubled with toothake.\n11. Upand to my office all the morning; and at noon to the\nCoffee-house, where with Dr. Allen some good discourse about\nphysic and Chymistry. And among other things, I telling him what\n320\nDribble the German Doctor do offer, of an Instrument to sink\nships, he tells me that which is more strange: that something made\nof gold, which they call in Chymistry Aurum Fulminans; a grain, |\nthink he said, of it put into a silver spoon and fired, will give a blow\nlike a musquett and strike a hole through the spoon downward,\nwithout the least force upward."

And\nthat being now fearful of a sudden summons to Portsmouth for the\ndischarge of some ships there, Ijudge it very unbecoming the duty\nwhich (every bit of bread I eat tells me) | owe to your Lordshipp to\nexpose the safety of your Honour to the uncertainty of my return.\nFor the matter (my Lord), it is such as could I in any measure think\nsafe to conceal from, or likely to be discovered to you by any other\nhand, I should not have dared so far to own what from my heart I\nbelieve is false, as to make myself but the relater of others discourse.\nBut, Sir, your Lordships honour being such as I ought to value it to\nbe, and finding both in City and Court that discourses pass to your\nprejudice, too generally for mine or any man’s controlling but your\nLordships, I shall (my Lord), without the least greatening or\nlessening the matter, do my duty in laying it shortly before you.\nPeople of all conditions (my Lord) raise matter of wonder from\nyour Lordships so little appearance at Court — some concluding\nthence your disfavour there. To which purpose I have had\nQuestions asked me; and endeavouring to put off such insinuacions\nby asserting the contrary, they have replied that your Lordships\nliving so beneath your Quality, out of the way and declining of\nCourt attendance, hath been more then once discoursed about the\nKing. Others (my Lord), when the chief Ministers of State, and\nthose most active of the Council have been reckoned up (wherein\nyour Lordship never use to want an eminent place), have said,\ntouching your Lordshipp, that now your turn was served and the\nKing had given you a good estate, you left him to stand or fall as he\nwould. And, perticularly in that of the Navy, have enlarged upon\nyour letting fall all service there. Another sort (and those the most)\ninsist upon the bad report of the house wherein your Lordship (now\nobserved in perfect health again) continues to sojourne. And by\nname have charged one of the daughters for a common Courtizan,\nalleging both places and persons where and with whom she hath\nbeen too well known. And how much her wantonness occasions\n(though unjustly) scandal to your Lordship; and that as well to\ngratifying of some enemies as to the wounding of more friends, I\nam not able to tell. Lastly (my Lord), I find a general coldness in all\npersons towards your Lordship; such as, from my first dependence\non you, I never yet knew. WhereinI shall not offer to interpose any\n323\nthoughts or advice of mine, well knowing your Lordship needs not\nany. But, with a most faithful assurance that no person nor papers\nunder Heaven is privy to what Ihere write, besides myself and this,\nwhich I shall be careful to have put into your own hands, I rest\nconfident of your Lordships just construction of my dutiful intents\nherein, and in all humility take leave.\nMay it please your Lordship, Your Lordships most obedient\nservant,\nS:PeNov.-17. 1663:\nMemorandum. The letter beforegoing was sent sealed up, and\nenclosed in this that fallows.\nMy Lord.\nIfthis finds your Lordshipp either not alone or not at leisure, Ibeg\nthe suspending your opening of the enclosed till you shall be both —\n(the matter very well bearing such a delay) and in all humility\nremain.\nMay it please your Lordshipp, Your Lordshipps most obedient\nservant,\nS.P.

I would have made\nexcuses in it; but seeing him so earnest init, Ifound myself forced to\nit; and so did tell him Mr. Pierce the surgeon in that of his low living\nbeing discoursed of at Court — a maid-servant that I kept that lived\nat Chelsy school, and also Mr. Pickering, about the report touching\n325\nthe young woman; and also Mr. Hunt in axe yard, near whom she\nlodged. I told him the whole City doth discourse concerning his\nneglect of business; and so I many times asserting my dutiful\nintention in all this, and he owning his accepting of it as such. That\nthat troubled me most in perticular is that he did there assert the\ncivility of the people of the house and the young gentlewoman, for\nwhose reproach he was sorry. I could not forbear weeping before\nhim at the latter end; which since I am ashamed of, though I cannot\nsee what he can take it to proceed from but my tenderness and good\nwill to him. After this discourse was ended, he begun to talk very\ncheerfully of other things, and I walked with him to Whitehall and\nwe discoursed of the pictures in the gallery; which, it may be, he\nmight do out of policy, that the boy might not see any strangeness\nin him; but I rather think that his mind was somewhat eased, and\nhope that he will be to me as he was before.

This\nmorning was brought home my new velvet cloak; that is, lined\nwith velvet, a good cloth the outside-—the first that ever Ihad in my\nlife, and I pray God it may not be too soon now that I begin to wear\nit. I had it this day brought home, thinking to have worn it to\n314\n29 October 1663\ndinner; but I thought it would be better to go without it because of\nthe Crowde, and so I did not wear it. In dressing myself and\nwanting a band, I found all my bands that were newly made clean,\nso ill-smoothed that I crumpled them and flung them all on the\nground and was angry with Jane, which made the poor girl mighty\nsad, so that I were troubled for it afterwards. At noon! went forth,\nand by coach to Guild Hall (by the way calling to shit at Mr.\nRawlinsons) and there was admitted; and meeting with Mr. Proby\n(Sir R. Ford’s son) and Lieut.- Coll. Baron, a City commander, we\nwent up and down to see the tables; where under every salt there\nwas a Bill of fare, and at the end of the table the persons proper for\nthat table. Many were the tables, but none in the Hall but the\nMayors and the Lords of the privy Councell that had napkins or\nknives — which was very strange. We went into the Buttry and there\nstayed and talked, and then into the hall again; and there wine was\noffered and they drunk, I only drinking some Hypocras, which\ndoth not break my vowe, it being, to the best of my present\njudgment, only a mixed compound drink, and not any wine — if I\nam mistaken, God forgive me; but Ihope and do think I am not. By\nand by met with Creed; and we with the others went within the\nseveral Courts and there saw the tables prepared for the ladies and\nJudges and Bishops — all great sign of a great dinner to come. By and\nby, about one a-clock, before the Lord Mayor came, came into the\nhall, from the room where they were first led into, the Lord\nChancellor (Archbishopp before him), with the Lords of the\nCouncil and other Bishopps, and they to dinner. Anon comes the\nLord Mayor, who went up to the Lords and then to the other tables\nto bid wellcome; and so all to dinner. I set near Proby, Baron, and\nCreed at the Merchant Strangers table — where ten good dishes to a\nmesse, with plenty of wine of all sorts, of which Idrunk none; but it\nwas very unpleasing that we had no napkins nor change of\ntrenchers, and drunk out of earthen pitchers and wooden dishes. It\nhappened that, after the Lords had half dined, came the French\nAmbassador up to the Lords’ table, where he was to have sat; but\nfinding the table set, he would not sit down nor dine with the Lord\nMayor, who was not yet come, nor have a table to himself, which\nwas offered; but in a discontent went away again. After Ihad dined,\nI and Creed rose and went up and down the house, and up to the\nladies room and there stayed gazing upon them. But though there\nwere many and fine, both young and old, yet I could not discern\none handsome face there, which was very strange. I expected\n315\n1663 29 October—1 November\nMusique, but there was none; but only trumpets and drums, which\ndispleased me. The dinner, it seems, is made by the Mayor and two\nSheriffs for the time being, the Lord Mayor paying one half and\nthey the other — and the whole, Proby says, is reckoned to come to\nabout 7 or 800/ at most. Being wearied with looking upon a\ncompany of ugly women, Creed and I went away; and took coach\nand through Cheapside and there saw the pageants, which were\nvery silly. And thence to the Temple; where meeting Greatorex, he\nand we to the Hercules pillers, there to show me the manner of his\ngoing about a great work of drayning of Fenns, which I desired\nmuch to know; but it did not appear very satisfactory to me as he\ndiscoursed it, and I doubt he will fail in it.\n31. Torthe office, where busy till night; and then to prepare my\nmonthly account, about whichI stayed till 10 or 11 a-clock at night;\nand to my great sorrow, find myself 43! worse then I was the last\nmonth; which was then 760! and now is but 717/. But it hath chiefly\narisen from my layings-out in clothes for myself and wife —viz., for\nher, about 12/; and for myself, 55/ or thereabouts — having made\nmyself a velvet cloak, two new cloth-suits, black, plain both — a\nnew shag-gown, trimmed with gold buttons and twist; with a new\nhat, and silk top[s] for my legs, and many other things, being\nresolved henceforward to go like myself. And also two periwigs,\none whereof costs me 3/ and the other gos. I have wore neither yet,\nbut will begin next week, God willing. So that I hope I shall not\nnow need to lay out more money a great while, I having laid out in\nclothes for myself and wife, and for her closet and other things\nwithout, these two months (this and the last), besides household\nexpenses of victuals &c., above rrol. But I hope I shall with more\ncomfort labour to get more, and with better successe then when,\nfor want of clothes, I was forced to sneak like a beggar. Having\ndone this, I went home; and after supper to bed.\n~*NOVEMBER®-\n1. Lords day. This morning my brother’s man brought me a new\nblack bays waistcoat faced with silk, which I put on— from this day\nlaying by half-shirts for this winter. He brought me also my new\ngowne of purple Shagg, trimmed with gold, very handsome. He\n316\nalso brought me, asa gift from my brother, a velvet hat, very fine to\nride in and the fashion, which pleases me very well; to which end I\nbelieve he sent it me, for he knew I had lately been angry with him.\nUp and to church with my wife; and at noon dined at home alone—a\ngood calf’s head boiled and dumplings, an excellent dinner\nmethought it was."

Then I went and sat by Mr. Harrington and\nsome East Country merchants; and talking of the country about\nQuinsborough' and thereabouts — he told us himself that for fish,\nnone there, the poorest body, will buy a dead fish; but must be\nalive, unless it be in winter; and then they told us the manner of\nputting their nets into the water through holes made in the thicke\nIce; they will spread a net of halfa mile long, and he hath known 130\nand 170 barrells of fish taken at one draught. And then the people\ncomes with Sledges upon the Ice, with snow at the Bottome, and\nlay the fish in and cover them with snow, and so carry them to\nmarket. And he hath seen when the said fish have been frozen in the\nsled, so as that he hath takena\nfish and broke a-pieces, so hard it hath\nbeen; and yet the same fishes, taken out of the snow and brought\ninto a hot room, will be alive and leap up and down. Swallow often\nare brought up in their nets out of the mudd from under water,\nhanging together to some twigg or other, dead in ropes; and\nbrought to the fire, will come to life. Fowl killed in December (Ald.\nBarker said) he did buy; and putting into the box under his sled, did\nforget to take them out to eate till Aprill next, and they then were\nfound there and were, through the frost, as sweet and fresh and eat\nas well as at first killed. Young Beares are there; their flesh sold in\nI. K6nigsberg, East Prussia.\n330\nmarket as ordinarily as beef here, and is excellent sweet meat. They\ntell us that Beares there do never hurt anybody, but fly away from\nyou unless you pursue and set upon them — but Wolves do much\nmischief. Mr. Harrington told us how they do to get so much\nhoney as they send abroad. They make hallow agreat Firr tree,\nleaving only a small slitt down straight in one place; and this they\nclose up again, only leavea little hole and there the Bees go in and\nfill the bodies of these trees as full of wax and honey as they can\nhold; and the inhabitants at their times go and open that slit and take\nwhat they please, without killing the bees, and so let them live there\nstill and make more. Firr trees are always planted close together,\nbecause of keeping one another from the violence of the windes;\nand when 2 fellet is made, they leave here and there a grown tree to\npreserve the young ones coming up. The great entertainment and\nsport of the Duke of Corland and the princes thereabouts is\nhunting; which is not with dogs as we, but he appoints such a day\nand summons all the country people as to a Campagnia, and by\nseveral companies gives every one their circuit, and they agree upon\na place where the Toyle is to be set; and so, making fires every\ncompany as they go, they drive all the wild beast — whether bears —\nwolfe, foxes, Swine, and stags and rowes, into the Toyle; and there\nthe great men have their stands in such and such places and shoot at\nwhat they have a mind to, and that is their hunting. They are not\nvery populous there, by reason that people marry women seldom\ntill they are towards or above 30; and men 30 or 40, or more\noftentimes, year old. Against a public hunting, the Duke sends that\nno wolfes be killed by the people; and whatever harm they do, the\nDuke makes it good to the person that suffers it—as Mr. Harrington\ninstanced in a house where he lodged, where a wolfe broke into a\nhog-stye and bit three or four great pieces off of the back of the hog\nbefore the house could come to help it (it crying, and that did give\nnotice to the people of the house); and the man of the house told him\nthat there was three or four wolfs thereabouts that did them great\nhurt; but it was no matter, for the Duke was to make it good to him,\notherwise he could kill them."

And what through my sleeping so long last\nnight and vexation for the lazy sluts lying so long against their great\nwash, neither my wife nor I could sleep one winke after that time till\nday; and then I rose and by coach (taking Capt. Grove with me and\nthree bottles of Tent, which I sent to Mrs. Lane by my promise on\nSaturday night last) to Whitehall and there with the rest of our\ncompany to the Duke and did our business; and thence I to the\nTennis Court till noon and there saw several great matches played;\nand so by invitation to St. James’s, where at Mr. Coventry’s\nchamber I dined with my Lord Barkely, Sir G. Carteret, Sir Edwd.\nTurner, Sir Ellis Layton, and one Mr. Seymour, a fine gentleman;\nwhere admirable good discourse of all sorts, pleasant and serious.\nThence after dinner to Whitehall; where the Duke being busy at the\nGuinny business — the Duke of Albemarle, Sir W. Rider, Povy, Sir\nJ. Lawson and I to the Duke of Albemarle’s lodgings and there did\nsome business; and so to the Court again and I to the Duke of\nYorkes lodgings, where the Guinny Company are choosing their\nAssistants for the next year by balletting. Thence by coach with Sir\nJ. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower; he set me down at Cornhill;\nbut Lord, the simple discourse that all the way we had, he\nmagnifying his great undertakings and cares that have been upon\nhim for these last two years, and how he commanded the City to\nthe content of all parties, when the loggerhead knows nothing\nalmost that is sense. Thence to the Coffee-house, whither comes Sir\nW. Petty and Capt. Grant, and we fell in talk (besides a young\ngentleman I suppose a merchant, his name Mr. Hill, that hath\ntravelled and I perceive is a master in most sorts of Musique and\nother things) of Musique, the Universall Character — art of\nMemory — Granger’s counterfeiting of hands — and other most\nexcellent discourses, to my great content, having not been in so\ngood company a great while. And had I time I should covett the\n342\nacquaintance of that Mr. Hill. This morning I stood by the King,\narguing with a pretty Quaker woman that delivered to him a desire\nof hers in writing. The King showed her SirJ. Minnes, as a man the\nfittest for her quaking religion, saying that his beard was the stiffest\nthing about him. And again merrily said, looking upon the length\nof her paper, that ifall she desired was of that length, she might lose\nher desires. She modestly saying nothing till he begun seriously to\ndiscourse with her, arguing the truth of his spirit against hers. She\nreplying still with these words, ‘“‘O King!”, and thou’d him all\nalong."

But tomorrow my vowes are all out as to plays and wine; but I\nhope I shall not be long before I come to new ones, so much good,\nand God’s blessing, I find to have attended them. Thence to the\noffice and did several businesses and answered several people; but\nmy head akeing and it being my great night of accounts, I went\nforth, took coach, and to my brother’s, but he was not within; and\nso Iback again and sat an hour or two at the Coffee[-house], hearing\n335\n1663 31 December\nsome simple discourse about Quakers being charmed by\nastring\nabout their wrists. And so home; and aftera\nlittle while at my office,\nIhome and supped; and so had a good fire in my chamber and there\nsat till 4 a-clock in the morning, making up my accounts and\nwriting this last Journall of the year.\nAnd first, I bless God I do find that 1am worth in money, besides\nall my household stuff or anything of Brampton, above 80ol — for\nwhich the good God be pleased to give me a thankful heart and a\nmind careful to preserve this and encrease it. I do live at my\nlodgings in the Navy Office — my family being, besides my wife\nand I, Jane Gentleman, Besse our excellent good-natured cook-\nmaid, and Susan,alittle girl — having neither man nor boy, nor like\nto have again a good while — living now in most perfect content and\nquiet and very frugally also. My health pretty good, but only that I\nhave been much troubled with a costivenesse which I am labouring\nto get away, and have hopes of doing it. At the office I am well,\nthough envied to the devil by Sir W. Batten, who hates me to death\nbut cannot hurt me. The rest either love, or at least do not show\notherwise, though I know Sir W. Penn to bea false knave touching\nme, though he seems fair. My father and mother well in the\ncountry; and at this time, the young ladies of Hinchingbrooke with\nthem, their house having the smallpox in it. The Queene, after a\nlong and sore sickness, is become well again. And the King minds\nhis mistress a little too much. But Ihope all things will go well, and\nin the Navy perticularly; wherein I shall do my duty, whatever\ncomes of it. The great talk is the designs of the King of France;\nwhether against the Pope or King of Spain nobody knows; but a\ngreat and a most promising prince he is, and all the princes of\nEurope have their eye upon him. My wife’s brother come to great\nunhappiness by the ill-disposition, my wife says, of his wife, and\nher poverty; which she now professes, after all her husband’s\npretence of\na great portion. But I see none of them; at least, they\ncome not to trouble me. My brother Tom Iknow not what to think\nof, for I cannot hear whether he minds his business or no. And my\nbrother John, at Cambrige with as little hopes of doing good there;\nfor when he was here, he did give me great cause of dissatisfaction\nwith his manner oflife. Pall with my father, and God knows what\nshe doth there or what will become of her, for I have not anything\nyet to spare her, and she grows now old and must be disposed of\none way or other. The Turkes very fur entered into Germany, and\n336\n31 December 1663\nall that part of the world at a loss what to expect from his\nproceedings.\nMyself, blessed be God, in a good way and design and resolution\nby sticking to my business to geta little money, with doing the best\nservice I can to the King also— which God continue. So ends the old\nyear.\n337\nAes\nae\nfp\n—+ JANUARY\n#-\n1. Went to bed between 4 and 5 in the morning with my mind in\ngood temper of satisfaction — and slept till about 8, that many\npeople came to speak with me. And then, being to dine at my uncle\nWights, I went to the Coffee-house (sending my wife by Will) and\nthere stayed talking an hour with Coll. Middleton and others; and\namong other things, about a very rich widow, young and\nhandsome, of one Sir Nich. Golds, a merchant lately fallen, and of\ngreat Courtiers that already look after her. Her husband not dead a\nweek yet. She is reckoned worth 80000/. Thence to my Uncle\nWights, where Dr. [Burnet] among others dined, and his wife a\nseeming proud conceited woman; I know not what to make of her.\nBut the Doctors discourse did please me very well about the disease\nof the Stone; above all things extolling Turpentine, which he told\nme how it may be taken in pills with great ease. There was brought\nto table a hot pie made of swan I sent them yesterday, given me by\nMr. Howe; but we did not eat any of it. But my wife and Irise from\ntable pretending business, and went to the Dukes house, the first\nplay Ihave been at these six months, according to my last vowe; and\nhere saw the so much cried-up play of Henry the &8th— which, though\nI went with resolution to like it, is so simple a thing, made up of a\ngreat many patches, that, besides the shows and processions in it,\nthere is nothing in the world good or well done. Thence, mightily\ndissatisfied, back at night to my uncle Wights and supped with\nthem; but against my stomach out of the offence the sight of my\naunts hands gives me; and ending supper with a mighty laugh (the\ngreatest I have had these many months) at my uncles being out in\nhis grace after meat, we rise and broke up and my wife and I home\nand to bed — being sleepy since last night.\n2. Ido find that I am not able to conquer myself as to going to\nplays till I do come to some new vow concerning it and that Iam\nnow come: that is to say, that I will not see above one in a month at\n338\nany of the public theatres till the sum of 50s. be spent, and then none\nbefore New Year’s Day next, unless that I do become worth roool\nsooner then then — and then I am free to come to some other terms.\nAnd so I took my wife to the King’s house and there met with Mr.\nNicholson my old colleague — and saw The Usurper, which is no\ngood play, though better then what I saw yesterday. However, we\nris unsatisfied and took coach and home. AndIto the office late,\nwriting letters; and so home to supper and to bed."

And out of an\nimpatience to break up with my head full of confused confounded\nnotions but nothing brought to a clear comprehension, I was\nresolved to set up, and did, till now it is ready to strike 4 a-clock, all\nalone, cold, and my candle not enough left to light me to my own\nhouse; and so, with my business however brought to some good\nunderstanding and set it down pretty clear, I went home to bed,\nwith my mind at good quiet and the girle setting up for me (the rest\nall a-bed); I eat and drank a little and to bed, weary, sleepy, cold,\nand my head akeing.\n352\n18-19.

Very full of business till noon, and then with Mr. Coventry\nto the Affrican house and there fell to my Lord Peterborough’s\naccounts; and by and by to dinner, where excellent discourse — Sir\nG.

The King led away by half a dozen men, that none of his\nserious servants and friends can come at him. These are Lodderdale,\nBuckingham, Hamilton, Fitzharding, to whom he hath it seems\ngiven 12000! per annum too, in the best part of the King’s estate\nand that that the old Duke of Buckingham could never get of the\nKing. Projers is another, and Sir H. Bennett. He loves not the\nQueen at all, but is rather sullen to her; and she by all reports\nincapable of children. He is fond of the Duke of Monmouth that\neverybody admires* it; and he says the Duke hath said that he\nwould be the death of any man that says the King was not married\nto her! — though Alsopp says it is well known that she was a\ncommon whore when the King lay with her. But it seems, he says,\nthat the King is mighty kind to these his bastard children and at this\nday will go at midnight to my Lady Castlemaynes nurses and take\n1. Monmouth’s mother, Lucy Walter.\n353\n1664 22 February\nthe child and dance it in his arms. That he is not likely to have his\ntables up again in his house,' for the crew that are about him will\nnot have him come to common view again, but keep him obscurely\namong themselfs. He hath this night, it seems, ordered that the hall\n(which there is a ball to be in tonight before the King) be guarded, as\nthe Queen-mother’s is, by his Horse Guards; whereas heretofore\nthey were by the Lord Chamberlin or Steward and their people.\nBut it is feared they will reduce all to the soldiery, and all other\nplaces taken away. And which is worst of all, that he will alter the\npresent militia and bring all to a flying army. That my Lord\nLodderdale, being middleton’s enemy and one that scores the\nChancellor, even to open affronts before the King, hath got the\nwhole power of Scottland into his hand; whereas the other day he\nwas in a fair way to have had his whole estate and honour and life\nvoted away from him. That all the Court are mad for a Dutch war;\nbut both he and I did concur that it was a thing rather to be dreaded\nthen hoped for—unless, by the French King’s falling upon Flanders,\nthey and the Dutch should be divided. That the talk which these\npeople about our King that I named before have, is to tell him how\nneither privileges of Parliament nor City is anything; but his will is\nall and ought to be so; and their discourse, it seems, when they are\nalone, is so base and sordid that it makes the eares of the very\ngentlemen of back-staires, I think he called them, to tingle to hear it\nspoke in the King’s hearing — and that must be very bad endeed.\nThat my Lord Digby did send to Lisbon a couple of priests to search\nout what they could against the Chancellor concerning the match,\nas to the point of his knowing beforehand that she was not capable\nof bearing children’ and that something was given her to make her\nso. Ireland in a very distracted condition about the hard usage\nwhich the protestants meet with, and the too good which the\ncatholiques. And from all together, God knows my heart, I expect\nnothing but ruin can fallow, unless things are better ordered in a\nlittle time.\nHe being gone, my wife came and told me how kind my uncle\nWight hath been to her today also; and that though she sees that all\nhis kindness to us comes from respect to her, she discovers nothing\nbut great civility from him; yet by what she says, he otherwise will\nI. sc. will not dine in public in the palace.\n2. Clarendon was said to have planned the King’s marriage to a barren Princess in\nthe dynastic interest of his daughter, the Duchess of York.\n354\ntell me. But today he told her plainly that had she a child it should be\nhis heire; and that should Ior she want, he would be a good friend to\nus, and did give my wife instructions to consent to all his wife says\nat any time, she being a pettish woman; which argues a design he\nhath I think of keeping us in with his wife, in order to our good,\nsure — and he declaring her jealousy of him, that so he dares not\ncome to see my wife as otherwise he would do and will endeavour\nto do. It looks strange, putting all together; but yet I am in hopes he\nmeans well. After all this discourse with my wife at my office alone,\nshe home to see how the wash goes on and I to make an end of my\nwork; and so home to supper and to bed."

We,\n356\nupon consultation, had stopped at the Cocke, a mile a-this-side\nBarnett, being unwilling to put ourselfs to the charge or doubtful\nacceptance of any provision against my Lord’s coming by, and\nthere got something and dined, setting a boy to look towards\nBarnett hill against their coming. And after two or three false\nalarms they came, and we met the coach very gracefully, andI hada\nkind receipt from both Lord and Lady as I could wish and some\nkind discourse; and then rode by the coach a good way and so fell to\ndiscoursing with several of the people there, being a dozen\nattending the coach and another coach for the maids and parson.\nAmong others, talking with W.

Up and walked to Pauls; and by chance it was an\nextraordinary day for the Readers of the Inns of Court and all the\nstudents to come to church, it being an old ceremony not used these\n25 years — upon the first Sunday in Lent. Abundance there was of\nstudents, more then there was room to seat but upon forms, and the\nChurch mighty full. One Hawkins preached, an Oxford man —a\ngood sermon upon these words: “But the wisdom from above is\nfirst pure, then peaceable.’’ Both before and after sermon I was\nmost impatiently troubled at the Quire, the worst that ever I heard.\nBut what was extraordinary, the Bishop of London, who sat there\nin a pew made a-purpose for him by the pulpitt, doth give the last\nblessing to the congregation — which was, he being a comely old\nman, a very decent thing methought. The Lieutenant of the Tower,\nSir\nJ.Robinson, would needs have me by coach home with him;\nand sending word home to my house, I did go and dine with him,\nhis ordinary table being very good — and his Lady a very high-\ncarriaged but comely big woman; I was mightily pleased with her.\nHis officers of his Regiment dined with him. No discourse at table\nto any purpose. Only, after dinner my Lady would needs see a boy\nwhich was represented to her to be an innocent country boy,\nbrought up to town a day or two ago and left here to the wide\nworld, and he losing his way, fell into the Tower; and which my\nLady believes and takes pity of him and will keep him; but though a\nlittle boy and but young, yet he tells his tale so readily and answers\nall Que[s]tions so wittily, that for certain he is an arch rogue and\nbred in this town. But my Lady will not believe it, but ordered\nvictuals to be given him — and I think will keep him as a footboy for\ntheir eldest son. After dinner to Chappell in the Tower with the\nLieutenant, with the Keyes carried before us and the Warders and\ngentleman Porter going before us. AndI sat with the Lieutenant in\nhis pew in great state, but slept all the sermon. None, it seems, of\nthe prisoners in the Tower that are there now, though they may,\n358\nwill come to prayers there. Church being done, I back to Sir Johns\nhouse, and there left him and home; and by and by to Sir Wm. Pen\nand stayed a while talking with him about Sir\nJ.Mennes his folly in\nhis office, of which I am sick and weary to speak of it; and how the\nKing is abused in it — though Pen, I know, offers the discourse only\nlike a rogue to get it out of me; but Iam very free to tell my mind to\nhim in the case, being not unwilling he should tell him again if he\nwill, or anybody else. Thence home and walked in the garden by\nbrave Mooneshine with my wife above two hours, till past 8\na’-clock; then to supper, and after prayers to bed."

But tells me that he\nhath been a very bad husband as to spending his time, and hath\noften told him of it. So that upon the whole, I do find he is, whether\nhe lives or dies, a ruined man.

And what with that and what he owes my\nfather and me, I doubt he is in a very sad condition; that if he lives,\nhe will not be able to show his head — which will be a very great\nshame to me.\n15-16. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning; and at\nnoon comes Madam Turner and her daughter The[oph]. — her chief\nerrand to tell me that she had got Dr. Wiverly her Doctor to search\nmy brother’s mouth, where Mr. Powell says there is an Ulcer; from\nwhence he concludes that he hath had the pox. But the Doctor\nswears there is not, nor ever was any. And my brother being very\nsensible, which Iwas glad to hear, he did talk with him about it; and\nhe did wholly disclaim that ever he had that disease or that ever he\nsaid to Powell that he had it — all which did put me into great\n364\ncomfort as to that reproach which was spread against him. So! sent\nfor a barrel of oysters and they dined, and we were very merry, I\nbeing willing to be so upon this news. After dinner we took coach\nand to my brother’s; where, contrary to my expectation, he\ncontinues as bad or worse, talking idle and now not at all knowing\nany of us as before. Here we stayed a great while, I going up and\ndown the house looking after things. In the evening Dr. Wiverley\ncame again andI sent for Mr. Powell (the Doctor and I having first\nby ourselfs searched my brother again at his privities,; where he was\nas clear as ever he was born, and in the Doctor’s opinion had been\never so). And we three alone discoursed that business, where the\nCoxcomb did give us his simple reasons for what he had said; which\nthe Doctor fully confuted and left the fellow, only saying that he\nshould cease to report any such thing and that what he had said was\nthe best of his judgment, from my brother’s words and ulcer, as he\nsupposed, in his mouth. I threatened him that I would have\nsatisfaction if I heard any more such discourse. And so good night\nto them two, giving the Doctor a piece for his fee but the other\nnothing.\nI to my brother again, where Madam Turner and her company,\nand Mrs. Croxton, my wife, and Mrs. Holding. About 8 a-clock\nmy brother begun to fetch his spittle with more pain and to speak as\nmuch, but not so distinctly; till at last, the phlegm getting the\nmaistery of him and he beginning as we thought to rattle, I had no\nmind to see him die, as we thought he presently would, and so\nwithdrew and led Mrs. Turner home. But before I came back,\nwhich was in a quarter of an hour, my brother was dead. I went up\nand found the nurse holding his eyes shut; and he, poor wretch,\nlying with his chops fallen, a most sad sight and that which put me\ninto a present very great transport of grief and cries. And endeed, it\nwas a most sad sight to see the poor wretch lie now still and dead\nand pale like a stone. I stayed till he was almost cold, while Mrs.\nCroxton, Holden, and the rest did strip and lay him out — they\nobserving his corps, as they told me afterwards, to be as clear as any\nthey ever saw. And so this was the end of my poor brother,\ncontinuing talking idle and his lips working even to his last, that his\nphlegm hindered his breathing; and at last his breath broke out,\nbringing a flood of phlegm and stuff out with it, and so he died.\nThis evening he talked among other talk a great deal of French, very\nplain and good; as among others — “‘quand un homme boit quand il n’a\npoynt d’inclinaciona boire il ne Iuyfaitjamais de bien.” 1 once begun to\n365\ntell him something of his condition and asked him whither he\nthought he should go. He in distracted manner answered me —\n“Why, whither should I go? there are but two ways. If I go to the\nbad way, I must give God thanks for it. And if] go the other way, I\nmust give God the more thanks for it; and Ihope I have not been so\nundutiful and unthankful in my life but I hope I shall go that way.”\nThis was all the sense, good or bad, I could get of him this day.\nI left my wife to see him laid out, and I by coach home, carrying\nmy brother’s papers, all I could find, with me. And having wrote a\nletter to my father, telling him what hath been said, I returned by\ncoach, it being very late and dark, to my brother’s. But all being\ngone, the Corps laid out and my wife at Mrs. Turners, Ithither; and\nthere, after an hour’s talk, we up to bed — my wife andIin the little\nblue chamber. And Ilay close to my wife, being full of disorder and\ngrief for my brother, that I could not sleep nor wake with\nsatisfaction; at last I slept till 5 or 6 a-clock. And then I rose and up,\nleaving my wife in bed, and to my brother’s, where I set them on\ncleaning the house. And my wife coming anon to look after things,\nI up and down to my Cosen Stradwickes and uncle Fenners about\ndiscoursing for the funeral, which Iam resolved to put off till Friday\nnext. Thence home and trimmed myself; and then to the Change\nand told my uncle Wight of my brother’s death; and so by coach to\nmy Cosen Turners and there dined very well. But my wife having\nthose upon her today and in great pain, we were forced to rise in\nsome disorder and in Mrs. Turners coach carried her home and put\nher to bed. Then back again with my Cosen Norton to Mrs.\nTurners and there stayed a while talking with Dr. Pepys, that\npuppy, whom I had no patience to hear. So I left them, and to my\nbrother’s to look after things — and saw the Coffin brought; and by\nand by Mrs. Holden came and saw him nailed up. Then came W.\nJoyce to me half-drunk, and much ado I had to tell him the story of\nmy brother’s being found clear of what was said, but he would\ninterrupt me by some idle discourse or other, of his crying what a\ngood man and a good speaker my brother was and God knows\nwhat. At last, weary of him, I got him away andI to Mrs. Turner’s;\nand there, though my heart is still heavy to think of my poor\nbrother, yet I could give way to my fancy to hear Mrs. The[oph].\nplay upon the Harpsicon — though the Musique did not please me\nneither. Thence to my brother’s and found them with my maid\nElizabeth, taking an Inventory of the goods of the house; which |\nwas well pleased at, and am much beholding to Mr. Honywoods\n366\nman in doing of it. His name is Herbert, one that says he knew me\nwhen he lived with Sir Samuel Morland — but Ihave forgot him. So\nI left them at it and by coach home and to my office, there to do a\nlittle business; but God knows, my heart and head is so full of my\nbrother’s death and the consequences of it, that I can do very little or\nunderstand it. So home to supper; and after looking over some\nbusiness in my chamber, to bed to my wife, who continues in bed in\nsome pain still. This day I have a great barrel of Oysters given me\nby Mr. Barrow, as big as 16 of others, and Itook it in the coach with\nme to Mrs. Turner’s and gave them her. This day the Parliament\nmet again after a long prorogation — but what they have done Ihave\nnot been in the way to hear."

By and by, it beginning to\nbe late, I put things in some order in the house and so took my wife\nand Besse (who hath done me very good service in cleaning and\ngetting ready everything and serving the wine and things today,\nand is endeed a most excellent good-natured and faithful wench and\nI love her mightily) by coach home; and so after being at the office\nto set down this day’s work, home to supper and to bed."

He showed me endeed many excellent collections of\nthe state of the Revenue in former Kings and the late times and the\npresent. He showed me how the very Assessements between 1643\nand 1659, which was taxes (besides Excize, Customes, Sequestra-\ncions, Decimacions, King and Queenes and Church lands, or\nanything else but just the assessements) come to above 15 Millions.\nHe showed me a discourse of his concerning the Revenues of this\nand foreign States. How that of Spayne was great, but divided with\nhis kingdoms and so came to little. How that of France did and doth\nmuch exceed ours before for quantity; and that it is at the will of the\nPrince to tax what he will upon his people; which is not here. That\nthe Hollanders have the best manner of tax, which is only upon the\nexpense of provisions, by an excize; and doth conclude that no\nother tax is proper for England but a pound rate or excize upon the\nexpense of provisions. He showed me every perticular sort of\npayment away of money since the King’s coming in to this day; and\ntold me, from one to one, how little he hath receivedof profit from\nmost of them, and I believe him truly. That the 1200000! which the\nparliament with so much ado did first vote to give the King, and\nsince hath been re-examined by several committees of the present\nparliament, is yet above 300000! short of making up really to the\nKing the 1200000! — as by perticulars he showed me. And in my\nLord Treasurer’s excellent letter to the King upon this subject, he\n359\n1664 29 February—2 March\ntells the King how it was the spending more then the revenue that\ndid give the first occasion of his father’s ruine, and did since to\nthe Rebells; who he says, just like Henry the 8, had great and\nsudden encrease of wealth, but yet by over-spending both died\npoor. And further tells the King how much of this 1200000!\ndepends upon the life of the Prince and so must be renewed by\nparliament again to his Successor; which is seldom done without\nparting with some of the prerogatives of the Crown; or, if denied\nand he persists to take it of the people, it gives occasion to a Civill\nwar, which may, as it did in the late business of Tonnage and\nPoundage, prove fatal to the Crowne. He showed me how many\nways the Lord Treasurer did take before he moved the King to\nFarme the Customes in the manner he doth, and the reasons that\nmoved him to do it. He showed me a very excellent argument to\nprove that our Importing lesse then we export doth not impover-\nish the kingdom, according to the received opinion — which\nthough it be a paradox and that I do not remember the argument,\nyet methought there was a great deal in what he said; and upon\nthe whole, I find him a most exact and methodicall man and of\ngreat industry. And very glad that he thought fit to show me all\nthis, though I cannot easily guess the reason why he should do it\nto me — unless from the plainness that he sees I use to him in\ntelling him how much the King may suffer for our want of\nunderstanding the case of our Treasury.\n-*#MARCH%-\n2.

He complains how most of the Lords of the Council do look\nafter themselfs and their own ends and none the public, unless Sir\nEdw. Nicholas. Sir G. Carteret is diligent, but all for his own ends\nand profit. My Lord Privy Seale, a destroyer of everybody’s\nbusiness and doth no good at all to the public. The Archbishop of\n360\nCanterbury speaks very little nor doth much, being now come to\nthe highest pitch that he can expect. He tells me he believes that\nthings will go very high against the Chancellor by Digby, and that\nbad things will be proved. Talks much of his neglecting the King\nand making the King to trot every day to him, when he is well\nenough to go to visit his Cosen, Chief Justice Hide, but not to the\nCouncil or King. He commends my Lord of Ormond mightily in\nIreland; but cries out cruelly of Sir G. Lane for his corruption and\nthat he hath done my Lord great dishonour by selling of places here,\nwhich are now all taken away and the poor wretches ready to\nstarve. That nobody almost understands or judges of business\nbetter then the King, if he would not be guilty of his father’s fault,\nto be doubtful of himself and easily be removed from his own\nopinion. That my Lord Lauderdale is never from the King’s eare\nnor counsel and that he is a most cunning fellow.

He tells me also\nthat the most he expects is that upon the merchants’ complaints, the\nparliament will represent them to the King, desiring his securing of\nhis subjects against them. And though perhaps they may not\ndirectly see fit, yet even this will be enough to let the Dutch know\nthat the Parliament do not oppose the King; and by that means take\naway their hopes, which was that the King of England could not get\nmoney or do anything towards a war with them. He tells me also\nthat the Dutch States are in no good order themselfs, differing one\nwith another. And that for certain none but the States of Holland\n1. Ambassador to the United Provinces.\no7a\nand Zealand will contribute towards a war, the other reckoning\nthemselfs, being inland, not concerned in the profits of war or\npeace. But it is pretty to see what he says. That those here that are\nforward for a war at Court, they are reported in the world to be\nonly designers of getting money into the King’s hands. They that\nelsewhere are for it have a design to trouble the kingdom and to give\nthe fanatics an opportunity of doing hurt. And lastly, those that are\nagainst it (as he himself for one is very cold therein) are said to be\nbribed by the Dutch."

And\nseems but this day, after much discourse of mine, to be sensible of\nthat part of his folly, besides a great deal more in other things. That\nbeing done — Sir\nJ.Mennes andI sat all the morning; and then I to\nthe Change and there got a way, by pretence of business with my\nUncle Wight, to put off Creed, whom I had invited to dinner; and\nso home and there find Madam Turner, her Daughter The[oph].,\nJoyce Norton, my father and Mr. Honywood, and by and by\ncomes my uncle Wight and aunt — this being my solemn feast for\nmy cutting of the stone, it being now, blessed be God, this day six\nyeares since that time. And I bless God I do in all respects find\nmyself free from that disease or any signs of it, more then that upon\nthe least cold I continue to have pain in making water, by gathering\nof wind and growing costive — till which be removed I am at no\nease; but without that, I am very well. Dinner not being presently\nready, I spent some time myself and showed them a map of Tanger,\nleft this morning at my house by Creed, cut by our order, the\nComissioners, new drawn by Jonas Moore -— which is very pleasant\nand I purpose to have it finely set out and hung up. After dinner Sir\nW. Batten sent to speak with me and told me that he had proffered\nour bill! today in the House; and that it was read without any\ndissenters and he fears not but will pass very well — whichI shall be\nglad of. He tells me also how, upon occasion of some prentices\nbeing put in the pillory today for beating of their master, or some\nsuchlike thing, in Cheapeside — a company of prentices came and\nrescued them and pulled down the Pillory; and they being set up\nagain, did the like again. So that the Lord Mayor and Maj.-Gen.\nBrowne was fain to come and stay there to keep the peace; and\ndrums all up and down the City was beat to raise the train-bands for\nto quiet the town. And by and by going out with my Uncle and\nAunt Wight by coach with my wife through Cheapside (the rest of\nthe company, after much content and mirth, being broke up), we\nsaw a trained-band stand in Cheapside upon their guard. We went\n1. Empowering the officers of the Navy Board to act as magistrates in the City.\n371\n1664 26 March-1 April\nmuch against my uncles will as far almost as Hyde park, he and my\naunt falling out all the way about it, which vexed me. But all was\npeace again presently. And so it raining very fast, we met many\nbrave coaches coming from the park, and so we turned and set them\ndown at home; and so home ourselfs and ended the day with great\ncontent — to think how it hath pleased the Lord in six years time to\nraise me from a condition of constant and dangerous and most\npainful sickness and low condition and poverty to a state of constant\nhealth almost — great honour and plenty, for which the Lord God of\nHeaven make me truly thankful. My wife found her gown come\nhome laced; which is indeed very handsome but will cost mea great\ndeal of money, more than ever I intended — but it is but for once. So\nto the office and did business; and then home and to bed.\n31.

Up and to my office, where busy till noon; and then to the\nChange — where I find all the merchants concerned with the\npresenting their complaints to the committee of Parliament\nappointed to receive them this afternoon against the Dutch. So\nhome to dinner and thence by coach, setting my wife down at the\nNew Exchange; I to Whitehall and coming too soon for the Tanger\nCommittee, walked to Mr. Blagrave for a song Ileft long ago there.\nBack to Whitehall and in the Gallery met the Duke of Yorke (Ialso\nsaw the Queene going to the parke and her maids of honour; she\nherself look ill, and methinks Mrs. Stewart is grown fatter and not\nso fair as she was) and he called me to him and discourse a good\nwhile with me; and after he was gone twice or thrice, stayed and\ncalled me again to him the whole length of the Howse. And at last\ntalked of the Dutch; and I perceive doth much wish that the\nParliament will find reason to fall out with them. He gone, Iby and\nby find that the Comissioners of Tanger met at the Duke of\nAlbemarles, and so I have lost my labour. So with Creed to the\nChange and there took up my wife and left him, and we two home,\n372\nand I to walk in the garden with W. Howe, whom we took up, he\nhaving been to see us. He tells me how Creede hath been questioned\nbefore the Council about a letter that hath been met with, wherein\nhe is mentioned by some fanatiques as a serviceable friend to them;\nbut he says he acquitted himself well in it. But however, something\nsticks against him, he says, with my Lord; at which I am not very\nsorry, for I believe he is a false fellow. I walked with him to Pauls,\nhe telling me how my Lord is little at home — minds his carding and\nlittle else — takes little notice of anybody; but that he doth not think\nthat he is displeased, as I fear, with me; but is strange to all — which\nmakes me the less troubled. So walked back home, and late at the\noffice; so home and to bed. This day Mr. Turner did lend me, as a\nrarity, a manuscript of one Mr. Wells, writ long ago, teaching the\nmethod of building a ship; which pleases me mightily. I was at it\ntonight but durst not stay long at it, I being come to have a great\npain and water in my eyes after candlelight."

He spoke this with very great respect as to my\nLord, though methinks it is strange they should not understand one\nanother better at this time then to need another’s mediacion.\nThence walked over the park to Whitehall, Mr. Povy with me, and\nwas taken in a very great showre in the middle of the park, that we\nwere very wet. So up into the House and with him to the King’s\ncloset, whither by and by the King came, my Lord Sandwich\ncarrying the sword. A Bishop preached; but he speaking too low\nfor me to hear behind the King’s closet, I went forth and walked and\ndiscoursed with Coll. Reames, who seems a very willing man to be\ninformed in his business of Canvas, which he is undertaking to\nstrike in with us to serve the Navy. By and by my Lord Sandwich\ncame forth and called me to him; and we fell into discourse a great\nwhile about his business, wherein he seems to be very open with me\nand to receive my opinion as he used to do; and I hopeI shall\nbecome necessary to him again. He desired me to think of the\nfitness or not for him to offer himself to go to sea, and to give him\nmy thoughts in a day or two. Thence, after sermon, among the\nladies on the Queenes side; where I saw Mrs. Stuart, very fine and\npretty but far beneath my Lady Castlemaine. Thence with Mr.\nPovy home to dinner, where extraordinary cheer. And after dinner,\nup and down to see his house. And in a word, methinks for his\nperspective upon his wall in his garden and the springs rising up —\nwith the perspective in the little closet — his room floored above\nwith woods of several colours, like, but above the best Cabinet\nwork Iever saw —his grotto and vault, with his bottles of wine and a\nwell therein to keep them cool — his furniture of all sorts — his bath at\nthe top of his house — good pictures and his manner of eating and\ndrinking, doth surpass all that ever I did see of one man in all my\nlife."

I see Ihave lost\nhim for ever, but I value it not; for he is a coxcomb and I doubt not\nover-honest by some things which I see. And yet for all his folly, he\nhath the good luck now and then to speak his follies in so good\nwords and with as good a show as if it were reason and to the\npurpose — which is really one of the wonders of my life. In the\nevening to my Uncle Wight’s; and not finding them come home,\nthey being gone to the parke and the Mullbury garden, Iwent to the\nChange, and there meeting with Mr. Hempson, whom Sir W.\n382\nBatten hath lately turned out of his place, merely because of his\ncoming to me when he came to town before he went to him. And\nthere he told me many rogueries of Sir W. Batten. How he knows\nand is able to prove that Capt. Cox of Chatham did give him tol in\ngold to get him to certify for him at the King’s coming in. And that\nTom Newborne did make poor men give him 3/ to get Sir W.\nBatten to cause them to be entered in the yard; and that Sir W.\nBatten hath oftentimes said — “By God, Tom, you shall get\nsomething and I will have some on’t.” His present Clerke that is\ncome in Norman’s room hath given him something for his place.\nThat they live high and (as Sir Frances Clerkes Lady told his wife)\ndo lack money as well as other people, and have bribes of a piece of\nSattin and cabinetts and other things from people that deal with\nhim; and that hardly anybody goes to sea or hath anything done by\nSir W. Batten but it comes with a bribe; and that this is publicly true\n— that his wife was a whore and that he had Libells flung within his\ndoors for a cuckold as soon as he was married. That he received rool\nin money and in other things, to the value of 50 more of Hempson\nand that he entends to give him back but sol. That he hath abused\nthe Chest and hath now some 1000! by himofit."

For the latter, he brought as an instance General Blacke,\nwho in the defending of Taunton and Lime for the Parliament did\nthrough his stubborn sortof valour defend it the most opiniastrement\nthat ever any man did anything — and yet never was the man that\never made any attaque by land or sea, but rather avoyded it on all,\neven fair occasions. On the other side, Prince Rupert the boldest\nattaquer in the world for personal courage; and yet in the defending\nof Bristoll, no man did ever anything worse, he wanting the\n391\npatience and seasoned head to consult and advise for defence and to\nbear with the evils of a Siege.

And yet no man upon a defence — he being all fury and no\njudgment ina fight. He tells me above all of the Duke of Yorke, that\nhe is more himself, and more of judgment is at hand in him, in the\nmiddle of a desperate service then at other times — as appeared in the\nbusiness of Dunkirke, wherein no man ever did braver things or\nwas in hotter service in the close of that day, being surrounded with\nenemies; and then, contrary to the advice of all about him, his\ncounsel carried himself and the rest through them safe\n— by advising\nthat he might make his passage with but a dozen with him; “‘For,”’\nsays he, “the enemy cannot move after me so fast with a great body,\nand with a small one we shall be enough to deal with them.” And\nthough he is a man naturally Martiall to the highest degree, yet a\nman that never in his life talks one word of himself or service of his\nown; but only that he saw such or sucha thing, and lays it down for\na maxime that a Hector can have no courage. He told me also, as a\ngreat instance of some men, that the Prince of Conde’s excellence is\nthat there not being a more furious man in the world, danger in\nfight never disturbs him, more then just to make him Civill and to\ncommand in words of great obligation to his officers and men but\nwithout any the least disturbance in his judgment or spirit."

Being up, Mr. Hollyard came to me; and to my great\nsorrow, after his great assuring me that I could not possibly have\n389\nthe stone again, he tells me that he doth verily fear that I have it\nagain and hath brought me something to dissolve it — which doth\nmake me very much troubled and pray to God to ease me. He gone,\nI down by water to Woolwich and Deptford to look after the\ndespatch of the ships, all the way reading Mr. Spencers book of\nProdigys, which is most ingeniously writ, both for matter and\nstyle. Home at noon and my little girl got me my dinner; and I\npresently out by water and landed at Somerset stairs and thence\nthrough Coventgarden, where I met with Mr. Southwell (Sir W.\nPen’s friend), who tells me the very sad newes of my Lord Tiviott’s\nand 19 more commission officers being killed at Tanger by the\nMoores, by an ambush of the enemy’s upon them while they were\nsurveying their lines; which is very sad, and he says afflicts the King\nmuch. Thence to W.

Before the play was done, it fell such a storm of Hayle that\nwe in the middle of the pit' were fain to rise, and all the house in a\ndisorder; and so my wife and I out and got intoa\nlittle alehouse and\nstayed there an hour after the play was done before we could get a\ncoach; which at last we did (and by chance took up Joyce Norton\nand Mrs. Bowles and set them at home); and so home ourselfs and I\na little to my office and so home to supper and to bed."

He\nbegun to tell me that he had now pitched upon his day of going to\nsea, upon Monday next; and that he would now give me an account\nhow matters are with him. He told me that his work now in the\nworld is only to keep up his interest at Court, having little hopes to\nget more considerably; he saying that he hath now about 8000! per\nannum. It is true, he says, he oweth about 10000/. But he hath been\nat great charges in getting things to this pass in his estate — besides\nhis building and goods that he hath bought. He says he hath now\nevened his reckonings at the Wardrobe till Michaelmas last, and\nhopes to finish it to Lady-day before he goes. He says, now there is\ndue too, 7000! to him there, if he knew how to get it paid. He says\nhe is as great with the Chancellor, or greater, then ever in his life.\n404.\n15 July 1664\nThat with the King he is the like; and told me an instance, that\nwhereas he formerly was of the private council to the King before\nhe was last sick, and that by that sickness an interruption was made\nin his attendance upon him, the King did not constantly call him, as\nhe used to do, to his private council, only in businesses of the sea\nand the like; but of late, the King did send a message to him by Sir\nHary Bennet, to excuse the King to my Lord that he had not of late\nsent for him as he used to do to his private council, for it was not out\nof any distaste, but to avoid giving offence to some others, whom\nhe did not name but my Lord supposes it might be Prince Rupert,\nor it may be only that the King would rather pass it by an excuse\nthen be thought unkind. But that now he did desire him to attend\nhim constantly; which he hath of late done, and the King never\nmore kind to him in his life then now. The Duke of Yorke, as much\nas is possible; and in the business of late, when I was to speak to my\nLord about his going to sea, he says that he finds the Duke did it\nwith the greatest ingenuity and love in the world; and hath caused in\nhis commission that he be made Admirall of this and what other\nships or fleets shall hereafter be put out after these — which is very\nnoble. He tells me, in these cases and all others, he finds that bearing\nof them patiently is his best way, without noise or trouble; and\nthings wear out of themselfs and come fair again. “But,” says he,\n“take it from me never to trust too much to any man in the world,\nfor you put yourself into his power; and the best-seeming friend\nand real friend as to the present may have or take occasion to fall out\nwith you; and then out comes all. This,” says he, “‘is the whole\ncondition of my estate and interest; whichI tell you because I know\nnot whether I shall see you again or no.”” Then as to the voyage, he\nthinks it will be of charge to him, and no profit; but that he must not\nnow look after nor think to encrease, but study to make good what\nhe hath, that what is due to him from the Wardrobe or elsewhere\nmay be paid; which otherwise would fail, and all a man hath be but\nsmall content to him. So we seemed to take leave one of another;\nmy Lord of me, desiring me that I would write to him and give him\ninformation upon all occasions in matters that concern him —\nwhich, put together with what he preambled with yesterday,\nmakes me think that my Lord doth truly esteem me still, and desires\nto preserve my service to him — which I do bless God for. In the\nmiddle of our discourse my Lady Crew came in to bring my Lord\nWord that he hath another son, my Lady being brought to bed just\nnow. I did not think her time had been so nigh; but she is well\n405\nbrought to bed, for which God be praised — and send my Lord to\nstudy the laying up of something the more."

We had a pretty good dinner — very merry in discourse. Sat\nafter dinner an hour or two. Then down by water to Deptford and\nWoolwich about getting of some business done, which Iwas bound\nto by my oath this month. Walked back from Woolwich to\nGreenwich all alone, save a man that had a cudgell in his hand; and\nthough he told me he laboured in the King’s yards and many other\ngood arguments that he is an honest man, yet God forgive me, I did\ndoubt he might knock me on the head behind with his club — but I\ngot safe home. Then to the making-up my month’s accounts; and\nfind myself still a gainer and rose to 951/, for which God be blessed.\nI end the month with my mind full of business and some sorrow\nthat I have not exactly performed all my vowes, though my not\n1. As a consequence ofthe expulsions which followed the Act of Uniformity: see\nabove, p. 219 & n.\n399\n1664 30 June—2 July\ndoing is not my fault and shall be made good out of my first leisure.\nGreat doubts yet whether the Dutch war go on or no. The fleet\nready in the Hope, of twelve sail — the King and Queenes go on\nboard, they say, on Saturday next. Young children of my Lord\nSandwich gone with their maids from my mother’s; which troubles\nme, it being, Ihear from Mr. Sheply, with great discontent — saying\nthat though they buy good meate, yet can never have it before it\nstinks — which I am ashamed of.\n~¢JULY%-\n1.

By and by comes Dr. Burnett — who assures me\nthat I have an Ulcer either in the Kidnys or Blather; for my water,\nwhich he saw yesterday, he is sure the Sediment is not slime\ngathered by heat, but is a direct pusse. He did write me down some\ndirection what to do for it — but not with the satisfaction I expected.\nI did give him a piece; with good hopes, however, that his advice\nwill be of use to me — though it is strange Mr. Hollyard should\nnever say one word of this ulcer in all his life to me. He being gone, I\nto the Change and thence home to dinner; and so to my office, busy\ntill the evening; and then by agreement came Mr. Hill and Andrew\nand one Cheswicke, a maister who plays very well upon the\nSpinette, and we sat singing Psalms till 9 at night, and so broke up\nwith great pleasure; and very good company it is, and I hopeI shall\nnow and then have their company. They being gone, I to my office\ntill toward 12 a-clock, and then home and to bed. Upon the Change\nthis day Isaw how uncertain the Temper of the people is — that from\nour discharging of about 200 that lay idle, having nothing to do\nupon some of our ships which were ordered to be fitted for service\nand their works are now done — the town doth talk that the King\ndischarges all his men, 200 yesterday and 800 today, and that now\nhe hath got 100000! in his hand, he values not a Dutch warr. But I\nundeceived a great many, telling them how it is.\n\\\n2. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the\nChange; and there (which is strange) I could meet with nobody that\nI could invite home to my venison pasty, but only Mr. Alsop and\n400\nMr. Lanyon, whom I invited last night, and a friend they brought\nalong with them. So home; and with our venison pasty we had\nother good meat and good discourse. After dinner sat close to\ndiscourse about our business of the victualling of the garrison of\nTanger — taking their prices of all provisions; and I do hope to\norder it so that they, and I also, may get something by it — which\ndoth much please me, for I hope I may get nobly and honestly,\nwith profit to the King. They being gone, came Sir W. Warren\nand he and I discoursed long about the business of masts; and then\nin the evening to the office, where late writing letters, and then\nhome to look over some Brampton papers, which I am under an\noath to despatch before I spend one half-hour in any pleasure or go\nto bed before 12 a-clock; to which, by the grace of God I will be\ntrue. Then to bed. When I came home, I found that tomorrow\nbeing Sunday, I should gain nothing by doing it tonight, and\ntomorrow I can do it very well and better then tonight: I went to\nbed before my time, but with a resolution of doing the thing to\nbetter purpose tomorrow."

Thence forward to Barnett and\nthere drank, and so by night to Stevenige, it raininga\nlittle but not\nmuch; and there to my great trouble find that my wife was not\n412\ncome, nor any Stamford coach gone down this week, so that she\ncannot come.

So I to Whitehall by coach\nwith Mr. Andrews; and there I got his contract for the victualling of\nTanger signed and sealed by us there. So that all that business is well\nover, and I hope to have made a good business of it — and to receive\n100! by it the next week — for which God be praised. Thence to W.\nJoyces and Anthonys to invite them to dinner to meet my aunt\nJames at my house. So home, having called upon Doll, our pretty\nChange woman, for a pair of gloves trimmed with yellow ribbon\n(to [the] petticoat she bought yesterday), which costs me 20s. But\nshe is so pretty, that, God forgive me, I could not think it too much;\nwhich is a strange slavery that I stand in to beauty, that I value\nnothing near it. So going home and my coach stopping in Newgate\nmarket over against a poulterer’s shop, I took occasion to buy a\nrabbit; but it proved a deadly old one when I came to eat it—as I did\ndo after an hour’s being at my office; and after supper, again there\ntill past 11 at night. And so home and to bed. This day, Mr.\nCoventry did tell us how the Duke did receive the Dutch\nEmbassador the other day — by telling him that whereas they think\nus in Jest, he believes that the Prince (Rupert), which goes in this\nfleet to guinny, will soon tell them that we are in earnest; and that he\nhimself will do the like here in the head of fleet here at home. And\nthat for the Meschants,' which he told the Duke there were in\nEngland which did hope to do themselfs good by the King’s being\nat war, says he, “‘the English have ever united all this private\n1. Miscreants, sc. Puritan fanatics.\n422\n>\ndifferences to attend Forraigne,”’ and that Cromwell, notwith-\nstanding the Meschants in his time (which were the Cavaliers), he\ndid never find them interrupt him in his foreign businesses. And\nthat he did not doubt but to live to see the Dutch as fearful of\nprovoking the English under the government of a King, as he\nremembers them to have been under that of a Coquin. I writ all this\nstory to my Lord Sandwich tonight into the Downes, it being very\ngood and true, word for word from Mr. Coventry today."

When I told him of what\nI found writ in a French book of one Monsieur Sorbiere, that gives\nan account of his observations here in England — among other\nthings, he says that it is reported that Cromwell did in his life-time\ntranspose many of the bodies of the kings of England from one\ngrave to another, and that by that means it is not known certainly\nwhether the head that is now set up upon apost be that of Cromwell\nor of one of the kings — Mr. White tells me that he believes he never\nhad so poor a low thought in him to trouble himself about. He says\nthe hand of God is much to be seen; that all his children are in good\ncondition enough as to estate, and that their relations that betrayed\ntheir family are all now either hanged or very miserable."

I entended to\nhave seen the Quakers, who they say do meet every Lord’s day at\nthe Mouth at Bishopsgate; but I could see none stirring, nor was it\nfit to ask for the place. So I walked over Moorefields, and thence to\nClerkenwell church and there (as I wished) sat next pew to the fair\nButler, who endeed is a most perfect beauty still. And oneI do very\nmuch admire myself for my choice of her fora beauty — she having\nthe best lower part of her face that ever I saw all days of my life.\nAfter church I walked to my Lady Sandwiches through my Lord\nSouthamptons new buildings in the fields behind Grays Inn; and\nendeed they are very great and a noble work. So I dined with my\nLady; and the same innocent discourse that we used to have. Only,\nafter dinner, being alone, she asked me my opinion about Creed,\n428\nwhether he would have a wife or no and what he was worth, and\nproposed Mrs. Wright for him; which she says she heard he was\nonce enquiring after. She desired I would take a good time and\nmanner of proposing it; and I said I would, though I believed he\nwould love nothing but money, and much was not to be expected\nthere she said.

He,\ninstead of opposing (which endeed had been to no purpose, but\nonly to maintain honour), did poorly go on board himself to ask\nwhat DeRuter would have; and so yielded to whatever Ruyter\nwould desire. The King and Duke are highly vexed at it, it seems,\nand the business deserves it. Thence home to dinner and then\nabroad to buy some things; and among others, to my bookseller’s\nand there saw several books Ispoke for, which are finely bound and\ngood books, to my great content. So home and to my office, where\nlate. This evening, I being informed, did look and saw the Comett,\nwhich is now, whether worn away or no I know not, but appears\nnot witha tail; but only is larger and duller then any other star, and\nis come to rise betimes and to make a\ngreat arch, and is gone quite to\na new place in the heavens then it was before — but I hope, in a\nclearer night something more will be seen.

Then home to dinner; and after\ndinner to read in Rusworths Collections about the charge against the\nlate Duke of Buckingham, in order to the fitting me to speak and\nunderstand the discourse anon before the King, about the suffering\nthe Turkey merchants to send out their fleet at this dangerous time,\nwhen we can neither spare them ships to go, nor men nor King’s\nships to convoy them. At 4 a-clock with Sir W. Penn in his coach to\nmy Lord Chancellors, where by and by Mr. Coventry, Sir W.\nPenn, Sir\nJ.Lawson, Sir G. Ascue, and myself were called in to the\nKing, there being several of the Privy Council, and my Lord\nChancellor lying at length upon a couch (of the goute I suppose);\nand there Sir W. Penn begun, and he had prepared heads in a paper\nand spoke pretty well to purpose, but with so much leisure and\n461\n1665 15 January\ngravity as was tiresome — besides, the things he said was but very\npoor to a man in his trade after a great consideration. But it was to\npurpose endeed, to dissuade the King from letting these Turkey\nships to go out — saying (in short), the King having resolved to have\n130 ships out by the spring, he must have above 20 of them\nmerchantmen-— towards which, he in the whole river could find but\n12 or 14; and of them, the five ships taken up by these merchants\nwere a part, and so could not be spared. That we should need 30000\nto man these 130 ships; and of them in service we have not above\n16000, so we shall need 14000 more. That these ships will with their\nconvoys carry above 2000 men, and those the best men that could\nbe got, it being the men used to the southward that are the best men\nfor war, though those bred in the north among the Colliers are\ngood for labour. That it will not be safe for the merchants, nor\nhonourable for the King, to expose these rich ships with his convoy\nof six ships to go, it not being enough to secure them against the\nDutch, who without doubt will have a great fleet in the Straights.\nThis, Sir\nJ.Lawson enlarged upon. Sir G. Ascu, he chiefly spoke\nthat the warr and trade could not be supported together — and\ntherefore, that trade must stand still to give way to that. This Mr.\nCoventry seconded, and showed how the medium of the men the\nKing hath, one year with another, imployed in his Navy since his\ncoming, hath not been above 3000 men, or at most 4000 men; and\nnow having occasion of 30000, the remaining 26000 must be found\nout of the trade of the nation. He showed how the Cloaths sending\nby these merchants to Turkey are already bought and paid for to the\nworkmen, and are as many as they would send these twelve months\nor more; so the poor do not suffer by their not going, but only the\nmerchant, upon whose hands they lie dead — and so the incon-\nvenience is the less. All ended with a conviction (unless future\ndiscourse with the merchants should alter it) that it was not fit for\nthem to go out, though the ships be loaded. Staying without, my\nLord Fitzharding came thither and fell to discourse of Prince\nRupert, and made nothing to say that his disease was the pox and\nthat he must be Fluxed, telling the horrible degree’ of the disease\nupon him, with its breaking out on his head. But above all, I\nobserved how he observed from the Prince that Courage is not\nwhat men take it to be, a contempt ofdeath; “For,” says he, “Show\nChagrin the Prince was the other day when he thought he should\ndie — having no more mind to it then another man; but,” says he,\n“some men are more apt to think they shall escape then another\n462\n. Samuel Pepys, by John Hayls, 1666. He holds the manuscript ofhis song,\n?\nBeauty Retir\n2. Elizabeth Pepys, from an engraving by James Thomson after the portrait by\nJohn Hayls, 1666\nman in fight, while another is doubtful he shall be hit. But when the\nfirst man is sure he shall die, as now the Prince is, he is as much\ntroubled and apprehensive of it as any man else. For,” says he,\n“‘sence we told him that we believe he would overcome his disease,\nhe is as merry, and swears and laughs and curses and doth all the\nthings of a [man] in health, as ever he did in his life’”’ — which\nmethought was a most extraordinary saying, before a great many\npersons there of quality. So by and by with Sir W. Penn home\nagain; and after supper to the office to finish my vows, and so to\nbed."

Now this day, I am dividing my expense, to see what my\nclothes and every perticular hath stood me in; I mean, all the\nbranches of my expense. At noon, a good venison pasty and a\nturkey to ourselfs, without anybody so much as invited by us — a\nthing unusual for so small a family of my condition — but we did it\nand were very merry. After dinner to my office again, where very\nlate alone upon my accounts, but have not brought them to order\nyet; and very intricate Ifind it, notwithstanding my care all the year\nto keep things in as good method as any man can do. Past 11 a-\nclock, home to supper and to bed.\n2. Up, and it being a most fine hard frost, I walked a good way\ntoward Whitehall; and then being overtaken with Sir W. Penn’s\ncoach, went into it, and with him thither and there did our usual\nbusiness with the Duke. Thence, being forced to paya great deal of\nmoney away in boxes (that is. basons at Whitehall), Ito my barbers,\nGervas’s, and there hadalittle opportunity of speaking with my\nJane alone, and did give her something. Thence to the Swan, and\nthere did sport a good while with Herbert’s young kinswoman\nwithout hurt though, they being abroad, the old people. Then to\nthe hall, and there agreed with Mrs. Martin, and to her lodgings\nwhich she hath now taken to lie in, in Bowe streete — pitiful poor\nthings, yet she thinks them pretty; and so they are for her condition\nI believe, good enough. Here I did ce que je voudrais avec her most\nfreely; and ithaving cost me 2s. in wine and cake upon her, I away,\nsick of her impudence — and by coach to my Lord Brunkers by\nappointment, in the piazza in Covent Guarding — where I\noccasioned much mirth with a ballet Ibrought with me, made from\nthe seamen at sea to their ladies in town — saying Sir W. Penn, Sir G.\n458\nAscue, and Sir\nJ.Lawson made them. Here a most noble French\ndinner and banquet, the best Ihave seen these many a day, and good\ndiscourse. Thence to my bookseller’s and at his binders saw Hookes\nbook of the Microscope, which is so pretty that I presently bespoke\nit; and away home to the office, where we met to do something; and\nthen, though very late, by coach to Sir Ph. Warwickes; but having\ncompany with him, could not speak with him. So back again home,\nwhere, thinking to be merry, was vexed with my wife’s having\nlooked out a letter in Sir Ph. Sidny about jealousy for me to read,\nwhich she industriously and maliciously caused me to do; and the\ntruth is, my conscience told me it was most proper for me, and\ntherefore was touched at it; but took no notice of it, but read it out\nmost frankly. But it stuck in my stomach; and moreover, I was\nvexed to have a dog brought to my house to lime our little bitch,\nwhich they make him do in all their sights; which God forgive me,\ndoth stir my Jealousy again, though of itself the thing is a very\nimmodest sight. However, to Cards with my wife a good while,\nand then to bed."

Came home; I to the taking my wife’s kitchen account at\nthe latter end of the month, and there find 7s. wanting — which did\noccasion a very high falling out between us; I endeed too eagerly\ninsisting upon so poor a thing, and did give her very provoking\nwords, calling her ‘‘beggar” and reproaching her friends;* which\nshe took very stomachfully, and reproached me justly with mine;\nand I confess, being myself, I cannot see what she could have done\nless. Ifind she is very cunning, and when she least shows it, hath her\nwit at work; but it is an ill one, though I think not so bad but with\ngood usage I might well bear with it; and the truth is, I do find that\nmy being over-solicitous and jealous and froward, and ready to\nreproach her, doth make her worse. However, | find that now and\nthena little difference doth do not hurt — but too much of it will\nmake her know her force too much. We parted, after many high\nwords, very angry; and I to my office to my month’s accounts, and\nfind myself worth 1270/ — for which the Lord God be praised. So, at\nalmost 2 a-clock in the morning, I home to supper and to bed.\nAnd so ends this month, with great expectation of the Hol-\n473\n1665 28 February—7 March\nlanders coming forth; who are, it seems, very high and rather more\nready then we. God give a good issue to it.\n—%MARCH-\n1. Up-—and this day being the day that, by a promise a great while\nago made to my wife, I was to give her 20/ to lay out in clothes\nagainst Easter, she did, notwithstanding last night’s falling-out,\ncome to peace with me and I with her, but did boggle mightily at\nthe parting with my money, but at last did give it her; and then she\nabroad to, buy her things, and I to my office, where busy all the\nmorning. At noon I to dinner at Trinity house — and thence to\nGresham College, where, first Mr. Hooke read a second very\ncurious* Lecture about the late Comett, among other things,\nproving very probably that this is the very same Comett that\nappeared before in the year 1618, and that in such a time probably it\nwill appear again — which is a very new opinion — but all will be in\nprint. Then to the meeting, where Sir G. Carterets two sons, his\nown and Sir N. Slany, were admitted of the Society. And this day I\ndid pay my admission money — 40s. — to the Society. Here was very\nfine discourses — and experiments; but I do lack philosophy enough\nto understand them, and so cannot remember them. Among\nothers, a very perticular account of the making of the several sorts\nof bread in France, which is accounted the best place for bread in the\nworld.\n4. Up very betimes; and walked, it being bitter cold, to Ratcliffe\nto the plat-maker’s and back again. To the office, where we sat all\nthe morning. I, with being empty and full of ayre and wind, had\nsome pain today. Dined alone at home, my wife being gone abroad\nto buy some more things. All the afternoon at the office. At night\nhome to supper and to bed. This day was proclaimed at the Change\nthe war with Holland. .\n7-8. Up, and was pretty well; but going to the office, and I think\nit was sitting with my back to the fire, it set me ina great rage again,\nthat I could not continue till past noon at the office, but was forced\nto go home; nor could sit down to dine, but betook myself to my\nbed; and being there a while, my pain begun to abate and grow less\n474\nand less. Anon I went to make water, not dreaming of anything but\nmy testicle, that by some accident I might have bruised as I used to\ndo — but in pissing, there came from me two stones; I could feel\nthem, and caused my water to be looked into, but without any pain\nto me in going out— which makes me think that it was nota fit of the\nstone at all; for my pain was asswaged upon my lying down agreat\nwhile before I went to make water. Anon I made water again very\nfreely and plentifully. I kept my bed in good ease all the evening;\nthen rose and sat up an hour or two; and then to bed and lay till 8 a-\nclock; and then, though a bitter cold day, yet I rose, and though my\npain and tenderness in my testicle remains alittle, yet I do verily\nthink that my pain yesterday was nothing else, and therefore Ihope\nmy disease of the stone may not return to me, but void itself in\npissing; which God grant — but I will consult my physitian. This\nmorning is brought me to the office the sad news of the London, in\nwhich Sir\nJ.Lawsons men were all bringing her from Chatham to\nthe Hope, and thence he was to go to sea in her — but a little a-this-\nside the buoy of the Nower, she suddenly blew up. About 24 and a\nwoman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest,\nbeing above 300, drowned — the ship breaking all in pieces — with 80\npieces of brass ordinance. She lies sunk, with her round-house\nabove water. Sir\nJ.Lawson hatha great loss in this, of so many good\nchosen men, and many relations among them. I went to the\nChange, where the news taken very much to heart. So home to\ndinner, and Mr. Moore with me; then I to Gresham College and\nthere saw several pretty experiments; and so home and to my office\n—and at night, about 11, home to supper and to bed."

So being both well pleased with the\nproposition, I saw his neece there and made her sing me two or\nthree songs, very prettily; and so home to the office — where to my\ngreat trouble, I found Mr. Coventry and the board met before I\ncame. I excused my late coming, by having been upon the River\nabout office business. So to business all the morning. [After dinner]\nto Dr. Clerke, and there find that he hath broke the business to Sir\nG. Carteret and that he takes the thing mighty well. Thence I to Sir\nG. Carteret at his Chamber, and in the best manner I could, and\nmost obligingly, moved that business; he received it with great\nrespect and content and thanks to me, and promised that he would\ndo what he could possibly for his son, to render him fit for my\nLord’s daughter. And showed great kindness to me, and sense of\nmy kindness to him herein. Sir Wm. Pen told me this day that Mr.\nCoventry is to be sworn a Privy Counsellor — at which my soul is\nglad.

And\namong other things, he told me he was not for the Fanfarroons, to\nmake a show witha great Title, as he might have had long since, but\nthe main thing to get an estate; and another thing, speaking of\nminding of business, ““By God,” says he, “‘I will, and have already\nalmost brought it to that pass, that the King shall not be able to\nwhip a cat but Imust be at the tayle of it” — meaning, so necessary he\nis, and the King and my Lord Treasurer and all do confess it.\nWhich, while I mind my business, is my own case in this office of\nthe Navy; and I hope shall be more, if God give me life and health.\nThence by agreement to Sir\nJ.Minnes’s lodgings, where I find my\nLord Bruncker; and so by water to the Ferry, and there took Sir W.\nBatten’s coach that was sent for us and to Sir W. Battens, where\nvery merry, good cheer, and up and down the garden, with great\ncontent to me. And after dinner beat Capt. Cocke at Billiards; won\nabout 8s. of him and my Lord Bruncker. So in the evening, after\nmuch pleasure, back again — and I by water to Woolwich, where\nsupped with my wife; and then to bed betimes, because of rising\ntomorrow at 4 of the clock, in order to the going out with Sir G.\nCarteret toward Cranborne to meet my Lord Hinchingbrooke in\nhis way to Court. This night I did present my wife with the\nDyamond ring a while since given me by Mr. [?Blayton], Dicke\nVines’s brother, for helping him to be a purser — valued at about tol\n—the first thing of that nature I did ever give her. Great fears we\nhave that the plague will be a great Bill this week."

Carteret and my Lady ready to go —I being in my new\ncoloured-silk suit and coat, trimmed with gold buttons and gold\nbraid lace round my hands, very rich and fine. By water to the\nFerry, where, when we came, no coach there—and tide of ebb so far\nspent as the horse-boat could not get off on the other side the river\nto bring away the coach. So we were fain to stay there in the\nunlucky Isle of Doggs — in a chill place, the morning cool and wind\n$09\n1665 31 July\nfresh, above two if not three hours, to our great discontent. Yet\nbeing upon a pleasant errand, and seeing that could not be helped,\nwe did bear it very patiently; and it was worth my observing, I\nthought as ever anything, to see how upon these two scores, Sir G.\nCarteret, the most passionate man in the world and that was in\ngreatest haste to be gone, did bear with it, and very pleasant all the\nwhile, at least not troubled much so as to fret and storm at it. Anon\nthe coach comes — in the meantime there comingacitizen thither\nwith his horse to go over, that told us he did come from Islington\nthis morning, and that Proctor the vintener of the Miter in\nWoodstreet, and his son, is dead this morning there —of the plague.\nHe having laid out abundance of money there —and was the greatest\nvintener for some time in London for great entertainments. We\nfearing the canonicall hour would be past before we got thither, did\nwith a great deal of unwillingness send away the Licence and\nwedding-ring. So that when we came, though we drove hard with\nsix horses, yet we found them gone from home; and going toward\nthe church, met them coming from church — which troubled us.\nBut however, that trouble was soon over\n— hearing it was well done\n— they being both in their old Cloaths. My Lord Crew giving her —\nthere being three coach-fulls of them. The young lady mighty sad,\nwhich troubled me; but yet I think it was only her gravity, ina little\ngreater degree then usual. All saluted her, but I did not till my Lady\nSandwich did ask me whether I had not saluted her or no. So to\ndinner, and very merry we were; but yet in such a Sober way as\nnever almost any wedding was in so great families — but it was\nmuch better. After dinner, company divided, some to cards —\nothers to talk. My Lady Sandwich and I up to settle accounts and\npay her some money —and mighty kind she is to me, and would fain\nhave had me gone down for company with her to Hinchingbrooke\n— but for my life I cannot. At night to supper, and so to talk and,\nwhich methought was the most extraordinary thing, all of us to\nprayers as usual, and the young Bride and bridegroom too. And so\nafter prayers, Soberly to bed; only, I got into the bridegroom’s\nchamber while he undressed himself, and there was very merry —\ntill he was called to the bride’s chamber and into bed they went. I\nkissed the bride in bed, and so the curtaines drawne with the\ngreatest gravity that could be, and so good-night. But the modesty\nand gravity of this business was so decent, that it was to me,\nendeed, ten times more delightful then if it had been twenty times\nmore merry and Joviall. Whereas I feared I must have sat up all\n510\n31 July 1665\nnight, we did here all get good beds — andI lay in the same I did\nbefore, with Mr. Brisband, who is a good scholar and sober man;\nand we lay in bed, getting him to give me an account of Rome,\nwhich is the most delightful talk a man can have of any traveller.\nAnd so to sleep — my eyes much troubled already with the change of\nmy drink.\nThus I ended this month with the greatest joy that ever I did any\nin my life, because I have spent the greatest part of it with\nabundance of joy and honour, and pleasant Journys and brave\nentertainments, and without cost of money. And at last live to see\nthat business ended with great content on all sides. This evening\nwith Mr. Brisband speaking of inchantments and spells, I telling\nhim some of my Charmes, he told me this of his own knowledge at\nBourdeaux in France. The words these —\nVoicy un Corps mort\nRoyde comme un Baston\nFroid comme Marbre\nLeger comme un Esprit,\nLevons te au nom de Jesus Christ.\nHe saw four little Girles, very young ones, all kneeling, each of\nthem upon one knee; and one begin the first line, whispering in the\neare of the next, and the second to the third, and the third to the\nfourth, and she to the first. Then the first begun the second line, and\nso round quite through. And putting each one finger only to a boy\nthat lay flat upon his back on the ground, as if he was dead. At the\nend of the words, they did with their four fingers raise this boy as\nhigh as they could reach. And he being there and wondering at it (as\nalso being afeared to see it — for they would have had him to have\nbore a part in saying the words in the room of one of the little girls,\nthat was so young that they could hardly make her learn to repeat\nthe words), did, for fear there might be some sleight used in it by\nthe boy, or that the boy might be light, called the cook of the house,\navery lusty fellow, as Sir G. Carteret’s Cooke, who is very big, and\nthey did raise him just in the same manner. This is one of the\nstrangest things I ever heard, but he tells it me of his own\nknowledge and I do heartily believe it to be true. I enquired of him\nwhether they were Protestant or Catholique girls, and he told me\nthey were Protestant — which made it the more strange to me.\nThus we end this month, as I said, after the greatest glut of\nSII\n1665 31 July—6 August\ncontent that ever I had; only, under some difficulty because of the\nplague, which grows mightily upon us, the last week being about\n1700 or 1800 of the plague. My Lord Sandwich, at sea witha\nfleet of\nabout 100 sail to the Norward, expect De Ruyter or the Duch East\nIndia fleet. Myself having obliged both these families in this\nbusiness very much, as both my Lady and Sir G. Carteret and his\nLady do confess exceedingly; and the latter two also now call me\nCosen, which I am glad of. So God preserve us all friends long, and\ncontinue health among us.\n—“AUGUST\n#-\n1. Slept and lay long, then up; and my Lord and Sir G. Carteret\nbeing gone abroad, I first to see the bridegroom and bride, and\nfound them both up, and he gone to dress himself. Both red in the\nface and well enough pleased this morning with their night’s\nlodging. Thence down, and Mr. Brisband andI to Billiards. Anon\ncame my Lord and Sir G. Carteret in, who had been looking abroad\nand visiting some farms that Sir G. Carteret hath thereabouts — and\namong other things, report the greatest stories of the bigness of the\nCalfes they find there ready to sell to the butchers; as big, as they\nsay, as little Cowes. And that they do give them a piece of Chalke to\nlick, which they hold makes them white in the flesh within. Very\nmerry at Dinner, and so to talk and laugh after dinner, and up and\ndown, some to [one] place, some to another — full of content on all\nsides. Anon, about § a-clock, Sir G. Carteret and his lady and I took\ncoach, with the greatest joy and kindness that could be from the\ntwo families — or that ever I saw with so much appearance, and I\nbelieve reality, in all my life. Drove hard home, and it was night ere\nwe got to Deptford— where, with much kindness from them to me,\nI left them; and home to the office, where I find all well. And being\nweary and sleepy, it being very late, I to bed.\n6. Lords day. Dressed and had my head combed by my little girle,\nto whom Iconfess que je sum demasiado kind, nuper ponendo sepe\nmes mains in su dos choses de son breast. Mais ilfaut queje leave it,\nlest it bring me to alguno major inconvenience. So to my business\nin my chamber — look[ing] over and settling more of my papers\nthen I could do the two last days I have spent about them.

After dinner my Lord and his mistress would\nsee her home again, it being a most cursed rainy afternoon, having\nhad none a great while before. And I, forced to go to the office on\nfoot through all the rain, was almost wet to the skin, and spoiled my\nsilk breeches almost.

We fell to talk\nlargely of the want of some persons understanding to look after\nbusinesses, but all goes to wrack. “For,” says Capt. Cocke, ‘““My\nLord Treasurer, he minds his ease and lets things go how they will;\nifhe can have his 8000! per annum and a game at Lombre, he is well.\nMy Lord Chancellor, he minds getting of money and nothing else;\nand my Lord Ashly will rob the devil and the Alter but he will get\nmoney if it be to be got.” But that that puts us into this great\nmelancholy was news brought today, which Capt. Cocke reports\nas a certain truth, that all the Dutch fleet, men-of-war and merchant\nEast India ships, are got every one in from Bergen the 3rd of this\nmonth, Sunday last — which will make us all ridiculous. The fleet\ncame home with shame to require great deal of money, which is not\nto be had—to discharge many men, that must get the plague then or\ncontinue at greater charge on shipboard. Nothing done by them to\nencourage the Parliament to give money —nor the Kingdom able to\nspare any money ifthey would, at this time of the plague. So that as\nthings look at present, the whole state must come to Ruine. Full of\nthese melancholy thoughts, to bed— where thoughI lay the saftest I\never did in my life, with a down bed (after the Danish manner, upon\nme), yet I slept very ill, chiefly through the thoughts of my Lord\nSandwiches concernment in all this ill-success at sea."

Cuttle. This\nnews doth so overjoy me, that I know not what to say enough to\nexpress it; but the better to do it, I did walk to Greenwich: and there\nsending away Mr. Andrews, I to Capt. Cocke’s where I find my\nLord Brouncker and his mistress and Sir J. Mennes — where we\nsupped (there was also Sir W. Doyly and Mr. Eveling); but the\nreceipt of this news did put us all into such an extasy ofjoy, that it\ninspired into Sir\nJ.Mennes and Mr. Eveling sucha spirit of mirth,\nthat in all my life I never met with so merry a two hours as our\n524\n10-14 September | 1665\ncompany this night was. Among other humours, Mr. Eveling’s\nrepeating of some verses made up of nothing but the various\nacceptations of May and Can, and doing it so aptly, upon occasion\nof something of that nature, and so fast, did make us all die almost\nwith laughing, and did so stop the mouth of Sir\nJ.Mennes in the\nmiddle of all his mirth (and in a thing agreeing with his own manner\nof Genius) that I never saw any man so out-done in all my life; and\nSir\nJ.Mennes’s mirth too, to see himself out-done, was the crown\nof all our mirth. In this humour we sat till about 10 at night; and so\nmy Lord and his mistress home, and we to bed — it being one of the\ntimes of my life wherein I was the fullest of true sense of joy.\n13. Up, and walked to Greenwich, taking pleasure to walk with\nmy minute wach in my hand, by which I am now come to see the\ndistances of my way from Woolwich to Greenwich. And do find\nmyself to come within two minutes constantly to the same place at\nthe end of each quarter of an hour. Here we Rendezvoused at Capt.\nCocke’s and there eat oysters; and so my Lord Brouncker, Sir J.\nMennes and I took the boat; and in my Lord’s coach to Sir W.\nHickes’s, whither by and by my Lady Batten and Sir Wm. comes. It\nis a good seat — witha fair grove of trees by it, and the remains of a\ngood garden. But so let to run to ruine, both house and everything\nin and about it — so ill furnished and miserably looked after, I never\ndid see in all my life. Not so muchas a\nlatch to his dining-room door\n— which saved him nothing, for the wind blowing into the room for\nwant thereof, flung down a great Bowpott that stood upon the side-\ntable, and that fell upon some Venice glasses and did him a crown’s\nworth of hurt. He did give us the meanest dinner — of beef —\nshoulder and umbles of venison which he takes away from the\nkeeper of the Forest — and a few pigeons; and all in the meanest\nmanner that ever I did see — to the basest degree. After dinner we\nofficers of the Navy stepped aside to read some letters and consider\nsome business, and so in again. I was only pleased at a very fine\npicture of the Queene Mother\n— when she was young, by Van Dike;\na very good picture and a lovely sweet face.\n14. Up, and walked to Greenwich and there fitted myself in\nseveral businesses to go to London, where I have not been now a\npretty while. But before I went from the office, news is brought by\nword of mouth that letters are now just now brought from the\nFleete of our taking a great many more of the Dutch fleet —in which\n$25\n1665 14 September\nI did never more plainly see my command of my temper, in my not\nadmitting myself to receive any kind ofjoy from it till I had heard\nthe certainty of it. And therefore went by water directly to the Duke\nof Albemarle, where I find a letter of the 12th from Soldbay, from\nmy Lord Sandwich, of the fleet’s meeting with about 18 more of the\nDutch fleet and his taking of most of them; and the messenger says\nthey had taken three after the letter was wrote and sealed; which\nbeing 21, and the 14 took the other day, is [35] sail— some of which\nare good, and others rich ships — which is so great a cause ofjoy in us\nall, that my Lord and everybody is highly joyed thereat. And\nhaving taken a copy of my Lord’s letter, I away back again to the\nBear at the Bridge foot, being full of wind and out of order, and\nthere called for a biscuit and a piece of cheese and gill of sack\n— being\nforced to walk over the Bridge toward the Change, and the plague\nbeing all thereabouts. Here my news was highly welcome, and I did\nwonder to see the Change so full, I believe 200 people; but not a\nman or merchant of any fashion, but plain men all. And Lord, to see\nhow I did endeavour all I could to talk with as few as I could, there\nbeing now no observation of shutting up of houses infected, that to\nbe sure we do converse and meet with people that have the plague\nupon them. I to Sir Rob. Viners, where my main business was\nabout settling the business of Debusty’s 5000! tallies — which I did\nfor the present to enable me to have some money. And so home,\nbuying some things for my wife in the way. So home and put up\nseveral things to carry to Woolwich — and upon serious thoughts, I\nam advised by W. Griffin to let my money and plate rest there, as\nbeing as safe as any place, nobody imagining that people would\nleave money in their houses now, when all their families are gone.\nSo for the present, that being my opinion, I did leave them there\nstill. But Lord, to see the trouble that it puts a man to to keep safe\nwhat with pain a man hath been getting together; and there is good\nreason for it. Down to the office, and there wrote letters to and\nagain about this good news of our victory, and so by water home\nlate —\nWhere when I came home, I spent some thoughts upon the\noccurrences of this day, giving matter for as much content on one\nhand and melancholy on another as any day in all my life — for the\nfirst, the finding of my money and plate and all safe at London, and\nspeeding in my business of money this day — the hearing of this\ngood news, to such excess after so great a despair of my Lord’s\ndoing anything this year — adding to that, the decrease of 500 and\n526\n10.

George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, by Sir Peter Lely\nmore, which is the first decrease we have yet had in the sickness\nsince it begun —and great hopes that the next week it will be greater.\nThen on the other side— my finding that though the Bill in general is\nabated, yet the City within the walls is encreased and likely to\ncontinue so, and is close to our house there — my meeting dead\ncorps’s of the plague, carried to be buried close to me at noonday\nthrough the City in Fanchurch street — to see a person sick of the\nsores carried close by me by Grace church in a hackney-coach — my\nfinding the Angell tavern at the lower end of Tower hill shut up;\nand more then that, the alehouse at the Tower stairs; and more then\nthat, that the person was then dying of the plague when I was last\nthere, a little while ago at night, to write a short letter there, and I\noverheard the mistress of the house sadly saying to her husband\nsomebody was very ill, but did not think it was of the plague — to\nhear that poor Payne my water[man] hath buried a child and is\ndying himself — to hear that a labourer I sent but the other day to\nDagenhams to know how they did there is dead of the plague; and\nthat one of my own watermen, that carried me daily, fell sick as\nsoon as he had landed me on Friday morning last, when I had been\nall night upon the water (andI believed he did get his infection that\nday at Brainford) is now dead of the plague — to hear that Capt.\nLambert and Cuttle are killed in the taking these ships and that Mr.\nSidny Mountague is sick of a desperate fever at my Lady Carteret’s\nat Scott’s hall—to hear that Mr. Lewes hath another daughter sick —\nand lastly, that both my servants, W. Hewers and Tom Edwards,\nhave lost their fathers, both in St. Sepulcher’s parish, of the plague\nthis week — doth put me into great apprehensions of melancholy,\nand with good reason. ButI put off the thoughts of sadness as much\nas I can; and the rather to keep my wife in good heart, and family\nalso. After supper (having eat nothing all day) upon a fine Tench of\nMr. Sheldens taking, we to bed."

And so that being done, I downstairs and there find\nCapt. Cocke under the barber’s hands — the barber that did\nheretofore trim Comissioner Pett, and with whom I have been. He\noffered to come this day after dinner with his violin, to play mea set\nof Lyra ayres upon it, which I was glad of, hoping to be merry\nthereby. Being ready, we to church, where a company of fine\npeople to church, anda fine church and very good sermon (Mr.\nPlume being a very excellent scholler and preacher); coming out of\nthe church, I met Mrs. Pierce, whom I was shamed to see, having\nnot been with her since my coming to town — but promised to visit\n§28\nher. Thence with Capt. Cocke (in his coach) home to dinner,\nwhither comes by invitation My Lord Bruncker and his mistress,\nand very good company we were. But in dinner-time comesSirJo.\nMinnes from the fleet like a simple weak man, having nothing to\nsay of what he hath done there, but tells us of what value he\nimagines the prizes to be, and that my Lord Sandwich is well and\nmightily concerned to hear that I was well. But this did put me\nupon a desire of going thither; and moving of it to my Lord, we\npresently agreed upon it to go this very Tide, we two and Capt.\nCocke. So everybody prepared to fit himself for his Journy, and I\nwalked to Woolwich to trim and shift myself; and by the time I was\nready they came down in the Bezan Yacht, and so I aboard and my\nboy Tom. And there very merrily we sailed to below Gravesend,\nand there came to Anchor for all night and supped and talked, and\nwith much pleasure at last settled ourselfs to sleep — having very\ngood lodging upon Cushions in the Cabbin."

    "text": "By break of day we came to within sight of the fleet, which\nwas a very fine thing to behold, being above 100 ships, great and\nsmall — with the flag-ships of each squadron distinguished by their\nseveral flags on their main, fore, or mizzen masts. Among others,\nthe Soveraigne, Charles, and Prince, in the last of which my Lord\nSandwich was. When we called by her side, his Lordship was not\nstirring; so we came to anchor alittle below his ship, thinking to\n-have rowed on board him; but the wind and tide was so strong\nagainst us that we could not get up to him; no, though rowed by a\nboat of the Prince’s that came to us to tow us up; at last, however, he\nbrought us within a\nlittle way, and then they flung out a rope to us\nfrom the Prince, and so came on board, but with great trouble and\ntime and patience, it being very cold. We find my Lord newly up in\nhis nightgown, very well. He received us kindly, telling us the state\nof the fleet; lacking provisions, having no beer at all, nor have had\nmost of them these three weeks or month, and but few days’ dry\nprovisions. And endeed, he tells us that he believes no fleet was ever\nset to sea in so ill condition of provision as this was when it went out\nlast. By and by was called a council of warr on board, when came\nSir W. Pen there — and Sir Chr. Mings, Sir Edwd. Spragg, SirJos.\nJordan, Sir Tho. Teddiman, and Sir Rogr. Cuttance. And so the\nnecessities of the fleet for victuals, clothes, and money was\ndiscoursed, but by the discourse there of all but my Lord — that is to\nsay, the counterfeit grave nonsense of Sir W. Pen and the poor mean\n$29\n1665 18 September\ndiscourse of the rest, methinks I see how the government and\nmanagement of the greatest business of the three nations is\ncommitted to very ordinary heads, saving my Lord; and in effect,\nis only upon him, who is able to do what he please with them,\nthey not having the meanest degree of reason to be able to oppose\nanything that he says. And so] fear it is ordered but like all the rest\nof the King’s public affayres. The council being up, they most of\nthem went away, only Sir W. Penn, who stayed to dine there, and\ndid so; but the wind being high, the ship (though the motion of it\nwas hardly discernible to the eye) did make me sick, so as I could\nnot eat anything almost. After dinner Cocke did pray me to help\nhim to soo! of W. How, who is Deputy-Treasurer, wherein my\nLord Bruncker and I am to be concerned; and I did ask it my Lord,\nand he did consent to have us furnished with sool, and I did get it\npaid to Sir Roger Cuttance and Mr. Pierce in part for above 1000/-\nworth of goods, Mace, Nuttmeggs, Cynamon, and Cloves. And\nhe tells us we may hope to get sool by it —- which God send. Great\nspoil, I hear, there hath been of the two East India ships, and that\nyet they will come in to the King very rich — so that I hope this\njourny will be worth rool to me.' After having paid this money,\nwe took leave of my Lord, and so to our Yacht again, having seen\nmany of my friends there. Among others, I hear that W. Howe\nwill grow very rich by this last business and grows very proud and\ninsolent by it — but it is what I ever expected. I hear by everybody\nhow much my poor Lord of Sandwich was concerned for me\nduring my silence awhile, lest I had been dead of the plague in this\nsickly time.\nNo sooner come into the Yacht, though overjoyed with the good\nwork we have done today, but Iwas overcome with seasickness, so\nthat I begun to spew soundly — and so continued a good while -till\nat last I went into the Cabbin, and shutting my eys, my trouble did\ncease, that I fell asleep; which continued till we came into Chatham\nRiver, where the water was smooth, and then I rose and was very\nwell. And the tide coming to be against us, we did land before we\ncame to Chatham and walked a mile — having very good discourse\nby the way —it being dark and it beginning to rain just as we got\n1. Two Dutch E. Indiamen (the Phoenix and the Slot van Honingen) had been\ncaptured by Sandwich. Most imprudently he had allowed his officers and seamen\nto take some of the goods before they were judged to be prize in the prize court. He\ncameunderheavy criticism andin December 1665 wassentoffto Spainas ambassador\nin consequence. Pepys very wisely soon sold the goods he now purchased.\n$30\nthither. At Comissioner Petts we did eat and drink very well, and\nvery merry we were. And about 10 at night, it being moonshine\nand very cold, we set out, his coach carrying us, and so all night\ntravelled to Greenwich — we sometimes sleeping a little, and then\ntalking and laughing by the way; and with much pleasure, but that\nit was very horrible cold, that I was afeared of an ague. A pretty\npassage was that the coach stood of\na sudden, and the coachman\ncame down, and the horses stirring, he cried “Hold!” which waked\nme; and the coach|man] standing at the boot to [do] something or\nother, and crying ‘“‘Hold!”’, I did wake of a sudden; and not\nknowing who he was nor thinking of the coachman, between\nsleeping and waking I did take up the heart to take him by the\nshoulder, thinking verily he had been a thief. But when I waked, I\nfound my cowardly heart to discover a fear within me, and that I\nshould never have done it if I had been awake."

It being a good way, he says, to get money,\nand afterward to get the King’s allowance thereof — it being easier,\nhe observes, to keep money when got of the King, then to get it\nwhen it is too late. Iadvised him not to trust Cocke too far.

Thence took leave, leaving my Lord\nSandwich to go visit the Bishop of Canterbury, and I and Sir W.\nBatten down to the tower, where he went further by water, and I\nhome; and among other things, took out all my gold to carry along\nwith me tonight with Capt.

Every day sadder and sadder news of its encrease.\nIn the City died this week 7496; and of them 6102 of the plague. But\nit is feared that the true number of the dead this week is near 10000 —\npartly from the poor that cannot be taken notice of through the\ngreatness of the number, and partly from the Quakers and others\nthat will not have any bell ring for them. Our fleet gone out to find\nthe Dutch, we having about 100 sail in our fleet, and in them, the\nSoveraigne one; so that it is a better fleet then the former with the\nDuke was. All our fear is that the Dutch should be got in before\nthem — which would bea very great sorrow to the public, and to me\nperticularly, for my Lord Sandwichs sake. A great deal of money\nbeing spent, and the Kingdom not in a condition to spare, nor a\nparliament, without much difficulty, to meet to give more. And to\nthat, to have it said ‘‘What hath been done by our late fleets?” As to\n1.

My late gettings have been very\ngreat, to my great content, and am likely to have yet a few more\nprofitable jobbs ina little while — for which, Tanger and Sir W.\nWarren I am wholly obliged to.\n-+SEPTEMBER*-\n3. Lords day. Up, and put on my colourd silk suit, very fine, and\nmy new periwigg, bought a good while since, but darst not wear it\nbecause the plague was in Westminster when I bought it. And it is a\nwonder what will be the fashion after the plague is done as to\nperiwigs, for nobody will dare to buy any haire for fear of the\ninfection — that it had been cut off of the heads of people dead of the\nplague. Before church time comes Mr. Hill (Mr. Andrews failing\nbecause he was to receive the sacrament), and to church, where a\nsorry dull parson; and so home and most excellent company with\nMr. Hill, and discourse of Musique. I took my Lady Pen home and\nher daughter Peg, and merry we were, and after dinner I made my\nwife show them her pictures, which did mad pegg Pen who learns\nof the same man—and cannot do so well. After dinner left them, and\nI by water to Greenwich, where much ado to be suffered to come\ninto the town because of the sickness, for fear I should come from\nLondon -till I told them who I was. So up to the church, where at\nthe door I find Capt. Cocke in my Lord Brunkers coach, and he\ncame out and walked with me in the churchyard till the church was\ndone. Talking of the ill-government of our Kingdom, nobody\nsetting to heart the business of the Kingdom, but everybody\nminding their perticular profit or pleasures, the King himself\nminding nothing but his ease — and so we let things go to wrack.\nThis arose upon considering what we shall do for money when the\nfleet comes in, and more ifthe fleet should not meet with the Dutch,\nwhich will put a disgrace upon the King’s actions, so as the\nParliament and Kingdom will have the less mind to give more\nmoney. Besides, so bad an account of the last money, we fear, will\nbe given; not half of it being spent, as it ought to be, upon the Navy.\nBesides, it is said that at this day our Lord Treasurer cannot tell\nwhat the profits of Chimny money is; what it comes to per annum—\n520\nnor looks whether that or any other part of the Revenue be duly\ngathered as it ought — the very money that should pay the City the\n200000! they lent the King being all gathered and in the hands of the\nReceiver, and hath been long, and yet not brought up to pay the\nCity, whereas we are coming to borrow 4 or 500000! more of the\nCity — which will never be lent as is to be feared. Church being\ndone, my Lord Brouncker, Sir\nJ.Mennes, and I up to the Vestry at\nthe desire of the Justices of the Peace, Sir Th. Bidolph and Sir W.\nBoreman and Ald. Hooker — in order to the doing something for\nthe keeping of the plague from growing; but Lord, to consider the\nmadness of people of the town, who will (because they are forbid)\ncome in Crowds along with the dead Corps to see them buried. But\nwe agreed on some orders for the prevention thereof. Among other\nstories, one was very passionate methought — of a complaint\nbrought against a man in the town for taking a child from London\nfrom an infected house. Ald. Hooker told us it was the child of a\nvery able citizen in Gracious street, a sadler, who had buried all the\nrest of his children of the plague; and himself and wife now being\nshut up, and in despairofescaping, did desire only to save the life of\nthis little child; and so prevailed to have it received stark naked into\nthe arms of a friend, who brought it (having put it into new fresh\nclothes) to Grenwich; where, upon hearing the story, we did agree\nit should be permitted to be received and kept in the town. Thence\nwith my Lord Brouncker to Capt. Cockes, where we mighty\nmerry, and supped; and very late, I by water to Woolwich, in great\napprehensions of an Ague. Here was my Lord Brouncker’s lady of\npleasure, whoI perceive goes everywhere with him, and he! find is\nobliged to carry her and make all the Courtship to her that can be."

Thence to Rochester; walked to the Crowne, and while dinner\nwas getting ready, I did there walk to visit the old Castle ruines,\nwhich hath been a noble place; and there going up, I did upon the\nstairs overtake three pretty maids or women and took them up with\nme, and] did besarlas muchas vezes et tocar leur mains and necks, to\nmy great pleasure: but Lord, to see what a dreadful thing it is to look\ndown precipices, for it did fright me mightily and hinder me of\nmuch pleasure which I would have made to myself in the company\nof these three if it had not been for that. The place hath been very\nnoble, and great and strong in former ages. So to walk up and down\n$37\nthe Cathedrall, and thence to the Crowne, whither Mr. Fowler, the\nMayor of the towne, was come in his gowne, and is a very\nReverend Magistrate. After I had eat a bit, not staying to eat with\nthem, I went away; and so took horses and to Gravesend, and there\nstayed not, but got a boat (the sickness being very much in the\nTowne still) and so called on board my Lord Bruncker andSirJo.\nMinnes, on board one of the East Indiamen at Erith, and there do\nfind them full of envious complaints for the pillageing of the ships.\nBut I did pacify them and discoursed about making money of some\nof the goods, and do hope to be the better by it honestly. So took\nleave (Madam Williams being here also with my Lord) and about 8\na-clock got to Woolwich; and there supped and mighty pleasant\nwith my wife, who is, for aught I\nsee, all friends with her maids; and\nso in great joy and content to bed."

He gone, I to the office till night; and then they come\nand tell me my wife is come to town, so I to her, vexed at her\ncoming; but it was upon innocent business, and so Iwas pleased and\nmade her stay, Capt. Ferrers and his lady being yet there. And so I\nleft them to dance, and I to the office till past 9 at night; and so to\nthem and there saw them dance very prettily, the Captain and his\nwife, my wife, and Mrs. Barbary and Mercer, and my landlady’s\ndaughter; and then little Mrs. Fr. Tooker and her mother, a pretty\nwoman, come to see my wife.

The\ngreat burden we have upon us at this time at the office is the\nproviding for prisoners and sick men that are recovered, they lying\nbefore our office doors all night and all day, poor wretches. Having\nbeen on shore, the Captains won’t receive them on board, and other\nships we have not to put them on, nor money to pay them off or\nprovide for them. God remove this difficulty.

Thence, mighty merry and much\npleased with the dinner and company, and they with me, I parted;\nand there was set upon by the poor wretches, whom I did give\nwords and some little money to; and the poor people went away\nlike lambs, and in good earnest are not to be censured if their\nnecessities drive them to bad Courses of stealing or the like, while\nthey lack wherewith to live. Thence to the office, and there wrote a\nletter or two and despatched a little business; and then to Capt.\nCocke’s, where I find Mr..Temple, the fat blade, Sir Rob.

For all which,\nthe Lord God be praised.\n~&OCTOBER#-\n1. Lords day. Called up about 4of the clock, and so dressed myself;\nand so on board the Bezan, and there finding all my company\nasleep, Iwould not wake them; but it beginning to be breakofday, I\ndid stay upon the Decke walking and then into the Maisters Cabbin\nand there leaned and slept a little; and so at last was wakened by\nCapt. Cockes calling of me, and so I turned out, and then to chat\nand talk and laugh, and mighty merry. We spent most of the\nmorning talking, and reading of The Seige of Rhodes, which is\ncertainly (the more I read it the more | think so) the best poem that\never was wrote. We breakfasted betimes and came to the fleet about\n2 of the clock in the afternoon, having a fine day and a fine winde.\nMy Lord received us mighty kindly; and after discourse with us in\ngeneral, left us to our business, and he to his officers, having called a\ncouncil of Warr. We in the meantime settling of papers with Mr.\nPierce and everybody else, and by and by with Capt. Cuttance.\nAnon called down to my Lord, and there with him till supper,\ntalking and discourse. Among other things, to my great joy he did\nassure me that he had wrote to the King and Duke about these prize\ngoods, and told me that they did approve of what he had done and\nthat he would own what he had done, and would have me to tell all\nthe world so; and did under his hand give Cocke and me his\nCertificate of our bargains, and giving us full power of disposal of\nwhat we have so bought. This doth ease my mind of all my fear,\nand makes my heart lighter by 1toolb then it was before. He did\ndiscourse to us of the Dutch fleet being abroad, 85 of them still, and\nare now at the Texell he believes, in expectation of our Eastland\nships coming home with masts and hemp, and -our loaden\nHambrough ships going to Hambrough. He discoursed against\nthem that would have us yield to no conditions but conquest over\nthe Dutch, and seems to believe that the Dutch will call for the\nprotection of the King of France and come under his power — which\nwere to be wished they might be brought to do under ours, by fair\nmeans; and to that end would have all Dutchmen and families that\n536\nwould come hither and settled, to be declared Denizens. And my\nLord did whisper to me alone, that things here must break in pieces,\nnobody minding anything, but every man his own business of\nprofit or pleasure, and the King some little designs of his own; and\nthat certainly the Kingdom could not stand in this condition long —\nwhich I fear and believe is very true. So to supper, and there my\nLord the kindest man to me before all the table, talking of me to my\nadvantage, and with tenderness too, that it overjoyed me. So after\nsupper Capt. Cocke and I and Temple on board the Bezan, and\nthere to Cards for a while, and then to read again in Rhodes and so to\nsleep. But Lord, the mirth which it caused to me to be waked in the\nnight by their Snoaring round about me —I did laugh till Iwas ready\nto burst, and waked one of the two companions of Temple, who\ncould not a good while tell where he was, that he heard one laugh\nso, till he recollected himself and I told him what it was at; and so to\nsleep again, they still Snoaring."

Up, and after being trimmed, by boate to the\nCockepitt, where I heard the Duke of Albemarle’s chaplain make a\nsimple sermon. Among other things, reproaching the imperfec-\ntion of humane learning, he cried — ‘‘All our physicians can’t tell\nwhat an ague is, and all our Arithmetique is not able to number\nthe days of a man” — which, God knows, is not the fault of\narithmetique, but that our understandings reach not that thing. To\ndinner, where a great deal of silly discourse. But the worst is, I\nhear that the plague encreases much at Lambeth, St. Martins, and\nWestminster, and fear it will all over the City. Thence I to the\nSwan, there thinking to have seen Sarah, but she was at church;\nand so by water to Deptford, and there made a visit to Mr.\nEvelings, who, among other things, showed me most excellent\npainting in little — in distemper, Indian Incke — water colours —\ngraveing; and above all, the whole secret of Mezzo Tinto and the\nmanner of it, which is very pretty, and good things done with it.\nHe read to me very much also of his discourse he hath been many\nyears and now is about, about Guardenage; which will be a most\nnoble and pleasant piece. He read me part of a play or two of his\nmaking, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be. He\nshowed me his Hortus hyemalis; leaves laid up in a book of several\nplants, kept dry, which preserve Colour however, and look very\nfinely, better than any herball. In fine, a most excellent person he\nis, and must be allowedalittle for a little conceitedness; but he\nmay well be so, being a man so much above others. He read me,\nthough with too much gusto, some little poems of his own, that\nwere not transcendent, yet one or two very pretty Epigrams:\namong others, of a lady looking in at a grate and being pecked at\nby an Eagle that was there. Here comes in in the middle of our\ndiscourse, Capt. Cocke, as drunk as a dog, but could stand and\ntalk and laugh. He didsojoy himself in a brave woman that he had\nbeen with all the afternoon, and who should it be but my Lady\nRobinson. But very troublesome he is with his noise and talk and\nlaughing, though very pleasant. With him in his coach to Mr.\nGlanvills, where he sat with Mrs. Penington and myself a good\nwhile, talking of this fine woman again, and then went away.\nThen the lady and I to very serious discourse; and among other\nthings, of what a bonny lass my Lady Robinson is, who is\nreported to be kind to the prisoners, and hath said to Sir G. Smith,\nwho is her great Chrony: “Look, there is a pretty man; I could be\ncontented to break a commandment with him” — and such loose\nSSI\nexpressions she will have often. After an hour’s talk, we to bed —\nthe lady mightily troubled about a little pretty bitch she hath,\nwhich is very sick and will eat nothing. And the jest was, I could\nhear her in her chamber bemoaning the bitch; and by and by\ntaking her to bed with her, the bitch pissed and shit abed, and she\nwas fain to rise and had coals out of my chamber to dry the bed\nagain.

As an infinite\nsecret, my Lord tells me the factions are high between the King and\nthe Duke, and all the Court are in an uproare with their loose\namours — the Duke of York being in love desperately with Mrs.\nStewart. Nay, that the Duchesse herself is fallen in love with her\nnew Maister of the Horse, one Harry Sidny, and another Harry\nSavill — so that God knows what will be the end of it.

I heard this day that Mr. Harrington is not dead of the\nplague as we believed; at which I was very glad — but most of all to\nhear that the plague is come very low; that is, the whole under 1000\nand the plague 600 and odd — and great hopes of a further decrease,\nbecause of this day’s being a very exceeding hard frost — and\ncontinues freezing. This day the first of the Oxford Gazettes came\nout, which is very pretty, full of news, and no folly in it — wrote by\nWilliamson. From the Change, which is pretty full again, I to my\nhouse and there took some things, and so by water to my lodging at\nGreenwich and dined; and then to the office a while and at night\nhome to my lodgings, and took T.

This done, I late to bed. Among\nother things, it pleased me to have it demonstrated that a purser\nwithout professed cheating is a professed loser, twice as much as he\ngets."

And so told\nhim of my late business of the victualling and what cares I am in to\nkeep myself, having to do with people of so different factions at\nCourt, and yet must be fair with them all- which was very pleasant\ndiscourse for me to tell, as well, as he seemed to take it, for him to\nhear. At last up, and it being a very foul day for rain and a hideous\nwind, yet having promised I would go, by water to Erith — and\nbearing sail, was in danger of oversetting — but made them take\ndown their sail; and so, cold and wet, got thither as they had ended\ntheir dinner.

I had great\nsatisfaction herein; so home, and to my papers for lack of company,\nbut by and by comes little Mrs. Tooker and sat and supped with\nme, and Ikept her very late, talking and making her comb my head;\nand did what I will with her et tena grande plaisir con ella, tocando\nsa cosa con mi cosa, and hazendo la cosa par cette moyen.

He tells me of new difficulties about his\ngoods, which troubles me andI fear they will be great.

But I do fear those two families, his and my Lord\nSandwiches, are quite broken—and I must now stand upon my own\nlegs. Thence to my lodging; and considering how Iam hindered by\ncompany there to do anything among my papers, Idid resolve to go\naway today, rather then stay to no purpose till tomorrow; and so\ngot all my things packed up — and spent half an hour with W. How\nabout his papers of accounts for contingencies and my Lord’s\naccounts, and so took leave of my landlady and daughters, having\npaid dear for what time I have spent there; but yet, having been\nquiet and in health, Iam very well contented therewith. So with my\nwife and Mercer took boat, and away home. But in the evening,\nbefore Iwent, comes Mrs. Knipp just to speak with me privately, to\nexcuse her not coming to me yesterday, complaining how like a\ndevil her husband treats her, but will be with us in town a week\nhence; and so I kissed her and parted. Being come home, my wife\nand I to look over our house, and consider laying out a little money\nto hang our bedchamber better then it is; and so resolved to go and\nbuy something tomorrow; and so after supper, with great joy in my\nheart for my coming once again hither, to bed."

At noon home to dinner, where Uncle\nTho. with me, and in comes Pierce, lately come from Oxford, and\nFerrers. After dinner Pierce and I up to my chamber, where he tells\nme how a great difference hath been between the Duke and\nDuchesse, he suspecting her to be naught with Mr. Sidny — but\n$70\nsome way or other the matter is made up; but he was banished the\nCourt, and the Duke for many days did not speak to the Duchesse at\nall. He tells me that my Lord Sandwich is lost there at Court,\nthough the King is perticularly his friend. But people do speak\neverywhere slightly of him. Which isa sad story to me, but Ihope it\nmay be better again. And that Sir G. Carteret is neglected, and hath\ngreat enemies at work against him. That matters must needs go bad\nwhile all the town and every boy in the street openly cries the King\ncannot go away till my Lady Castlemayne be ready to come along\nwith him, she being lately brought to bed. And that he visits her and\nMrs. Stewart every morning before he eats his breakfast. All this\nput together makes me very sad; but yet Ihope Ishall do pretty well\namong them for all this, by my not meddling with either of their\nmatters. And then comes Mr. Gawden, and he and I talked above-\nstairs together a good while about his business; and to my great joy,\ngot him to declare that of the sool he did give me the other day,\nnone of it was for my Treasurershipp for Tanger — (I first telling\nhim how matters stood between Povy and I, that he was to have\nhalf of whatever was coming to me by that office); and that he will\ngratify me at two per cent for that when he next receives any money\n—so there is 80/ due to me more then I thought of. He gone, I witha\nglad heart to the office to write my letters; and so home to supper\nand bed. My wife mighty full of her work she hath today in\nfurnishing her bedchamber.\nto. Up, and by coach to Sir G. Downing, where Mr. Gawden\nmet me by agreement to talk upon the Act. I do find Sir G.\nDowning to be a mighty talker, more then is true; which I now\nknow to be so, and suspected it before; but for all that, Ihave good\ngrounds to think it will succeed for goods, and in time for money\ntoo; but not presently. Having done with him, I to my Lord\nBrunckers house in Covent Guarden; and among other things, it\nwas to acquaint him with my paper of pursers; and read it to him\nand had his good liking of it. Showed him Mr. Coventry’s sense of\nit, which he sent me last post, much to my satisfaction. Thence to\nthe Change, and there hear, to our grief, how the plague is\nencreased this week from 70 to 89. We have also great fear of our\nHambrough fleet, of their meeting the Dutch; as also have certain\nnews that by storms Sir Jer. Smith’s fleet is scattered, and three of\nthem come without masts back to Plymouth; which is another very\nexceeding great disappointment, and if the victualling ships are\nS71\nmiscarried, will tend to the loss of the garrison of Tanger. Thence\nhome; in my way, had the opportunity I longed for, of seeing and\nsaluting Mrs. Stokes, my little goldsmiths wife in Paternoster row;\nand there bespoke something, a silver chafing-dish for warming\nplates. And so home to dinner. Found my wife busy about making\nher hangings for her chamber with the Upholster. SoI to the office,\nand anon to the Duke of Albemarle by coach at night (taking, for\nsaving time, Sir W. Warren with me, talking of our businesses all\nthe way going and coming) and there got his reference of my\npursers’ paper to the Board, to consider ofitbefore he read it, for he\nwill never understand it I am sure. Here I saw Sir W. Coventry’s\nkind letter to him concerning my paper. And among other of his\nletters (which I see all, and that is a strange thing, that whatever 1s\nwrit to this Duke of Albemarle, all the world may see; for this very\nnight he did give me Mr. Coventry’s letter to read as soon as it came\nto his hand, before he had read it himself, and bid me take out of it\nwhat concerned the Navy; and many things there was in it which I\nshould not have thought fit for him to have let anybody so suddenly\nsee). But among other things, find him profess himself to the Duke\na friend into the enquiring further into the business of Prizes,’ and\nadvises that it may be public, for the righting the King and\nsatisfying the people and getting the blame to be rightly laid where\nit should be — which strikes very hard upon my Lord Sandwich —\nand troubles me to read it. Besides, what vexed me more, I heard\nthe damned Duchesse again say,”\nto twenty gentlemen publicly in\nthe room, that she would have Mountagu sent once more to sea,\nbefore he goes his Embassy, that we may see whether he will make\namends for his cowardize, and repeated the answer she did give the\nother day in my hearing to Sir G. Downing — wishing her Lord had\nbeen a coward, for then perhaps he might have been made an\nEmbassador and not been sent now to sea. But one good thing she\nsaid — she cried mightily out against the having of gentlemen\nCaptains with feathers and ribbands, and wished the King would\nsend her husband to sea with the old plain sea-Captains that he\nserved with formerly, that would make their ships swim with\nblood, though they could not make legs as captains nowadays can."

But he did detect, endeed, a failure or two\nof mine in my report about the ill condition of the present pursers,\nwhich I did magnify in one or two little things; to which I think he\ndid with reason except. But at last, with all respect did declare the\nbest thing he ever heard of this kind; but when Sir W.

Penn and I, and see what we can do to mend\nall,”’ he was so far from offering or furthering it, that he declined it\nand said he must be out of town. So, as I ever knew him, never did\nin his life ever attempt to mend anything, but suffer all things to go\non in the way they are, though never so bad, rather then improve\nhis experience to the King’s advantage. So we broke up; however,\nthey promising to meet to offer something in it of their opinions —\nand so we ris; and I and my Lord Brouncker by coachalittle way, I\nwith him for discourse sake — till our coach broke and tumbled me\nover him quite down the side of the coach, falling on the ground\nabout the Stockes. But up again, and thinking it fit to have for my\nhonour something reported in writing to the Duke in favour of my\npains in this, lest it should be thought to be rejected as Frivolous, I\nS73\ndid move it to my Lord, and he will see it done tomorrow. So we\nparted; andI to the office, and thence home to my poor wife, who\nworks all day at home like a horse at the making of her hangings for\nour chamber and the bed. So to supper and to bed."

Cocke’s good company,\nand the acquaintance of Mrs. Knipp, Coleman and her husband,\nand Mr. Laneare; and great store of dancings we have had at my cost\n(which I was willing to indulge myself and wife) at my lodgings.\nThe great evil of this year, and the only one endeed, is the fall of my\nLord of Sandwich, whose mistake about the Prizes hath undone\nhim, I believe, as to interest at Court; though sent (for a little\npalliateing it) Imbassador into Spayne, which he is now fitting\nhimself for. But the Duke of Albemarle goes with the Prince to sea\nthis next year, and my Lord very meanly spoken of; and endeed, his\nmiscarriage about the prize goods is not to be excused, to suffer a\ncompany of rogues to go away with ten times as much as himself,\nand the blame of all to be deservedly laid upon him. My whole\nfamily hath been well all this while, and all my friends I know of,\nsaving my aunt Bell, who is dead, and some children of my Cosen\nSarah’s, of the plague. But many of such as I know very well, dead.\n565\n1665 31 December\nYet to our great joy, the town fills apace, and shops begin to be\nopen again. Pray God continue the plague’s decrease — for that\nkeeps the Court away from the place of business, and so all goes to\nwrack as to public matters, they at this distance not thinking of it.\n566\nah\n-eeey\nge 1666\nEby\nTha\n~%&\nJANUARY #-\n1. New yeare’s Day. Called up by 5 a-clock by my order by Mr.\nTooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of the\nPursers, and so without eating or drinking till 3 in the afternoon,\nand then to my great content finished it. So to dinner, Gibson and\nhe and I — and then to Copying it over, Mr. Gibson reading and |\nwriting, and went a good way in it till interrupted by Sir W.\nWarren’s coming, of whom I alway learn something or other, his\ndiscourse being very good, and his brains also. He being gone, we\nto our business again, and wrote more of it fair; and then late to bed.\n2. Up by candlelight again, and wrote the greatest part of my\nbusiness fair; and then to the office, and so home to dinner, and\nafter dinner up and made an end of my fair-writing it. And that\nbeing done, set [?my clerks] to entering, while I to my Lord\nBruncker’s; and there find Sir\nJ.Mennes and all his company, and\nMr. Boreman and Mrs. Turner, but above all, my dear Mrs.\nKnipp, with whomI sang; and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her\nsing, and especially her little Scotch song of Barbary Allen. And to\nmake our mirth the completer, Sir Jo. Minnes was in the highest\npitch of mirth, and his Mimicall tricks, that ever I saw; and most\nexcellent pleasant company he is, and the best Mimique that ever I\nsaw, and certainly would have made an excellent Actor, and now\nwould be an excellent teacher of Actors. Thence, it being post-\nnight, against my will took leave; but before I came to my office,\nlonging for more ef her company, returned and met them coming\nhome in coaches; so I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was,\nand got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with\nher breasts and sung; and at last set her at her house, and so good-\nnight. So home to my lodgings, and there endeavoured to have\nfinished the examining my paper of Pursers business to have sent\naway tonight; but I was so sleepy with my late early risings and\nlate goings to bed, that I could not do it, but was forced to go to\n$67\nbed and leave it to send away tomorrow by an Expresse."

So I supped, and was merry at home all\nthe evening, and the rather it being my Birthday, 33 years — for\nwhich God be praised that I am in so good a condition of health and\nstate and everything else as I am, beyond expectation in all. So she\nto Mrs. Turner’s to lie, and we to bed — mightily pleased to find\nmyself in condition to have these people come about me, and to be\nable to entertain them and have the pleasure of their qualities, then\nwhich no man can have more in this world.\n25. Lords day. My wife up between 3 and 4 of the clock in the\nmorning to dress herself, and I about 5, and were all ready to take\ncoach, she and I and Mercer a little past 5; but to our trouble, the\ncoach did not come till 6. Then, with our coach offour horses I hire\non purpose, and Lashmore to ride by, we through the City, it being\nclear day, to Branford, and so to Windsor (Capt. Ferrer overtaking\nus at Kensington, being to go with us) and here drank; and so\nthrough, making no stay, to Cranborne about 11 a-clock, and\nfound my Lord and the ladies at a sermon in the house — which\nbeing ended, we to them; and all the company glad to see us, and\nmighty merry to dinner. Here was my Lord, and Lord Hinch-\ningbrooke and Mr. Sidny — Sir Ch. Herbert and Mr. Carteret — my\nLady Carteret, my Lady Jemimah, and Lady Slaning. After dinner\nto talk to and again, and then to walk in the Parke, my Lord and I\nalone, talking upon these heads —\nfirst, he hath left his business of\nthe prizes as well as is possible for him, having cleared himself\nbefore the Commissioners by the King’s commands, so that\nnothing or little is to be feared from that point — he goes fully\nassured, he tells me, of the King’s favour. That upon occasion Imay\nknow, I desired to know his friends I may trust to. He tells me, but\nthat he is not yet in England but continues this summer in Ireland,\n589\n1666 25 February\nmy Lord Orrery is his father almost in affection. He tells me, my\nLord of Suffolke — Lord Arlington — Archbishop of Canterbury —\nLord Treasurer— Mr. Atturny Mountagu — (Sir Tho. Clifford in the\nHouse of Commons), Sir G. Carteret, and some others I cannot\npresently remember, are friends that I may rely on for him. He tells\nme my Lord Chancellor seems his very good friend, but doubts that\nhe may not think him as mucha servant of the Duke of York’s as he\nwould have him; and endeed my Lord tells me he hath lately made it\nhis business to be seen studious of the King’s favour, and not of the\nDuke’s, and by the King will stand or fall — for factions there are, as\nhe tells me, and God knows how high they may come. The Duke of\nAlbemarles post is so great, having had the name of bringing in the\nKing, that he is like to stand; or, if it were not for him, God knows\nin what troubles we might be from some private factions, if an\narmy could be got into another hand, which God forbid. It is\nbelieved that though Mr. Coventry be in appearance so great\nagainst the Chancellor, yet that there is a good understanding\nbetween the Duke’ and him. He dreads the issue of this year, and\nfears there will be some very great revolutions* before his coming\nback again. He doubts it is needful for him to have a pardon for his\nlast year’s action,’ all which he did without commission, and at\nmost but the King’s private single word for that of Bergen; but he\ndares not ask it at this time, lest it should make them think that there\nis something more in it then yet they know; and if it should be\ndenied, it would be of very ill consequence. He says also, ifit should\nin Parliament be enquired into, the selling of Dunkirke (though the\nChancellor was the man that would have it sold to France, saying\nthe King of Spain had no money to give for it), yet he will be found\nto have been the greatest adviser of it — which he isa little\napprehensive may be called upon this Parliament. He told me it\nwould not be necessary for him to tell me his debts, because he\nthinks I know them so well. The Duke hath for this week or two\nbeen very kind to him, more then lately, and so others; which he\nthinks is a good sign of fair weather again. He says the Archbishop\nof Canterbury hath been very kind to him, and hath plainly said to\nhim that he and all the world knows the difference between his\njudgment and brains and the Duke of Albema[r]les — and then calls\nmy Lady Duchess the veriest slut and drudge, and the foulest word\n1.

And hither comes cushions to us,\nand a young singing-boy to bring us a copy of the Anthemne to be\nsung. And here, for our sakes, had this anthem and the great service\nsung extraordinary, only to entertain us. It is a noble place endeed,\nand good Quire ofvoices. Great bowing by all the people, the poor\nKnights perticularly, to the Alter. After prayers, we to see the plate\nS91\nof the Chapel and the Robes of Knights, and a man to show us the\nbanners of the several Knights in being, which hang up over the\nstalls.

But Lord, the prospect\nthat is in the Balcone in the Queen’s lodgings, and the Tarrace and\nwalk, are strange things to consider, being the best in the world,\nsure. Infinitely satisfied, I and my wife with all this; she being in all\npoints mightily pleased too, which added to my pleasure. And so\ngiving a great deal of money to this and that man and woman, we to\nour tavern and there dined, the Doctor with us; and so took coach\nand away to Eaton, the Doctor with me. At Eaton I left my wife in\nthe coach, and he andI to the college and there find all mighty fine.\nThe school good, and the custom pretty of boys cutting their names\nin the shuts of the window when they go to Cambrige; by which\nmany a one hath lived to see himself Provost and Fellow, that had\nhis name in the window standing. To the hall, and there find the\nboys’ verses, De peste; it being their custom to make verses at\nShrovetide. I read several, and very good they were, and better |\nthink then ever I made when I was a boy — and in rolls as long and\nlonger then the whole hall by much. Here is a picture of Venice\nhung up, given, anda Monument made of Sir H. Wottons giving it,\nto the College. Thence to the Porters, in the absence of the Butler,\nand did drink of the College beer, which is very good, and went\ninto the back fields to see the scholars play. Thence took leave of the\nDoctor; and so took coach, and finely, but sleepy, away home, and\ngot thither about 8 at night; and after a little at my office, I to bed.\nAnd an hour after was waked with my wife’s quarrelling with\nMercer, at which I was angry, and my wife andIfell out — but with\nmuch ado to sleep again, I beginning to practise more temper, and\nto give her her way."

Up, and after doing a little business at my\noffice, I walked (it being a most curious dry and cold morning) to\nWhitehall; and there I went into the parke, and meeting Sir Ph.\nWarwicke, took a turn with him in the Pell Mell, talking of the\nmelancholy posture of affairs, where everybody is snarling one at\nanother, and all things put together look ominously. This new\nAct,’ too, putting us out ofa power of raising money — so that he\nfears as I do, but is fearful of enlarging in that discourse ofa whole\nconfusion in everything, and the State and all. We appointed\nanother time to meet to talk of the business of the Navy alone,\nseriously, and so parted and I to Whitehall; and there we did our\nbusiness with the Duke of Yorke, and so parted and walked to\nWestminster hall, where I stayed talking with Mrs. Michell and\nHowlett long, and her daughter, which is become a mighty pretty\nwoman; and thence, going out of the hall, was called to by Mrs.\nMartin. So I went to her, and bought two bands and so parted, and\nby and by met at her chamber and there did what I would; and so\naway home, and there find Mrs. Knipp and we dined together, she\nthe pleasantest company in the world. After dinner I did give my\nwife money to lay out on Knipp, 20s., and I abroad to Whitehall to\nvisit Coll. Norwood and then Sir G. Carteret, with whom I have\nbrought myself right again, and he very open to me. Is very\nmelancholy, and matters, I fear, go down with him; but he seems\nmost afeared of a general catastrophe to the whole Kingdom, and\nthinks, as I fear, that all things will come to nothing. Thence to the\nPalace yard to the Swan and there stayed till it was dark; and then to\nMrs. Lanes and there lent her $/, upon 4/ ors. in gold — and then did\nwhat I would with her; and Iperceive she is come to be very bad and\noffers anything, that it is dangerous to have to do with her; nor will\nI see any more a good while. Thence by coach home and to the\noffice, where a while; and then betimes to bed, by 10 a-clock,\nsooner then I have done many a day.

The ‘Additional Aid’.\n$93\n1666 28 February—2 March\nsetting backward of my business, that I cannot give a good account\nof it as I ought to do.\n—%*MARCH#-\n1. Up, and to the office and there all the morning sitting; and at\nnoon to dinner with my Lord Brouncker, Sir W. Batten, and Sir W.\nPenn at the White Horse in Lumbard street — where, God forgive\nus, good sport with Capt. Cockes having his maid sick of the\nplague a day or two ago, and sent to the pest-house, where she now\nis — but he will not say anything but that she is well. But, blessed be\nGod, a good Bill this week we have — being but 237 in all, and 42 of\nthe plague, and of them, but 6 in the City — though my Lord\nBrouncker says that these 6 are most of them in new parishes,\nwhere they were not the last week. Here was with us also Mr.\nWilliamson, who the more I know, the more I honour. Thence I\nslipped after dinner without notice home, and there close to my\nbusiness at my office till 12 at night, having with great comfort\nreturned to my business by some fresh vows, in addition to my\nformer and more severe; and a great joy it is to me to see myself ina\ngood disposition to business.

At noon dined,\nand to the office again; and 2bout 4 a-clock took coach and to my\nLord Treasurer’s, and thence to Sir Ph. Warwicke’s new house by\nappointment, there to spend an hour in talking; and we were\ntogether above an hour, and very good discourse about the state of\nthe King as to money, and perticularly, in that point, of the Navy.\nHe endeavours hard to come to a good understanding of Sir. G.\nCarteret’s accounts. And by his discourse, I find Sir G. Carteret\nmust be brought to it, and he is a madman that he doth not do it of\nhimself, for the King expects the Parliament will call upon him for\nhis promise of giving an account of the money, and he will be ready\n$94\nfor it, which cannot be, I am sure, without Sir G. Carteret’s\naccounts be better understood then they are. Thence by coach,\ncalling at my bookseller’s, and carried home 1o/-worth of books, all\n[hopeI shall buy a great while. There by appointment find Mr. Hill\ncome to sup and take his last leave of me;\" and by and by in comes\nMr. James Houbland to bear us company, a man I love mightily,\nand will not lose his acquaintance. He told me in my eare this night\nwhat he and his brothers have resolved to give me, which is 200! for\nhelping them out with two or three ships — a good sum, and that\nwhich I did believe they would give me, and I did expect little less.\nHere we talked, and very good company till late, and then took\nleave of one another; and endeed I am heartily sorry for Mr. Hill’s\nleaving us — for he is a very worthy gentleman, as most I know —\nGod give him a good voyage and success in his business.

Lords day. Up and abroad, and by coach to Charing cross to\nwait on Sir Ph. Howard— whom I found in bed, and he doth receive\nme very civilly. My request was about suffering my wife’s brother\nto go to sea, and to save his pay in the Duke’s guards — which, after a\nlittle difficulty, he did with great respect agree to. I find him a very\nfine-spoken gentleman, and one of great parts — and very cour-\nteous. Much pleased with this visit, I to Whitehall, where I met Sir\nG. Downing; and to discourse with him an hour about the\nExchequer payments upon the late act, and informed myself of him\nthoroughly in my safety in lending 2000! to Sir W. Warren upon an\norder of his upon the Exchequer for 2602! — and I do purpose to do\nit. Thence, meeting Dr. Allen the physician, he and I and another\nwalked in the park, a most pleasant warm day, and to the Queen’s\nchapel — where I do not so dislike the music. Here I saw ona post an\ninvitation to all good Catholics to pray for the soul of such a one,\ndeparted this life.\n6. Up mighty betimes, upon my wife’s going this day toward\nBrampton. I could not go to the coach with her, but W. Hewers\ndid, and hath leave from me to go the whole day’s journey with her.\nAll the morning upon business at the office, and at noon dined; and\nMrs. Hunt coming, lent her s/ on her occasions, and so carried her\nto axe yard end at Westminster and there left her — a good and\nunderstanding woman, and her husband, I perceive, thrives\nmightily in his business of the Excise. Thence to Mr. Hales, and\nthere sat and my picture almost finished; which, by the word of Mr.\n603\nand Mrs. Pierce (who came in accidentally), is mighty like, and] am\nsure I am mightily pleased, both in the thing and the posture.\nThence with them homealittle, and so to Whitehall and there met\nby agreement with Sir St. Fox and Mr. Ashburnham, and\ndiscoursed the business of our Excize tallies — the former being\nTreasurer of the guards, and the other Cofferer of the King’s\nhousehold — I benefited much by their discourse. We came to no\ngreat conclusion upon our discourse; but parted, and Ihome, where\nall things methinks melancholy in the absence of my wife. This day\ngreat news of the Swedes declaring for us against the Dutch; and so\nfar as that, I believe it.’ After a little supper, to bed."

Thence by water to Redriffe, reading a\nnew French book my Lord Brouncker did give me today, L’histoire\namoureuse des Gaules, being a pretty Libell against the amours of the\nCourt of France. I walked up and down Deptford yard, where Ihad\nnot been since I came from living at Greenwich — which is some\nmonths. There I met with Mr. Castle and was forced against my\nwill to have his company back with me. So we walked and drank at\nthe Halfway house, and so to his house, where I drank a cup of\nSyder; and so home — where I find Mr. Norbury, newly come to\ntown, come to see us. After he gone, my wife tells me the ill News\nthat our Su is sick, and gone to bed with great pain in her head and\nback — which troubles us all. However, we to bed, expecting what\ntomorrow would produce. She hath, we conceive, wrought a\nlittle\ntoo much, having neither maid nor girl to help her.\n2.

Elliott of the Portland, which, by being run on\nboard by the Guernsey, was disabled from staying abroad — so is\ncoming in to Albrough. That he saw one of the Duch great ships\n623\n1666 3 June\nblown up, and three on fire. That they begun to fight on Friday.\nAnd at his coming into port, could make another ship of the King’s\ncoming in, which he judged to be the Rupert. That he knows of no\nother hurt to our ships. With this good news, I home by water\nagain, and to church in the sermon time and with great joy told it\nmy fellows in the pew. So home after church-time to dinner. And\nafter dinner my father, wife, sister, and Mercer by water to\nWoolwich, while I walked by land and saw the Exchange as full of\npeopie, and hath been all this noon, as of any other day, only for\nnews. A letter is also come this afternoon from Harman in the\nHenery (which is she was taken by Elliott for the Rupert), that being\nfallen into the body of the Duch fleet, he made his way through\nthem, was set on by three fireships, one after another — got two of\nthem off and disabled the third— was set on fire himself; upon which\nmany of his men leaped into the sea and perished; among others, the\nParson first — hath lost above 100 men and a good many wounded\n(God knows what is become of Balty); and at last quenched his own\nfire and got to Albrough — being, as all say, the greatest hazard that\never any ship scaped, and as bravely managed by him. The mast of\nthe third fireship fell into their ship on Fire and hurt Harman’s leg,\nwhich makes him lame now, but not dangerous. I to Sir G.\nCarteret, who told me there hath been great bad management in all\nthis; that the King’s orders that went on Friday for calling back the\nPrince, was sent but by the ordinary post on Wednesdy, and came\nto the Prince his hands but on Friday. And then instead of sailing\npresently, he stays till 4 in the evening; and that which is worst of all\n— the Hampshire, laden with merchants money come from the\nStreights, set out with or but just before the fleet and was in the\nDownes by 5 of the clock yesterday morning — and the Prince with\nhis fleet came over to Dover but at 10 of the clock at night. This is\nhard to [be] answered, if it be true. This puts great astonishment\ninto the King and Duke and Court, everybody being out of\ncountenance. So meeting Creed, he and I by coach to Hide parke\nalone to talk of these things, and do bless God that my Lord\nSandwich was not here at this time — to be concerned in a business\nlike to be so misfortunate. It was a pleasant thing to consider how\nfearful I was of being seen with Creed all this afternoon, for fear of\npeople’s thinking that by our relation to my Lord Sandwich we\nshould be making ill constructions of the Prince’s failure. But God\nknows, I am heartily sorry, for the sake of the whole nation; though\nif it were not for that, it would not be amisse to have these high\n624\nblades find some check to their presumption — and their disparaging\nof so good men. Thence set him down in Common Guarden, and\nso home by the Change; which is full of people still, and all talk\nhighly of the failure of the Prince in not making more haste after his\ninstructions did come, and of our managements herein, not giving\nit sooner and with more care and oftener thence.

So walking through the\npark, we saw hundreds of people listening at the Gravell pits, and to\nand again in the park to hear the guns. And I sawaletter, dated last\nnight, from Strowd, Governor of Dover Castle, which says that the\nPrince came thither the night before with his fleet. But that for the\nguns which we writ that we heard, it is only a mistake for Thunder;\nand so far as to yesterday, it is a miraculous thing that we all Friday\nand Saturday and yesterday did hear everywhere most plainly the\nguns go off, and yet at Deale and Dover, to last night, they did not\nhear one word ofa\nfight, nor think they heard one gun. This, added\nto what I have set down before the other day about the Katharine,\nmakes room fora great dispute in Philosophy: how we should hear\nit and not they, the same wind that brought it to us being the same\nthat should bring it to them. But so it is. After Wayting upon the\nDuke, Sir W. Penn (who was commanded to go to rights by water\ndown to Harwich to despatch away all the ships he can) and Ihome,\ndrinking two bottles of Cocke ale in the street, in his new fine\ncoach, and so home — where no sooner come, but news is brought\nme of\na couple of men come to speak with me from the fleet. So I\ndown, and who should it be but Mr. Daniel, all muffled up, and his.\nface as black as the chimney and covered with dirt, pitch and tar,\nand powder, and muffled with dirty clouts and his right eye stopped\nwith Okum. He is come last night at 5 a-clock from the fleet, witha\ncomrade of his that hath endangered another eye. They were set on\nshore at Harwich this morning at 2 a-clock in a ketch, with about\ntwenty more wounded men from the Royal Charles. They being\nable to ride, took post about 3 this morning and was here between\n11 and 12. I went presently into the coach with them, and carried\nthem to Sumersett house stairs and there took water (all the world\ngazing upon us and concluding it to be news from the fleet; and\neverybody’s face appeared expecting of news) to the Privy stairs\n625\n1666 4 June\nand left them at Mr. Coventry’s lodging (he, though, not being\nthere); and so I into the park to the King, and told him my Lord\nGenerall was well the last night at 5 o’clock, and the Prince come\nwith his fleet and joyned with his about 7. The King was mightily\npleased with this news and so took me by the hand and talkeda\nlittle\nof it—I giving him the best account Icould; and then he bid me fetch\nthe two seamen to him — he walking into the house. So I went and\nfetched the seamen into the Vane-room to him, and there he heard\nthe whole account.\nThe Fight'\nHow we found the Duch fleet at anchor on Friday, half-seas-\nover, between Dunkirke and Oastend, and made them let slip their\nAnchors — they about 90, and we less then 60. We fought them and\nput them to the run, till they met with about 16 sail of fresh ships\nand so bore up again. The fight continued till night, and then again\nthe next morning from ¢ till 7 at night — and so too, yesterday\nmorning they begun again, and continued till about 4 a-clock — they\nchasing us for the most part of Saturday and yesterday; we fleeing\nfrom them. The Duke himself, then those people, were put into the\nketch, and by and by spied the Prince’s fleet coming — upon which,\nDe Ruyter called a little council (being in chase at this time of us);\nand thereupon their fleet divided into two squadrons, 40 in one and\nabout 30 in the other (the fleet being at first about 90, but by one\naccident or other supposed to be lessened to about 70); the bigger to\nfallow the Duke, the less to meet the Prince. But the Prince came up\nwith the Generalls fleet, and the Dutch came together again and\nbore toward their own coast — and we with them. And now, what\nthe consequence of this day will be, that we [hear] them fighting,\nwe know not. The Duke was forced to come to Anchor on Friday,\nhaving lost his sails and rigging. No perticular person spoken of to\nbe hurt but Sir W. Clerke, who hath lost his leg, and bore it bravely.\nThe Duke himself had a little hurt in his thigh, but signified little.\nThe King did pull out of his pocket about twenty pieces in gold, and\ndid give it Daniel for himself and his companion. And so parted,\nmightily pleased with the account he did give him of the fight and\nthe success it ended with — of the Prince’s coming — though it seems\nthe Duke did give way again and again. The King did give order for\ncare to be had of Mr. Daniel and his companion; and so we parted\n1. The Four Days Battle, 1-4 June.\n626\nfrom him, and then met the Duke and gave him the same account;\nand so broke up, andI left them going to the surgeon’s; and I myself\nby water to the Change, and to several people did give account of\nthe business; and so home about 4 a-clock to dinner and was\nfallowed by several people home, to be told the news, and good\nnews it is.\nFresh letters are come from Harwich — where the Glocester, Capt.\nClerke, is come in. And says that on Sunday night, upon coming in\nof the Prince, the Duch did fly. But all this day they have been\nfighting; therefore, they did face again, to be sure. Capt. Bacon of\nthe Bristoll is killed. They cry up Jenings of the Ruby and Saunders\nof the Sweepstakes. They condemn mightily Sir Tho. Teddiman for\na Coward, but with what reason, time must show. Having heard all\nthis, Creed and I walked into the park till 9 or 10 at night, it being\nfine moonshine — discoursing of the unhappiness of our fleet. What\nit would have been if the Prince had not come in. How much the\nDuke hath failed of what he was so presumptuous of. How little we\ndeserve of God Almighty to give us better fortune. How much this\nexcuse[s] all that was imputed to my Lord Sandwich; and how\nmuch more he is a man fit to be trusted with all these matters then\nthese that now command, who act by nor with any advice, but\nrashly and without any order. How bad we are at intelligence, that\nshould give the Prince no sooner notice of anything, but let him\ncome to Dover without notice of any fight, or where the fleet were,\nor anything else; nor give the Duke any notice that he might depend\nupon the Prince’s reserve. And lastly, of how good use all may be to\ncheck our pride and presumption in adventuring upon hazards\nupon unequal force, against a people that can fight, it seems now, as\nwell as we, and that will not be discouraged by any losses, but that\nthey will rise again. Thence by water home, and to supper (my\nfather, wife, and sister having been at Islington today at Pitts’s) and\nto bed."

On this occasion the Queene, in ordinary talk before the ladies\nin her drawing-room, did say to my Lady Castlemayne that she\nfeared the King did take cold by staying so late abroad at her house.\nShe answered, before them all, that he did not stay so late abroad\nwith her, for he went betimes thence (though he doth not before 1,\n2, or 3 in the morning), but must stay somewhere else. The King\nthen coming in, and overhearing, did whisper in the eare aside and\ntold her she was a bold impertinent woman, and bid her be gone out\nof the Court arid not come again till he sent for her — which she did\npresently; and went to a lodging in the Pell mell and kept there two\nor three days, and then sent to the King to know whether she might\nsend for her things away out of her house; the King sent to her, she\nmust first come and view them; and so she came, and the King went\n629\nto her and all friends again.

Here I find my father’s\npicture begun; and so much to my content, that it joys my very\nheart to think that I should have his picture so well done — who,\nbesides that he is my father, and a man that loves me and hath ever\ndone so —is also at this day one of the most careful and innocent men\nin the world. Thence with mighty content homeward; and in my\nway, at the Stockes, did buy a couple of lobsters, and so home to\ndinner. Where I find my wife and father had dined, and were going\nout to Hales’s to sit there. So Balty and I alone to dinner; and in the\nmiddle of my grace, praying for a blessing upon (these his good\ncreatures), my mind fell upon my Lobsters — upon whichIcried,\n“Cuds zookes!”” And Balty looked upon me like a man at a loss\nwhat I meant, thinking at first that I meant only that I had said the\ngrace after meat, instead of that before meat; but then I cried, ‘“‘What\nis become of my lobsters?”’, whereupon he run out of doors to\novertake the coach, but could not, and so came back again, and\nmighty merry at dinner to think of my Surprize. After dinner to the\nExcize office by appointment, thence home, and put off Balty; and\nso (being invited) to Sir Chr. Mings’s Funerall, but find them gone\nto church. However, I into the church (which is a fair large church,\nand a great Chappell), and there heard the service and stayed till\nthey buried him, and then out. And there met with Sir W.\nCoventry (who was there out of great generosity, and no person of\nquality there but he) and went with him into his Coach; and being in\nit with him, there happened this extraordinary case — one of the\nmost Romantique that ever Iheard of in my life, and could not have\nbelieved but that I did see it — which was this.\nAbout a Dozen able, lusty, proper men came to the coach-side\nwith tears in their eyes, and one of them, that spoke for the rest,\nbegun and says to Sir W. Coventry — “We are here a Dozen of us\nthat have long known and loved and served our dead commander,\nSir Chr. Mings, and have now done the last office of laying him in\nthe ground. We would be glad we had any other to offer after him,\nand in revenge of him — all we have is our lives. If you will please to\nget his Royal Highness to give us a Fireshipp among us all, here is a\nDozen of us, out of all which choose you one to be commander, and\nthe rest ofus, whoever he is, will serve him, and, if possible, do that\nthat shall show our memory of our dead commander and our\nrevenge.”’ Sir W. Coventry was herewith much moved (as well as I,\n631\nwho could hardly abstain from weeping) and took their names; and\nso parted, telling me that he would move his Royal Highness as in a\nthing very extraordinary, and so we parted. The truth is, Sir Chr.\nMings was a very stout man, and a man of great parts and most\nexcellent tongue among ordinary men; and as Sir W. Coventry\nsays, could have been the most useful man in the world at such a\npinch of time as this. He was come into great renowne here at\nhome, and more abroad, in the West Indys. He had brought his\nfamily into a way of being great. But dying at this time, his\nmemory and name (his father being always, and at this day, a\nShoomaker, and his mother a Hoymans daughter, of which he was\nused frequently to boast) will be quite forgot in a few months, as if\nhe had never been, nor any of his name be the better by it — he\nhaving not had time to coll[ect] any estate; but is dead poor rather\nthen rich. So we left the church and crowd, and I home (being set\ndown on Tower hill) and there dida little business, and then in the\nevening went down by water to Deptford, it being very late. And\nthere I stayed out as much time as I could and then took boat again\nhomeward. But the officers being gone in, returned and walked to\nMrs. Bagwell’s house; and there (it being by this time pretty dark\nand past 10 a-clock) went into her house and did what I would. So\naway to the waterside and sent for a pint of sack, and so home,\ndrank what I would and gave the waterman the rest, and so adieu.\nHome about 12 at night, and so to bed — finding most of my people\ngone to bed.

Then being dressed, I down by water to\nDeptford and there did a great deal of business, being in a mighty\nhurry — Sir W.

Business\nbeing done, in providing for the carrying down of some provisions\n634\n24 June 1666\nto the fleet, I away back home. And after dinner, by water to\nWhitehall and there waited, till the Council rose, in the boarden\ngallery. By and by the Council rises, and Sir W. Coventry comes\nout and he and I went aside and discoursed of much business of the\nNavy; and afterwards took his coach and to Hide parke, he and I\nalone. There we had much talk. First, he started a discourse of a talk\nhe hears about the town, which, says he, is a very bad one, and fit to\nbe suppressed if we knew how: which is the comparing of the\nsuccess of the last year with that of this, saying that that was good\nand that bad. Then to discourse of himself, saying that he heard that\nhe was under the lash of people’s discourse about the Princes not\nhaving notice of the Dutch being out and for him to come back\nagain, nor the Duke of Albemarle notice that the Prince was sent for\nback again. To which, he told me very perticularly how careful he\nwas, the very same night that it was to resolve to send for the Prince\nback, to cause orders to be writ; and waked the Duke,! who was\nthen in bed, to sign them; and that they went by express that very\nnight, being the Wednesdy night before the Fight, which begun on\nthe Friday; and that, for sending them by the post express and not\nby gentlemen on purpose, he made a sportofit, and said, “I knew\nnone to send it with but would at least have lost more time in fitting\nthemselfs out then any diligence of theirs beyond that that the\nordinary post would have recovered.” I told him that this was not\nso much the towne talk as the reason of dividing the Fleete. To this,\nhe told me he ought not to say much; but did assure me in general,\nthat the proposition did first come from the Fleete; and the\nresolution not being prosecuted with orders so soon as the Generall?\nthought fit, the Generall did send Sir Edwd. Spragge up\non purpose for them; and that there was nothing in the whole\nbusiness which was not done with the full consent and advice of the\nDuke of Albemarle. He tells me, as to the business of Intelligence,\nthe want whereof the world did complain much of, that for that it\nwas not his business, and as he was therefore to have no share in the\nblame, so he would not meddle to lay it anywhere else. He doth not\ndisowne but that the dividing of the fleet, upon the presumptions\nthat was then had (which I suppose was the French fleet being come\nthis way), was a good resolution.\n1.

As to public business: by late\ntidings of the French Fleete being come to Rochell (how true,\nthough, Iknow not), our fleet is Divided; Prince Rupert being gone\nwith about 30 ships to the Westward; as is conceived, to meet the\nFrench, to hinder their coming to join with the Duch. My Lord\nDuke of Albemarle lies in the Downes with the rest, and intends\npresently to sail to the Gunfleete.\n—% JUNE4-\n2. Up, and to the office, where certain news is brought usof a\nletter come to the King this morning from the Duke of Albemarle,\ndated yesterday at 11 a-clock as they were sailing to the Gunfleet,\n622\nthat they were in sight of the Duch Fleete and were fitting themselfs\nto fight them — so that they are, ere this, certainly engaged; besides,\nseveral do averr they heard the guns all yesterday in the afternoon.\nThis put us at the board into a Tosse. Presently comes orders for our\nsending away to the fleet a recruite of 200 soldiers. So I rose from\nthe table, and to the Victualling Office and thence upon the river\namong several vessels, to consider of the sending them away; and\nlastly down to Greenwich and there appointed two Yachts to be\nready for them — and did order the soldiers to march to Blackewall.\nHaving set all things in order against the next Flood, I went on\nshore with Capt. Erwin at Greenwich and into the parke and there\nwe could hear the guns from the Fleete most plainly. Thence he and\nIto the King’s head and there bespokea dish of steaks for our dinner\nabout 4 a-clock. While that was doing, we walked to the waterside,\nand there seeing the King and Duke come down in their barge to\nGreenwich house, I to them and did give them an account what I\nwas doing. They went up to the park to hear the guns of the fleet go\noff. All our hopes now is that Prince Rupert with his fleet is coming\nback and will be with the fleet this noon — a message being sent to\nhim to that purpose on Wednesday last. And a return is come from\nhim this morning, that he did intend to sail from St. Ellens point\nabout 4 in the afternoon on Wednesday, which was yesterday;\nwhich gives us great hopes, the wind being very fair, that he is with\nthem this noon; and the fresh going-off of the guns makes us believe\nthe same. After dinner, having nothing else to do till flood, I went\nand saw Mrs. Daniel — to whom I\ndid not tell that the fleets were\nengaged, because of her husband, who is in the Royal Charles. Very\npleasant with her half an hour, and so away, and down to\nBlackewall and there saw the soldiers (who were by this time gotten\nmost of them drunk) shipped off. But Lord, to see how the poor\nfellows kissed their wifes and sweethearts in that simple manner at\ntheir going off, and shouted and let off their guns, was strange\nsport.

But in the country in several places it rages mightily, and\nperticularly in Colchester, where it hath long been, and is believed\nwill quite depopulate the place. To St. James’s, and there did our\nusual business with the Duke, all of us. Among other things,\ndiscoursing about the places where to build ten great ships, the\nKing and Council have resolved on none to be under third-rates;\nbut it is impossible to do it — unless we have more money towards\nthe doing it then yet we have in any view. But however, the show\nmust be made to the world. Thence home and dined; and then to the\noffice, where busy all day. And in the evening Sir W. Pen came to\nme, and we walked together and talked of the late fight. I find him\nvery plain that the whole conduct of the late fight was ill, and that\nthat of truth’s all, and he tells me that it is not he, but two-thirds of\nthe commanders of the whole fleet have told him so - they all saying\nthat they durst not oppose it at the council of war, for fear of being\ncalled Cowards, though it was wholly against their judgment to\nfight that day with that disproportion of force; and then we not\nbeing able to use one gun of our lower tire, which was a greater\ndisproportion then the other. Besides, we might very well have\nstayed in the Downs without fighting, or anywhere else, till the\n639\nPrince could have come up to them — or at least till the weather was\nfair, that we might have the benefit of our whole force in the ships\nthat we had. He says three things must [be] remedied, or else we\nshall be undone, by this fleet.\n1. That we must fight ina line, whereas we fight promiscuously,\nto our utter and demonstrable ruine — the Duch fighting\notherwise — and we, whenever we beat them.\n2. We must not desert ships of our own in distress as we did, for\nthat makes a captain desperate, and will fling away his ship\nwhen there is no hopes left him of succour.\n3. That ships, when they area little shattered, must not take the\nliberty to come in of themselfs; but refit themselfs the best\nthey can, and stay out — many of our ships coming in with\nvery small disablings.\nHe told me that our very commanders, nay, our very flag-\nofficers, do stand in need of exercizing among themselfs and\ndiscoursing the business of commandingafleet — he telling me that\neven one of our flagmen in the fleet did not know which Tacke lost\nthe wind or which kept it in the last engagement. He says it was\npure dismaying and fear that made them all run upon the Galloper,\nnot having their wits about them; and that it was a miracle they\nwere not all lost. He much inveighs upon my discoursing of Sir\nJohn Lawson’s saying heretofore, that 60 sail would do as much as\n100. And says that he was a man of no counsel at all, but had got the\nconfidence to say as the gallants did, and did propose to himself to\nmake himself great by them, and saying as they did; but was no man\nofjudgment in his business, but had been out in the greatest points\nthat have come before them. And then in the business of\nForecastles, which he did oppose, all the world sees now the use of\nthem for shelter of men. He did talk very rationally to me,\ninsomuch that I took more pleasure this night in hearing him\ndiscourse then I ever did in my life in anything that he said.

So our\nbusiness here being ayre, this is the best way, only witha little\nmixture of Statues or pots, which may be handsome, and so filled\nwith another pot of such or such, a flower or greene, as the season of\nthe year will bear. And then for Flowers, they are best seen in little\nplat by themselfs; besides, their borders spoil the walks of any other\ngarden. And then for fruit, the best way is to have Walls built\nCircularly, one within another, to the South, on purpose for fruit,\nand leaving the walking-garden only for that use.

And at noon to dinner to the Popes head,\nwhere my Lord Brouncker (and his mistress dined) and Comis-\nsioner Pett, Dr. Charleton, and myself entertained with a venison\npasty by Sir W. Warren. Here, very pretty discourse of Dr.\nCharleton concerning Nature’s fashioning every creature’s teeth\naccording to the food she intends them. And that man’s, it is plain,\nwas not for flesh, but for fruit. And that he can at any time tell the\nfood of a beast unknown, by the teeth. My Lord Brouncker made\none or two objections to it; that creatures find their food proper for\ntheir teeth, rather then that the teeth was fitted for the food. But the\nDoctor, I think, did well observe that creatures do naturally, and\nfrom the first, before they have had experience to try, do love sucha\nfood rather then another. And that all children love fruit, and none\nbrought to flesh but against their wills at first. Thence with my\nLord to his Coach-house, and there put in six horses into his coach\nand he and I alone to Highgate — all the way, going and coming, I\nlearning of him the principles of Optickes, and what it is that makes\nan object seem less or bigger. And how much distance doth lessen\n645\nan object. And that it is not the eye at all, or any rule in optiques,\nthat can tell distance; but it is only an act of reason, comparing of\none mark with another. Which did both please and inform me\nmightily. Being come thither, we went to my Lord Lauderdale’s\nhouse to speak with him about getting a man at Lieth to join with\none we imploy to buy some prize goods for the King. We find [him]\nand his lady and some Scotch people at supper — pretty odd\ncompany; though my Lord Brouncker tells me my Lord Lauder-\ndale is a man of mighty good reason and judgment. But at supper\nthere played one of their servants upon the viallin, some Scotch\ntunes only — several — and the best of their country, as they seemed\nto esteem them by their praising and: admiring them; but Lord, the\nstrangest ayre that ever I heard in my life, and all of one cast. But\nstrange to hear my Lord Lauderdale say himself, that he had rather\nhear a Catt mew then the best Musique in the world —and the better\nthe music, the more sick it makes him.

Bludworth, a\nsilly man I\nthink) and other places about getting shipped some men that they\nhave these two last nights pressed in the City out of houses — the\npersons wholly unfit for sea, and many of them people of very good\nfashion — which is a shame to think of; and carried to Bridewell they\nare, yet without being impressed with money legally, as they ought\nto be. But to see how the King’s business is done, my Lord Mayor\nhimself did scruple, at this time of extremity, to do this thing,\nbecause he had not money to pay the prest money to the men — he\ntold me so himself; nor to take up boats to carry them down\nthrough bridge to the ships I have prepared to carry them down in.\nInsomuch that I was forced to promise to be his paymaister; and he\ndid send his City Remembrancer afterward to the office, and at the.\ntable, in the face of the officers, I did there out of my own purse\ndisburse 15] to pay for their pressing and diet last night and this\nmorning — which is a thing worth record of my Lord Mayor. Busy\nabout this all the morning. At noon dined, and then to the office\nagain, and all the afternoon, till 12 at night, full of this business and\nothers. And among those others, about the getting of men pressed\nby our officers of the fleet into the service, even our own men that\n[are] at the office and the boats that carries us — so that it is now\nbecome impossible to have so much asa\nletter carried from place to\nplace, or any message done for us. Nay, out of victualling ships full\nloaden to go down to the fleet, and out of vessels of the Officers of\nthe Ordinance, they press men; so that for want of discipline in this\nrespect, I do fear all will be undone. Vexed with these things, but\neased in mind by my ridding of a great deal of business from the\noffice, I late home to supper and to bed. But before I was in bed,\n637\n1666 30 June-1 July\nwhile I was undressing myself, our new ugly maid Luce had like to\nhave broke her neck in the dark, going down our upper stairs; but\n(which I was glad of) the poor girl did only bruise her head. But at\nfirst did lie on the ground groaning, and drawing her breath like one\na-dying.\nThis month I end in much hurry of business, but in much more\ntrouble in mind to think what will become of public businesses,\nhaving so many enemies abroad, and neither force — nor money at\nall — and but little Courage for ourselfs. It being really true that the\nspirits of our seamen, and commanders too, are really broke by the\nlast defeat with the Duch; and this is not my conjecture only, but the\nreal and serious thoughts of Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Coventry, -\nwhom I have at distinct times hear[d] the same thing come from,\nwith a great deal of grief and trouble. But lastly, I am providing\nagainst a foul day, to get as much money into my hands as I can, at\nleast out of the public hands, that so, if a turn (which I fear) do\ncome, I may havea little to trust to. I pray God give me good\nsuccess in my choice how to dispose of what little Ihave, that I may\nnot take it out of public hands and put it into worse.\n— JULY\n3\n1. Sunday. Up betimes and to the office, receiving letters, two or\nthree one after another, from Sir W. Coventry, and sent as many to\nhim — being full of variety of business and hurry; but among the\nchiefest, is the getting of these pressed men out of the City down the\nRiver to the fleet. While I was hard at it, comes Sir W. Pen to town,\nwhich I little expected, having invited my Lady and her daughter\nPegg to dine with me today — which at noon they did, and Sir W.\nPenn with them, and pretty merry we were. And though I do not\nlove him, yet I find it necessary to keep in with him — his good\nservice at Sherenesse in getting out the fleet being much taken\nnotice of, and reported to the King and Duke even from the Prince\nand Duke of Albemarle themselfs, and made the most of to me and\nthem by Sir W. Coventry. Therefore, Ithink it discretion, great and\nnecessary discretion, to keep in with him. After dinner to the office\nagain, where busy; and then down to Deptford to the yard,\nthinking to have seen Bagwell’s wife, whose husband is gone\nyesterday back to the fleet; but I did not see her, so missed what I\n638\nwent for; and so back and to the Tower several times about the\nbusiness of the pressed men, and late at it, till 12 at night, shipping\nof them. But Lord, how some poor women did cry, and in my life I\nnever did see such natural expression of passion as | did here — in\nsome women’s bewailing themselfs, and running to every parcel of\nmen that were brought, one after another, to look for their\nhusbands, and wept over every vessel that went off, thinking they\nmight be there, and looking after the ship as far as ever they could\nby moonelight — that it grieved me to the heart to hear them.\nBesides, to see poor patient labouring men and housekeepers,\nleaving poor wifes and families, taken up on a sudden by strangers,\nwas very hard; and that without press-money, but forced against all\nlaw to be gone. It is a great tyranny. Having done this, I to the\nLieutenant of the Tower and bade him good-night, and so away\nhome and to bed."

At last sermon is done and he came home,\nand the bells immediately rung as soon as the church was done; but\ncoming to Sir W.

This was\nour work all the afternoon, trying the several glasses and several\nobjects; among others, one of my plats, where the lines appeared so\nvery plain, that it is not possible to think how plain it was done.\nThence, satisfied exceedingly with all this, we home, and to\ndiscourse many pretty things; and so stayed out the afternoon till it\nbegun to be dark and then they away, and I to Sir W.

The\nResolution burned; but, as they say, most of her [men] and\ncommander saved. This is all; only, we keep the sea; which denotes\na victory, or at least that we are not beaten. But no great matters to\nbrag on, God knows. So home to supper and to bed.\n—% AUGUST#-\n5. Lords day. Up, and down to the old Swan; and there called\nBetty Michell and her husband and had two or three long salutes\nfrom her out ofsight of su marido, which pleased me mightily. And\nso carried them by water to Westminster; and I to St. James’s and\nthere had a meeting before the Duke of York, complaining of want\nof money; but nothing done to any purpose, for want we shall; so\nthat now our advices to him signify nothing. Here Sir W. Coventry\ndid acquaint the Duke of York how the world doth discourse ofthe\nill method of our books, and that we would consider how to answer\nany enquiry which shall be made after our practice therein — which\nwill, I think, concern the Controller most. But I shall make it a\nmemento to myself. Thence walked to the parish church to have\none look upon Betty Michell; and so away homeward by water,\nand landed.to go to the church, where I believe Mrs. Horsly goes,\nby Merchant-Taylor hall. And there I find in the pulpit Elborough,\nmy old schoolfellow and a simple rogue; and yet I find preaching a\nvery good sermon, and in as right a parson-like manner, and in\n647\ngood manner too, as Ihave heard anybody; and the church very fuil\n— which is a surprizing consideration. But I did not see her. So\nhome, and had a good dinner; and after dinner, with my wife and\nMercer and Jane by water all the afternoon up as high as\nMoreclacke, with great pleasure, and a fine day — reading over the\nsecond part of The Siege ofRhodes with great delight. We landed and\nwalked at Barne elmes; and then at the neat houses I landed and\nbought a Millon (and we did also land and eat and drink at\nWandsworth); and so to the Old Swan, and there walked home —it\nbeing a mighty fine evening, cool evening; and there being come,\nmy wife and I spent an hour in the garden, talking of our living in\nthe country when I shall be turned out of the office, as I fear the\nParliament may find faults enough with the office to remove us all.\nAnd I am joyed to think in how good a condition I am to retire\nthither, and have wherewith very well to subsist.

Sir W.

And in the evening Sir W. Penn and Idid dig another and put our\nwine in it, and I my parmazan cheese as well as my wine and some\nother things. The Duke of York was at the office this day at Sir W.\nPenn’s, but I happened not to be within. This afternoon, sitting\nmelancholy with Sir W.

So Sir W. Penn he went down this night, in order\nto the sending them up tomorrow morning; and I wrote to Sir W.\nCoventry about the business, but received no answer.\n_ This night Mrs. Turner (who, poor woman, was removing her\ngoods all this day — good goods, into the garden, and knew not how\nto dispose of them) — and her husband supped with my wife and I at\nnight in the office, upon a shoulder of mutton from the cook’s,\nwithout any napkin or anything, in a sad manner but were merry.\nOnly, now and then walking into the garden and saw how horridly\nthe sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was enough to put us out of\nour wits; and endeed it was extremely dreadfull — for it looks just as\nifit was at us, and the whole heaven on fire. I after supper walked in\nthe dark down to Tower street, and there saw it all on fire at the\nTrinity house on that side and the Dolphin tavern on this side,\nwhich was very near us — and the fire with extraordinary\nvehemence. Now begins the practice of blowing up of houses in\nTower street, those next the Tower, which at first did frighten\npeople more then anything; but it stop[ped] the fire where it was\ndone —it bringing down the houses to the ground in the same places\nthey stood, and then it was easy to quench what little fire was in it,\nthough it kindled nothing almost. W. Hewer this day went to see\nhow his mother did, and comes late home, but telling us how he\nhath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in pye\n664\nCorner being burned. So that it is got so far that way and all the Old\nBayly, and was running down to Fleetestreet. And Pauls is burned,\nand all Cheapside. I wrote to my father this night; but the post-\nhouse being burned, the letter could not go."

There when I came, I find the gates shut, but no guard\nkept at all; which troubled me, because of discourses now begun\nthat there is plot in it and that the French had done it.

But going to the fire, Ifind, by\nthe blowing up of houses and the great help given by the workmen\nout of the King’s yards, sent up by Sir W.

I became\nafeared to stay there long; and therefore down again as fast as I\ncould, the fire being spread as far as I could see it, and to Sir W.\nPenn’s and there eat a piece of cold meat, having eaten nothing since\nSunday but the remains of Sunday’s dinner.\nHere I met with Mr. Young and Whistler; and having removed\nall my things, and received good hopes that the fire at our end is\nstopped, they and I walked into the town and find Fanchurch street,\nGracious street, and Lumbard street all in dust. The Exchange a sad\n665\nsight, nothing standing there ofall the statues or pillars but Sir Tho.\nGresham’s picture in the corner. Walked into Moorefields (our feet\nready to burn, walking through the town among the hot coles) and\nfind that full of people, and poor wretches carrying their goods\nthere, and everybody keeping his goods together by themselfs (and\na great blessing it is to them that it is fair weather for them to keep\nabroad night and day); drank there, and paid twopence for a plain\npenny loaf. Thence homeward, having passed through Cheapside\nand Newgate market, all burned — and seen Anthony Joyces house\nin fire. And took up (which I keep by me) a piece of glass of\nMercer’s chapel in the street, where much more was, so melted and\nbuckled with the heat of the fire, like parchment. I also did see a\npoor Catt taken out of\na hole in the chimney joyning to the wall of\nthe Exchange, with the hair all burned off the body and yet alive. So\nhome at night, and find there good hopesof saving our office — but\ngreat endeavours of watching all night and having men ready; and\nso we lodged them in the office, and had drink and bread and cheese\nfor them. And I lay down and slept a good night about midnight —\nthough when I rose, I hear that there had been a great alarme of\nFrench and Duch being risen — which proved nothing. But it is a\nstrange thing to see how long this time did look since Sunday,\nhaving been alway full of variety of actions, and little sleep, that it\nlooked like a week or more.

But the first\nhe cannot do, and the other as little, or says, ““‘When can we get any,\nor what shall we do for it?” He, it seems, is imployed in the\ncorrespondence between the City and the King every day, in\nsettling of things. I find him full of trouble to think how things will\ngo. I left him, and to St. James’s, where we met first at Sir W.\n668\n& September 1666\nCoventry’s chamber and there did what business we can without\nany books. Our discourse, as everything else, was confused. The\nfleet is at Portsmouth, there staying a wind to carry them to the\nDownes or toward Bullen, where they say the Duch fleete is gone\nand stays. We concluded upon private meetings for a while, not\nhaving any money to satisfy any people that may come to us. I\nbought two eeles upon the Thames, cost me 6s. Thence with Sir W.\nBatten to the Cockpit, whither the Duke of Albemarle is come. It\nseems the King holds him so necessary at this time, that he hath sent\nfor him and will keep him here. Endeed, his interest in the City,\nbeing acquainted, and his care in keeping things quiet, is reckoned\nthat wherein he will be very serviceable. We to him. He is courted\nin appearance by everybody. He very kind to us. I perceive he lays\nby all business of the fleet at present and minds the City, and is now\nhastening to Gresham College to discourse with the Aldermen. Sir\nW. Batten and I home (where met by my Brother John, come to\ntown to see how things are with us). And then presently he with me\nto Gresham College — where infinite of people; partly through\nnovelty to see the new place, and partly to find out and hear what is\nbecome one man of another. I met with many people undone, and\nmore that have extraordinary great losses. People speaking their\nthoughts variously about the beginning of the fire and the\nrebuilding of the City. Then to Sir W. Batten and took my brother\nwith me, and there dined with a great company of neighbours, and\nmuch good discourse; among others, of the low spirits of some rich\nmen in the City, in sparing any encouragement to the poor people\nthat wrought for the saving their houses. Among others, Ald.\nStarling, a very rich man, without children, the fire at next door to\nhim in our Lane — after our men had saved his house, did give 2s. 6d.\namong 30 of them, and did quarrel with some that would remove\nthe rubbish out of the wayofthe fire, saying that they came to steal.\nSir W. Coventry told me of another this morning in Holborne,\nwhich he showed the King — that when it was offered to stop the fire\nnear his house for such a reward, that came but to 2s. 6d. a man\namong the neighbours, he would give but 18d. Thence to Bednall\ngreen by coach, my brother with me, and saw all well there and\nfetched away my Journall-book to enter for five days past. To the\noffice, and late writing letters; and then to Sir W. Penn, my brother\nlying with me, and Sir W. Penn gone down to rest himself at\nWoolwich. But I was much frighted, and kept awake in my bed, by\nsome noise I heard a great while below-stairs and the boys not\n669\ncoming up to me when I knocked. It was by their discovery of\npeople stealing of some neighbours’ wine that lay in vessels in the\nstreet. So to sleep. And all well all night."

And then speaking of the\nsupplies which have been made to this fleet, more then ever in all\nkinds to any, even that wherein the Duke of York himself was —\n“Well,” says he, “if this will not do, I will say, as Sir\nJ.Falstaffe did\nto the Prince — ‘Tell your father, that if he do not like this, let him\nkill the next Piercy himself.’”’ And so we broke up, and to the Duke\nand there did our usual business.\n—* SEPTEMBER4-\n2. Lords day. Some of our maids sitting up late last night to get\nthings ready against our feast today, Jane called us up, about 3 in the\nmorning, to tell us of great fire they saw in the City. So Irose, and\nslipped on my nightgown and went to her window, and thought it\nto be on the back side of Markelane at the furthest; but being unused\nto such fires as fallowed, I thought it far enough off, and so went to\nbed again and to sleep. About 7 rose again to dress myself, and there\nlooked out at the window and saw the fire not so much as it was,\nand further off. So to my closet to set things to rights after\nyesterday’s cleaning. By and by Jane comes and tells me that she\nhears that above 300 houses have been burned down tonight by the\nfire we saw, and that it was now burning down all Fishstreet by\nLondon Bridge. So I made myself ready presently, and walked to\nthe Tower and there got up upon one of the high places, Sir J.\nRobinsons little son going up with me; and there Idid see the houses\nat that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this\nand the other side the end of the bridge — which, among other\npeople, did trouble me for poor little Michell and our Sarah on the\nBridge. So down, with my heart full of trouble, to the Lieutenant of\nthe Tower, who tells me that it begun this morning in the King’s\nbakers house in Pudding lane, and that it hath burned down St.\nMagnes Church and most part ofFishstreete already. So 1 down to\nthe waterside and there got a boat and through the bridge, and there\nsaw a lamentable fire. Poor Michells house, as far as the Old Swan,\nalready burned that way and the fire running further, that in a very\n659\n1666 2 September\nlittle time it got as far as the Stillyard while I was there. Everybody\nendeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the River or\nbringing them into lighters that lay off. Poor people staying in their\nhouses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running\ninto boats or clambering from one pair of stair by the waterside to\nanother. And among other things, the poor pigeons Iperceive were\nloath to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and\nbalconies till they were some of them burned, their wings, and fell\ndown.\nHaving stayed, and in an hour’s time seen the fire rage every way,\nand nobody to my sight endeavouring to quench it, but to remove\ntheir godds and leave all to the fire; and having seen it get as far as\nthe Steeleyard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the\ncity, and everything, after so long a drougth, proving combustible,\neven the very stones of churches, and among other things, the poor\nsteeple by which pretty Mrs. [Horsley] lives, and whereof my old\nschoolfellow Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top and\nthere burned till it fall down—I to Whitehall with a gentleman with\nme who desired to go off from the Tower to see the fire in my boat—\nto Whitehall, and there up to the King’s closet in the chapel, where\npeople came about me and I did give them an account dismayed\nthem all; and word was carried in to the King, so Iwas called for and\ndid tell the King and Duke of York what I saw, and that unless his\nMajesty did command houses to be pulled down, nothing could\nstop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King com-\nmanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him and command him\nto spare no houses but to pull down before the fire every way. The\nDuke of York bid me tell him that if he would have any more\nsoldiers, he shall; and so did my Lord Arlington afterward, as a\ngreat secret. Here meeting with Capt. Cocke, I in his coach, which\nhe lent me, and Creed with me, to Pauls; and there walked along\nWatling street as well as I could, every creature coming away\nloaden with goods to save — and here and there sick people carried\naway in beds. Extraordinary good goods carried in carts and on\nbacks. At last met my Lord Mayor in Canning Streete, like a man\nspent, with a handkercher about his neck. To the King’s message,\nhe cried like a fainting woman, “Lord, what can I do? I am spent!\nPeople will not obey me. I have been pull[ing] down houses. But\nthe fire overtakes us faster then we can do it.”’ That he needed no\nmore soldiers; and that for himself, he must go and refresh himself,\nhaving been up all night. So he left me, and Ihim, and walked home\n660\n2 September 1666\n— seeing people all almost distracted and no manner of means used\nto quench the fire. The houses too, so very thick thereabouts, and\nfull of matter for burning, as pitch and tar, in Thames street — and\nwarehouses of oyle and wines and Brandy and other things. Here I\nsaw Mr. Isaccke Houblon, that handsome man — prettily dressed\nand dirty at his door at Dowgate, receiving some of his brothers\nthings whose houses were on fire; and as he says, have been\nremoved twice already, and he doubts (as it soon proved) that they\nmust be ina little time removed from his house also — which was a\nsad consideration. And to see the churches all filling with goods, by\npeople who themselfs should have been quietly there at this time.\nBy this time it was about 12 a-clock, andso home and there find my\nguests, which was Mr. Wood and his wife, Barbary Shelden, and\nalso Mr. Moone-she mighty fine, and her husband, for aughtIsee,\na likely man. But Mr. Moones design and mine, which was to look\nover my closet and please him with the sight thereof, which he hath\nlong desired, was wholly disappointed, for we were in great trouble\nand disturbance at this fire, not knowing what to think of it.\nHowever, we had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry as at\nthis time we could be. While at dinner, Mrs. Batelier came to\nenquire after Mr. Woolfe and Stanes (who it seems are related to\nthem), whose houses in Fishstreet are all burned, and they in a sad\ncondition. She would not stay in the fright.\nAs soon as dined, I and Moone away and walked through the\nCity, the streets full of nothing but people and horses and carts\nloaden with goods, ready to run over one another, and removing\ngoods from one burned house to another — they now removing out\nof Canning street (which received goods in the morning) into\nLumbard Streete and further; and among others, I now saw my\nlittle goldsmith Stokes receiving some friend’s goods, whose house\nitself was burned the day after. We parted at Pauls, he home andI to\nPauls Wharf, where Ihad appointed a boat to attend me; and took in\nMr. Carcasse and his brother, whom I met in the street, and carried\nthem below and above bridge, to and again, to see the fire, which\nwas now got further, both below and above, and no likelihood of\nstopping it. Met with the King and Duke of York in their Barge,\nand with them to Queen Hith and there called Sir Rd. Browne to\nthem. Their order was only to pull down houses apace, and so\nbelow bridge at the waterside; but little was or could be done, the\nfire coming upon them so fast. Good hopes there was of stopping it\nat the Three Cranes above, and at Buttolphs Wharf below bridge, if\n661\n1666 2 September\ncare be used; but the wind carries it into the City, so as we know not\nby the waterside what it doth there. River full of lighter[s] and boats\ntaking in goods, and good goods swimming in the water; and only,\nI observed that hardly one lighter or boat in three that had goods of\na house in, but there was a pair of virginalls in it. Having seen as\nmuch as I could now, I away to Whitehall by appointment, and\nthere walked to St. James’s Park, and there met my wife and Creed\nand Wood and his wife and walked to my boat, and there upon the\nwater again, and to the fire up and down, it still increasing and the\nwind great. So near the fire as we could for smoke; and all over the\nThames, with one’s face in the wind you were almost burned witha\nshowerof Firedrops — this is very true—so as houses were burned by\nthese drops and flakes of fire, three or four, nay five or six houses,\none from another. When we could endure no more upon the water,\nwe to a little alehouse on the Bankside over against the Three\nCranes, and there stayed till it was dark almost and saw the fire\ngrow; and as it grow darker, appeared more and more, and in\nCorners and upon steeples and between churches and houses, as far\nas we could see up the hill of the City, in a most horrid malicious\nbloody flame, not like the fine flame of an ordinary fire. Barbary\nand her husband away before us. We stayed till, it being darkish, we\nsaw the fire as only one entire arch of fire from this to the other side\nof the bridge, and in a bow up the hill, for an arch of above a mile\nlong. It made me weep to see it. The churches, houses, and all on\nfire and flaming at once, and a horrid noise the flames made, and the\ncracking of houses at their ruine.\nSo home with a sad heart, and there find everybody discoursing\nand lamenting the fire; and poor Tom Hater came with some few of\nhis goods saved out of his house, which is burned upon Fish street\nhill. I invited him to lie at my house, and did receive his goods: but\nwas deceived in his lying there, the noise coming every moment of\nthe growthof the Fire, so as we were forced to begin to pack up our\nown goods and prepare for their removal. And did by Mooneshine\n(it being brave, dry, and moonshine and warm weather) carry\nmuch of my goods into the garden, and Mr. Hater and I did remove\nmy money and Iron chests into my cellar—as thinking that the safest\nplace. And got my bagsofgold into my office ready to carry away,\nand my chief papers of accounts also there, and my tallies into a box\nby themselfs. So great was our fear, as Sir W. Batten had carts come\nout of the country to fetch away his goods this night. We did put\nMr. Hater, poor man, to beda little; but he got but very little rest,\n662\nso much noise being in my house, taking down of goods."

    "text": "Lords day. Up, and after visiting my father in his chamber, to\nchurch, and then home to dinner. Little Michell and his wife came\nto dine with us — which they did; and then presently after dinner, I\nwith Sir\nJ.Mennes to Whitehall, where met by W. Batten and Lord\nBrouncker, to attend the King and Duke of York at the Cabinet; but\nnobody had determined what to speak of, but only in general to ask\nfor money — so I was forced immediately to prepare in my mind a\nmethod of discoursing. And anon we were called in to the green\nroom, where the King, Duke of York, Prince Rupert, Lord\nChancellor, Lord Treasurer, Duke of Albemarle, G. Carteret, W.\nCoventry, Morrice. Nobody beginning, I did, and made a current\nand, I thought, a good speech, laying open the ill state of the Navy —\nby the greatness of the debt — greatness of work to do against next\nyear — the time and materials it would take — and our incapacity,\nI. i.e. a salary, which he had enjoyed since September 1664.\n678\n7 October 1666\nthrough a total want of money. I had no sooner done, but Prince\nRupert rose up and told the King in a heat that whatever the\ngentleman had said, he had brought home his fleet in as good a\ncondition as ever any fleet was brought home — that twenty boats\nwould be as many as the fleet would want — and all the anchors and\ncables left in the storm might be taken up again. This arose from my\nsaying, among other things we had to do, that the fleet was come in,\nthe greatest fleet that ever his Majesty had yet together, and that in\nas bad condition as the enemy or weather could put it. And to use\nSir W. Penn’s words, who is upon the place taking a Survey, he\ndreads the reports he is to receive from the Surveyorsofits defects. I\ntherefore did only answer that I was sorry for his Highness’s\noffence, but that what I said was but the report we received from\nthose entrusted in the fleet to inform us. He muttered, and repeated\nwhat he had said; and so after a long silence on all hands, nobody,\nnot so much as the Duke of Albemarle, seconding the Prince, nor\ntaking notice of what he said, we withdrew. I was not alittle\ntroubled at this passage; and the more, when speaking with Jacke\nFenn about it, he told me that the Prince will now be asking who\nthis Pepys is, and find him to be a creature of my Lord Sandwiches,\nand therefore this was done only to disparage him. Anon they\nbroke up and Sir W. Coventry came out, so I asked his advice: he\ntold me he had said something to salve it, which was that his\nHighnesse had, he believed, rightly informed the King that the fleet\nis in good condition to have stayed out yet longer, and hath fought\nthe enemy; but yet that Mr. Pepys his meaning might be that\nthough in so good condition, if they should come in and lie all the\nwinter, we shall be very loath to send them to sea for another year’s\nservice with[out] great repairs. He said it would be no hurt if|went\nto him and showed him the report himself brought up from the\nfleet, where every ship, by the commander’s report, doth need\nmore or less — and not to mention more of Sir W. Penn for doing\nhim a mischief; so I said I would — but do not think that all this will\nredound to my hurt, because the truth of what I said will soon\nappear. Thence, having been informed that after all this pains the\nKing hath found out how to supply us with 5 or 6000/, when\n100000! were at this time but absolutely necessary, and we\nmentioned 50000! — this is every day a greater and greater omen of\nRuine — God fit us for it — Sir\nJ.Mennes and I home (it raining) by\ncoach (calling only on Sir G. Carteret at his lodging, who is, I find,\ntroubled at my Lord Treasurer and Sir Ph. Warwick bungling in his\n679\naccounts); and being come home to supper, with my father, and\nthen all to bed. I made my brother in his Cassocke to say grace this\nday, but I like his voice so ill, that I begin to be sorry he hath taken\nthis order upon him."

After dinner Iand Sir Tho. Crew went aside to discourse\nof public matters, and do find by him that all the country gentlemen\nare publicly jealous of the Courtiers in the Parliament, and that they\ndo doubt everything that they propose. And that the true reason\nwhy the country-gentleman is for a land Tax and against a general\nExcize, is because they are fearful that if the latter be granted, they\nshall never get it down again; whereas the land tax will be but for so\nmuch, and when the war ceases there will be no ground got by the\nCourt to keep it up. He doth much cry out upon our accounts, and\nthat all that they have had from the King hath been but Estimates,\nboth from my Lord Treasurer and us, and from all people else — so\nthat the Parliament is weary of it. He says the House would be very\nglad to get something against Sir G. Carteret, and will not let their\nenquiries die till they have got something. He doth, from what he\nhath heard at the Committee for examining the burningofthe City,\nconclude it as a thing certain, that it was done by plot — it being\nproved by many witnesses that endeavours were made in several\nplaces to encrease the fire, and that both in city and country it was\nbragged by several papists that upon sucha day or in sucha time we\nshould find the hottest weather that ever was in England, and\nwords of plainer sense."

Downing (who loves and understands music)\nwould by all means have my song of Beauty Retire — which Knipp\nhath spread abroad, and he extols it above anything he ever heard.\nAnd without flattery, I think it is good in its kind. This being done,\nand going to dance again, comes news that Whitehall was on fire —\nand presently more perticulars, that the Horse guard was on fire.\nAnd so we run up to the garret and find it so, a horrid great fire—and\nby and by we saw and heard part of it blown up with powder. The\nladies begun presently to be afeared — one fell into fits. The whole\ntown in an Alarme. Drums beat and trumpets, and the guards\neverywhere spread — running up and down in the street. And I\nbegun to have mighty apprehensions how things might be at home,\nand so was in mighty pain to get home; and that that encreased all is\nthat we are in expectation (from common fame) this night or\ntomorrow to have a Massacre — by the having so many fires one\nafter another — as that in the City. And at the same time begun in\nWestminster by the Palace, but put out — and since in Southworke,\nto the burning down some houses; and now this, doth make all\npeople conclude there is something extraordinary in it, but nobody\nknows what. By and by comes news that the fire is slackened; so\nthen we were alittle cheered up again, and to supper and pretty\nmerry. After supper another dance or two, and then news that the\nfire is as great as ever, which put us all to our wit’s end, and |\nmightily [eager] to go home; but the coach being gone, and it being\nabout 10 at night and rainy dirty weather, Iknew not what to do but\nto walk out with Mr. Batelier, myself resolving to go home on foot\nand leave the women there. And so did; but at the Savoy got a coach\nand came back and took up the women; and so (having by people\ncome from the fire understood that the fire was overcome, and all\n690\nwell) we merrily parted, and home. Stopped by several guards and\nConstables quite through the town (round the wall as we went), all\nbeing in armes. We got well home; and in the way I did con mi\nmano tocar la jambe de Mercer sa chair. Elle retirait sa jambe\nmodestement, but I did tocar sa peau with my naked hand. And the\ntruth is, la fille hath something that is assez jolie. Being come home,\nwe to Cards till 2 in the morning; and drinking lamb’s-wool, to\nbed."

Presently after the King was come in, he took the\nQueene, and about fourteen more couple there was, and begun the\nBransles.

Only, Mrs. Steward danced mighty finely, and\nmany French dances, especially one the King called the New\nDance, which was very pretty. But upon the whole matter, the\nbusiness of the dancing itself was not extraordinary pleasing. But\nthe clothes and sight of the persons was indeed very pleasing, and\nworth my coming, being never likely to see more gallantry while I\nlive —if I should come twenty times. About 12 at night it broke up,\nand | to hire a coach with much difficulty; but Pierce had hired a\nchair for my wife, and so she being gone to his house — he and I\n(taking up Barker at Unthankes) to his house— whither his wife was\ncome home a good while ago, and gone to bed. So away home with\nmy wife — between displeased at the dull dancing, and satisfied at\nthe clothes and persons (my Lady Castlemayne (without whom all\nis nothing) being there, very rich, though not dancing); and so after\nsupper, it being very cold, to bed."

And I bless God, I do find that I\nam worth more then ever I yet was, which is 62001 — for which the\nholy name of God be praised. And my other accounts, of Tanger, in\na very plain and clear condition, that Iam not liable to any trouble\nfrom them. But in fear great 1am, and I perceive the whole City is,\nof some distractions and disorders among us, which God of his\ngoodness prevent. Late to supper with my wife and brother, and\nthen to bed.\nAnd thus ends the month — with an ill aspect. The business of the\nNavy standing wholly still. No credit. No goods sold us. Nobody\nwill trust. All we have to do at the office is to hear complaints for\nwant of money. The Duke of York himself, for now three weeks,\nseems to rest satisfied that we can do nothing without money, and\nthat all must stand still till the King gets money — which the\nParliament have been a great while about, but are so dissatisfied\nwith the King’s management, and his giving himself up to\npleasures, and not minding the calling to account any of his officers\n— and they observe so much the expense of the war, and yet that\nafter we have made it the most we can, it doth not amount to what\nthey have given the King for the Warr, that they are backward of\ngiving any more. However, 1800000! they have voted, but the way\nof gathering it hath taken up more time then is fit to be now lost.\nThe seamen grow very rude, and everything out of order —\ncommanders having no power over their seamen, but the seamen\ndo what they please. Few stay on board, but all coming running up\nhither to town; and nobody can with justice blame them, we owing\n685\n1666 31 October—2 November\nthem so much money, and their families must starve if we do not\ngive them money or they procure upon their tickets from some\npeople that will trust them. A great folly is observed by all people,\nin the King’s giving leave to so many merchantmen to go abroad\nthis winter, and some upon voyages where it is impossible they\nshould be back again by the spring; and the rest will be doubtful,\nbut yet we let them go. What the reasonofstate is, nobody can tell,\nbut all condemn it. The Prince and Duke of Albemarle have got no\ngreat credit by this year’s service, our losses, both of reputation and\nships, having been greater then is thought have ever been suffered\nin all ages put together before. Great folly in both Houses of\nParliament, several persons falling together by the eares; among\nothers, in the House of Lords, the Duke of Buckingham and my\nLord Ossory. Such is our case, that everybody fears an invasion the\nnext year; and for my part, I do methinks foresee some great\nunhappiness coming upon us, and do provide for it by laying by\nsomething against a rainy day — dividing what Ihave and laying it in\nseveral places — but with all faithfulness to the King in all respects —\nmy grief only being that the King doth not look after his business\nhimself, and thereby will be undone, both himself and his nations —\nit being not yet, Ibelieve, too late, ifhe would apply himself to it, to\nsave all and conquer the Duch; but while he and the Duke of York\nmind their pleasure as they do, and nothing else, we must be beaten.\nSo late, with my mind in good condition of quiet after the settling\nall my accounts, and to bed.\n-—*NOVEMBER%-\n2.

It seems a very\ngood ship, but with galleries quite round the Sterne to walk in, as a\nBalcone, which will be taken down. She had also about 40 good\nbrass guns, but will make little amends to our loss in the Prince.\nThence to the Ropeyard and the other yards to do several\nbusinesses. He, and I also, did buy some apples and pork; by the\nsame token, the Bucher commended it as the best in England for\nCloath and Colour — and for his beef, says he, “Look how fat it is;\nthe lean appears only here and there a speck, like Beauty spots.”\n686\nHaving done at Woolwich, we to Depford (it being very cold upon\nthe water) and there did alsoa little more business; and so home, I\nreading all the way to make end of The Bondman (which the oftener |\nread, the more Ilike), and begin The Duchesse ofMalfy, which seems\na good play.

Then comes out the King and Duke of York from the\nCouncil, and so I spoke a while to Sir W. Coventry about some\noffice business; and so called my wife and so home; and I to my\nchamber to do some business, and then to supper and to bed."

But ifyou would give him this imployment, he\nwere the fittest man in the world to perform it.’’ This he says is\nmost true.

He tells me how the Parliament is\ngrown so jealous of the King’s being unfayre to them in the business\nof the Bill for examining accounts — Irish Bill, and the business of\nthe papists, that they will not pass that business for money till they\nsee themselfs secure that those Bills will pass, which they observe\nthe Court to keep off till all the Bills come together, that the King\nmay accept what he pleases and what he pleases to reject — which\nwill undo all our business, and the kingdom too. He tells me how\nMr. Henery Howard of Norfolke hath given our Royall Society all\nhis grandfather’s Library; which is a noble gift they value at 1oool.\nAnd gives them accommodation to meet in at his house — Arundell\nhouse, they being now disturbed at Gresham College. Thence,\nlighting at the Temple, to the ordinary hard by and eat a bit of meat;\nand then by coach to fetch my wife from her b[rJother’s, and thence\nto the Duke’s house and saw Macbeth; which thoughI saw it lately,\nyet appears a most excellent play in all respects, but especially in\ndivertisement, though it be a deep tragedy; which is a strange\nperfection in a tragedy, it being most proper here and suitable. So\nhome to write over fair my vows for this year, and then to supper\nand to bed —in great peace of mind, having now doneit and brought\nmyself into order again and a resolution of keeping it — and having\nentered my Journall to this night. So to bed, my eyes failing me\nwith writing."

Coventry came to me aside in the\nDuke’s chamber, to tell that he had not answered part of\na late letter\nof mine, because littera Scripta manet — about his leaving the office —\nhe tells me because he finds that his business at Court will not\npermit him to attend it; and then he confesses that he seldomoflate\ncould come from it with satisfaction, and there[fore] would not\ntake the King’s money for nothing. I professed my sorrow for it,\nand prayed the continuance of his favour; which he promised. I do\nbelieve he hath done like a very wise man in reference to himself;\nbut I doubt it will prove ill for the King and for the office. Prince\nRupert, I hear today, is very ill — yesterday given over, but better\ntoday. This day before the Duke of York, the business of the\nMustermaisters was reported, and Balty found the best of the\nwhole number, so as the Duke enquired who he was and whether\nvrs\n1667 16 January\nhe was a stranger by his two names, both strange. And offered that\nhe and one more, who hath done the next best, should have not\nonly their own, but part of the others’ salary; but that, Ihaving said\nhe was my brother-in-law, did stop; but they two are ordered their\npay, which I am glad of, and someofthe rest will lose their pay and\nothers be laid by the heels. I was very glad of this being ended so\nwell. Then with the Duke of York to the King to receive his\ncommands for stopping the sale this day of some prize goods at the\nPrize Office, goods fit for the Navy, and received the King’s\ncommands and carried them to the Lords’ House to my Lord\nAshly, who was angry much thereat; and ] am sorry it fell to me to\ncarry thatorder, but I cannot help it; so against his will, he signed a\nnote I writ to the Commissioners of Prizes, which I carried and\ndelivered to Kingdom at their new office in Aldergate Streete.\nThencealittle to the Exchange, where it was hot that the Prince was\ndead, but I did rectify it. So home to dinner and found Balty, told\nhim the good news, and then after dinner away; I presently to\nWhitehall and did give the Duke of York a memorial of the salt\nbusiness against the Council. And did wait all the Council for\nanswer — walking a good while with Sir St. Fox; who, among other\nthings, told me his whole mystery in the business of the interest he\npays as Treasurer for the Army. They give him 12d. per cent quite\nthrough the Army, with condition to be paid weekly. This he\nundertakes upon his own private credit, and to be paid by the King\nat the end of every four months. If the King pay him not at the end\nof the four months, then for all the time he stays longer, my Lord\nTreasurer by agreement allows him8 per cent per annum for the\nforebearance — so that in fine, he hath about twelve per cent from\nthe King and the Army for fifteen or sixteen months’ interest — out\nof which he gains soundly, his expense being about 130000! per\nannum — and hath no trouble in it compared (as I told him) to the\ntrouble I must have to bring in an account of interest. I was,\nhowever, glad of being thus enlightened. And so away to the\ncouncil door, and there got in and hear a piece of a cause heard\nbefore the King, about a ship deserted by her fellows (who were\nbound mutually to defend each other) in their way to Virginy and\ntaken by the enemy — but it was but meanly pleaded.\nThis day Iobserve still in many places the smoking remains of the\nlate fire. The ways mighty bad and dirty. This night Sir R. Ford\ntold me how this day at Christ Church Hospital they have given a\nliving of 200! per annum to Mr. Sanchy, my old acquaintance;\n714\nwhich Iwonder at, he commending him mightily; but am glad ofit.\nHe tells me too, how the famous Stillingfleete was a Bluecoat boy.\nThe children at this day are provided for in the country by the\nHouse, which I am glad also to hear."

So he\nand I thither and did see the Organ; but I do not like it, it being but a\nbawble, with avirginall joining to it —so I shall not meddle with it.\nHere we sat and talked with him a good while, and he seems a good-\nnatured gentleman. Here I observed the Deske which he hath to\nremove, and is fastened to one of the armes of his Chayre. I do also\nobserve the counterfeit windows there was in the form of Doores,\nwith Looking glasses instead of windows, which makes the room\nseem both bigger and lighter I think; and I have some thoughts to\nhave the like in one of my rooms. He discoursed much of the\ngoodness of the Musique in Rome, but could not tell me how long\nMusique had been in any perfection in that Church — which Iwould\nbe glad to know. He speaks much of the great buildings that this\nPope (whom in mirth to us he calls Antichrist) hath done in his\ntime. Having done with this discourse, we away; and my Lord and I\nwalking into the parke back again, I did observe the new buildings;\nand my Lord seeing I hada desire to see them, they being the place\nfor the priests and Friers, he took me back to my Lord Almner and\nhe took us quite through the whole house and chapel and the new\nMonastery, showing me most excellent pieces in Waxworke — a\ncrucifix given by a Pope to Mary Queene of Scotts, where a piece of\n716\n23 January 1667\nthe Cross is — two bits set in the manner of a cross in the foot ofthe\ncrucifix. Several fine pictures, but especially very good prints of\nholy pictures. I saw the Dortoire and the Cells of the priests, and we\nwent into one — a very pretty little room, very clean, hung with\npictures — set with books. The priest was in his Cell — with his hair-\ncloths to his skin, bare-legged, with a Sandall only on, and his little\nbed without sheets, and no feather bed; but yet I thought saft\nenough. His Cord about his middle. But in so good company,\nliving with[out] care, I thought it a very good life. A pretty Library\nthey have, and I was in the Refectoire, where every man his napkin\n— knife —cup of earth —and basin of the same-—andaplace for one to\nsit and read while the rest are at meals. And into the Kitchin I went,\nwhere a good neck of Mutton at the fire — and other victuals boiling\n—I do not think they feed very hard. Their windows looking all into\na fine garden and the park. And mighty pretty rooms all. I wished\nmyself one of the Capuchins — having seen what we could here, and\nall with mighty pleasure. So away with the Almoner in his coach,\ntalking merrily about the difference in our religions, to Whitehall\nand there we left him.\nTo the New Exchange, there to take up my wife and Mercer, and\nto Temple Barr to my ordinary and had a dish of meat for them,\nthey having not dined; and thence to the King’s House and there\nsaw The Humerous Lieutenant—a silly play, Ithink —only the spirit in\nit, that grows very Tall and then sinks again to nothing, having two\nheads treading upon one, and then Knipps singing, did please us.\nHere, in a box above, we spied Mrs. Pierce; and going out, they\ncalled us, and so we stayed for them and Knipp took us all in and\nbrought to us Nelly, a most pretty woman, who acted the great\npart, Coelia, today very fine, and did it pretty well; I kissed her and\nso did my wife, and a mighty pretty soul she is. We also saw Mrs.\nHall, which is my little Roman-nose black girl that is mighty\npretty: she is usually called Betty. Knipp made us stay in a box and\nsee the dancing preparatory to tomorrow for The Goblins, a play of\nSuckelings not acted these 25 years, which was pretty; and so away\nthence, pleased with this sight also, and especially kissing of Nell;\nwe away, Mr. Pierce and I on foot to his house, the women by\ncoach. In our way we find the Guards of Horse in the street, and\nhear the occasion to be news that the Seamen are ina mutiny, which\nput me intoa great fright; so away with my wife and Mercer home,\npreparing against tomorrow night to have Mrs. Pierce and Knipp\nand a great deal more company to dance.

And after the play done, I out so\nsoon to meet her at the other door, that I left my cloak in the\nplayhouse; and while I returned to get it, she was gone out and\nmissed me, and with W.

I, not sorry for it\nmuch, did go to Whitehall and got my Lord Bellasses to get me into\nthe playhouse; and there, after all staying above an hour for the\nplayers (the King and all waiting, which was absurd), saw Henry the\n5th— well done by the Dukes people, and in most excellent habit, all\nnew vests, being put on but this night. But I sat so high and far off,\nthat I missed most of the words; and sat with a wind coming into\nmy back and neck, which did much trouble me. The play continued\ntill 12 at night; and then up, and a most horrid cold night it was, and\nfrosty — and moonshine. But the worst is, I had left my cloak at Sir\nG. Carteret’s; and they being abed, I was forced to go home\nwithout it. So by chance got a coach, and to the Golden Lion tavern\nin the Strand and there drank some mulled sack; and so home —\nwhere find my poor wife staying for me. And then to bed— mighty\ncold.\n707\n1666 31 December\n31. Rising this day witha full design to mind nothing else but to\nmake up my accounts for the year past, I did take money and walk\nforth to several places in the town, as far as the New Exchange, to\npay all my debts, it being still a very great frost and good walking. I\nstayed at the Fleece tavern in Covent garden, while my boy Tom\nwent to W. Joyces to pay what I owed for candles there. Thence to\nthe New Exchange to clear my wife’s score; and so going back\nagain, I met Doll Lane (Mrs. Martin’s sister) with another young\nwoman of the Hall, one Scott, and took them to the Half-Moon\ntavern and there drank some burned wine with them, without more\npleasure; and so away home by coach, and there to dinner and then\nto my accounts, wherein at last I find them clear and right; but to\nmy great discontent, do find that my gettings this year have been\n573! less then my last — it being this year in all, but 2986/; whereas\nthe last I got 3560/. And then again, my spendings this year have\nexceeded my spendings the last, by 644 — my whole spendings last\nyear being but 509/; whereas this year it appears Ihave spent 11541 —\nwhich is a sum not fit to be said that ever Ishould spend in one year,\nbefore I am maister of\na better estate then I am. Yet, blessed be God,\nand I pray God make me thankful for it, I do find myself worth in\nmoney, all good, above 6200l; which is above 1800/ more than I was\nthe last year. This, I trust in God, will make me thankful for what I\nhave, and careful to make up by care next year what by my\nnegligence and prodigality I have lost and spent this year. The\ndoing of this and entering it fair, with the sorting of all my expenses\nto see how and in what points I have exceeded, did make it late\nwork, till my eyes became very sore and ill; and then did give over,\nand supper and to bed.\nThus ends this year of public wonder and mischief to this nation—\nand therefore generally wished by all people to have an end. Myself\nand family well, having four maids and one clerk, Tom, in my\nhouse; and my brother now with me, to spend time in order to his\npreferment. Our healths all well; only, my eyes, with overworking\nthem, are sore as soon as candlelight comes to them, and not else.\nPublic matters in a most sad condition. Seamen discouraged for\nwant of pay, and are become not to be governed. Nor, as matters\nare now, can any fleet go out next year. Our enemies, French and\nDuch, great, and grow more, by our poverty. The Parliament\nbackward in raising, because jealous of the spending, of the money.\nThe City less and less likely to be built again, everybody settling\nelsewhere, and nobody encouraged to trade. A sad, vicious,\n708\n31 December 1666\nnegligent Court, and all sober men there fearful of the ruin of the\nwhole Kingdom this next year — from which, good God deliver us.\nOne thing I reckon remarkable in my own condition is that J am\ncome to abound in good plate, so as at all entertainments to be\nserved wholly with silver plates, having two dozen andahalf.\n709\nabnoks\nCope\nT\n“y\n—% JANUARY?-\n2. Up I, and walked to Whitehall to attend the Duke of York as\nusual. My wife up, and with Mrs. Pen to walk in the fields to frost-\nbite* themselfs. I find the Court full of great apprehensions of the\nFrench, who have certainly shipped landsmen, great numbers, at\nBrest; and most of our people here guess his design for Ireland. We\nhave orders to send all the ships we can possible to the Downes.\nGod have mercy onus, for we can send forth no ships without men;\nnor will men go without money, every day bringing us news of\nnew mutinies among the seamen — so that our condition is like to be\nvery miserable. Thence to Westminster hall and there met all the\nHoublons, who do laugh at this discourse of the French and say\nthey are verily of opinion it is nothing but to send to their\nplantations in the West Indys, and that we at Court do blow up a\ndesign of invading us only to make the Parliament make more haste\nin the money matters — and perhaps it may be so, but I do not\nbelieve we have any such plots in our heads. After them, I with\nseveral people; among others, Mr. George Mountagu, whom |\nhave not seen long. He mighty kind. He tells me all is like to go ill,\nthe King displeasing the House of Commons by evading their Bill\nfor examining accounts, and putting it into a commission. This\ndoth not please them. He tells me he finds the enmity almost over\nfor my Lord Sandwich, and that now all is upon the Vice\nchamberlaine, who bears up well and stands upon his vindication —\nwhich he seems to like well, and the others do construe well also. So\nto the Rose tavern, while Doll Lane came to me and we did biber a\ngood deal de vino, et jo did give ella 12 solidos para comprar ella\nsome gans for a new ano’s gift. I did tocar et no mas su cosa, but in\nfit time and place jo creo que je pouvais faire whatever I would con\nella. Thence to the Hall again and with Sir W. Pen by coach to the\nTemple, and there light and eat at an ordinary by; and then alone to\nthe King’s House and there saw The Custome of the Country, the\nsecond time of its being acted, wherein Knipp does the Widow\n710\nwell; but ofall the plays that ever I did see, the worst, having neither\nplot, language, nor anything in the earth that is acceptable. Only,\nKnipp singsalittle song admirably. But fully the worst play that\never I saw orI believe shall see. So away home, much displeased for\nthe loss of so much time, and disobliging my wife by being there\nwithout her; and so by link walked home, it being mighty cold but\ndry; yet bad walking because very slippery with the frost and\ntreading. Home and to my chamber to set down my journal; and\nthen to thinking upon establishing my Vows against the next year.\nAnd so to supper and to bed."

    "text": "Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning — with\nseveral things (among others) discoursed relating to our two new\nAssistant-Controllers; but especially Sir W. Penn, who is mighty\ntroublesome in it. At noon home to dinner, and then to the office\nagain and there did much business; and by and by comes Mr.\nMoore, who in discourse did almost convince me that it is necessary\nfor my Lord Sandwich to come home and take his command at Sea\nthis year, for that a peace is like to be. Many considerations he did\ngive me hereupon which were very good, both in reference to the\npublic and his private condition. By and by with my Lord\nBrouncker by coach to his house, there to hear some Italian\nMusique; and here we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Rob. Murray, and\nthe Italian Seignor Baptista —- who hath composeda play in Italian\nfor the Opera which T. Killigrew doth intend to have up; and here\nhe did sing one of the acts. Himself is the poet as well as the\nMusician, which is very much; and did sing the whole from the\nwords without any Musique pricked, and played all along upon a\nHarpsicon most admirably; and the composition most excellent.\nThe words I did not understand, and so know not how they are\nfitted; but believe very well, and all in the Recitativo very fine. But I\nperceive there is a proper accent in every country’s discourse; and\nthat doth reach in their setting of notes to words, which therefore\ncannot be natural to anybody else but them; so that I am not so\nmuch smitten with it as it may be I should be if I were acquainted\nwith their accent. But the whole composition is certainly most\nexcellent; and the poetry, T. Killigrew and Sir R. Murray, who\nunderstood the words, did say was excellent. I confess I was\nmightily pleased with the music. He pretends not to voice, though\nit be good but not excellent. This done, T. Killigrew and I to talk;\nand he tells me how the Audience at his House is not above half so\nmuch as it used to be before the late fire. That Knipp is like to make\n722\n12 February 1667\nthe best actor that ever came upon the stage, she understanding so\nwell. That they are going to give her 30/ a year more. That the stage\nis now by his pains a thousand times better and more glorious then\never heretofore.’ Now, wax-candles, and many of them; then, not\nabove 3/b. of tallow. Now, all things civil, no rudeness anywhere;\nthen, as in a bear-garden. Then, two or three fiddlers; now, nine or\nten of the best. Then, nothing but rushes upon the ground and\neverything else mean; and now, all otherwise. Then, the Queen\nseldom and the King never would come; now, not the King only\nfor state, but all civil people do think they may come as well as any.\nHe tells me that he hath gone several times, eight or ten times he\ntells me, hence to Rome to hear good music; so much he loves it,\nthough he never did sing or play a note. That he hath ever\nendeavoured, in the last King’s time and in this, to introduce good\nMusique; but he never could do it, there never having been any\nmusic here better then ballads. ““No’’, [he] says ‘“Hermitt poore and\nChivy chase was all the music we had — and yet no ordinary Fidlers\nget so much money as ours do here, which speaks our rudeness\nstill.” That he hath gathered nine Italians from several Courts in\nChristendome to come to make a consort for the King, which he\ndoth give 200l a year apiece to, but badly paid, and do come in the\nroom of keeping four ridiculous Gundilows — he having got the\nKing to put them away and lay out the money this way. And\nendeed, I do commend him for it, for I think it is a very noble\nundertaking. He doth entend to have some times of the year these\nOperas to be performed at the two present Theatres, since he is\ndefeated in what he intended in Moore Fields on purpose of it. And\nhe tells me plainly that the Citty Audience was as good as the Court\n— but now they are most gone.\nHaving done our discourse, we all took coaches (my Lord’s and\nT. Killigrew’s) and to Mrs. Knepp’s chamber, where this Italian is\nto teach her to sing her part. And so we all thither, and there she did\nsing an Italian song or two very fine, while he played the bass upon\na Harpsicon there; and exceedingly taken Iam with her singing, and\nbelieve she will do miracles at that and acting. Her little girl is\nmighty pretty and witty. After being there an hour, and I mightily\npleased with this evening’s work, we all parted; and I took coach\nand home, where late at my office and then home to enter my last\nthree days’ Journal; and so to supper and to bed — troubled at\n1. sc. before the Civil War.\n723\nnothing but that these pleasures do hinder me in my business, and\nthe more by reasonofour being to dine abroad tomorrow, and then\nSaturdy next is appointed to meet again at my Lord Brouncker’s\nlodgings and there to have the whole Quire of Italians. But then Ido\nconsider that this is all the pleasure I live for in the world, and the\ngreatest I can ever expect in the best of my life; and one thing more,\nthat by hearing this man tonight, and I think Capt. Cooke\ntomorrow and the Quire of Italians on Saturday, Ishall be truly able\nto distinguish which of them pleases me truly best, which I do\nmuch desire to know and have good reason and fresh occasion of\njudging."

Thence away by coach with Sir\nH. Cholmly and Fitzgerald and Creed, setting down the two\nlatter at the New Exchange; and H. Cholmly and I to the Temple\nand there walked in the dark in the walks, talking of news; and he\nsurprizes me with the certain news that the King did last night in\ncouncil declare his being in Treaty with the Dutch. God therefore\ngive a good end to it, for I doubt it; and yet do much more doubt\nthe issue of our continuing the war, for we are in no wise fit for\nit. And yet it troubles me to think what Sir H. Cholmly says,\nthat he believes they will not give us any reparation for what we\nhave suffered by the warr, nor put us into any better condition\nthen what we were in before the war, for that will be shameful\nfor us. Thence parted with him and home through the dark over\nthe ruins by coach, with my sword drawn, to my office, where\ndespatched some business; and so home to my chamber and to\nsupper and to bed. This morning came up to my wife’s bedside, I\nbeing up dressing myself, little Will Mercer to be her Valentine;\nand brought her name writ upon blue paper in gold letters, done\nby himself, very pretty — and we were both well pleased with it.\nBut I am also this year my wife’s Valentine, and it will cost me s/\n— but that I must have laid out if we had not been Valentines. So\nto bed.\n724.\n16 February 1667\n16. To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there was Sir Rob. Murray,\nwhom I never understood so well as now by this opportunity of\ndiscourse; he is a most excellent man of reason and learning, and\nunderstands the doctrine of Musique and everything else I could\ndiscourse of very finely. Here came Mr. Hooke, Sir George Ent,\nDr. Wren, and many others; and by and by the music, that is to say,\nSeignor Vincentio, who is the maister Composer, and six more,\nwhereof two Eunuches (so tall, that Sir T. Harvy said well that he\nbelieves they did grow large by being gelt, as our Oxen do) and one\nwoman, very well dressed and handsome enough but would not be\nkissed, as Mr. Killigrew, who brought the company in, did\nacquaint us. They sent two Harpsicons before; and by and by, after\ntuning them, they begun; and I confess, very good music they\nmade; that is, the composition exceeding good, but yet not at all\nmore pleasing to me then what I have heard in English by Mrs.\nKnipp, Capt. Cooke and others. Nor do I dote on the Eunuchs;\nthey sing endeed pretty high and have a mellow kind of sound, but\nyet I have been as well satisfied with several women’s voices, and\nmen also, as Crispe of the Wardrobe. The woman sung well, but\nthat which distinguishes all is this: that in singing, the words are to\nbe considered and how they are fitted with notes, and then the\ncommon accent of the country is to be known and understood by\nthe hearer, or he will never be a good judge of the vocall music of\nanother country. So that I was not taken with this at all, neither\nunderstanding the first nor by practice reconciled to the latter, so\nthat their motions and risings and fallings, though it may be\npleasing to an Italian or one that understands that tongue, yet to me\nit did not; but do from my heart believe that I could set words in\nEnglish, and make music of them, more agreeable to any\nEnglishman’s eare (the most judicious) then any Italian music set\nfor the voice and performed before the same man, unless he be\nacquainted with the Italian accent of speech. The composition as to\nthe Musique part was exceeding good, and their justness in keeping\ntime by practice much before any that we have, unless it be a good\nband of practised fiddlers.\nSo away; here being Capt. Cocke, with him stole away, leaving\nthem at it, in his coach; and to Mrs. Pierces, where I took up my\nwife and there find that Mrs. Pierce’s little girl is my Valentine, she\nhaving drawn me — which I was not sorry for, it easing me of\nsomething more that I must have given to others. But here Ido first\nobserve the fashion of drawing of Motto’s as well as names; so that\n725\nPierce, who drew my wife, did draw also a motto, and this girl\ndrew another for me. What mine was I have forgot; but my wife’s\nwas (Most virtuous and most fair); which, as it may be used, or an\nAnagram made upon each name, might be very pretty. Thence\nwith Cocke and my wife; set him at home, and then we home. To\nthe office and there dida\nlittle business, troubled that Ihave so much\nbeen hindered by matters of pleasure from my business; but I shall\nrecover it I hope ina little time. So home and to supper, not at all\nsmitten with the music tonight, which I did expect should have\nbeen so extraordinary, Tom Killigrew crying it up, and so all the\nworld, above all things in the world; and so to bed."

    "text": "Lords day. Up, and called at Michell’s and took him and his\nwife and carried them to Westminster, I landing at Whitehall and\nhaving no pleasure in the way con ella; and so to the Duke’s, where\nwe all met and had a hot encounter before the Duke of York about\nthe business of our payments at the Ticket Office; where we urged\nthat we had nothing to do to be troubled with the pay, having\nexamined the tickets. Besides, we are neglected, having not money\nsent us in time. But to see the baseness of my brethren, not a man\nalmost put in a word but Sir W. Coventry, though at the office like\nvery devils in this point. But I did plainly declare that without\nmoney no fleet could be expected, and desired the Duke of York to\ntake noticeof[it] and notice was taken of it — but I doubt will do no\ngood. But I desire to remember it as a most prodigious thing that to\nthis day my Lord Treasurer hath not consulted counsel (which Sir\nW. Coventry and I and others do think is necessary) about the late\nPole act, enough to put the same into such order as that anybody\ndare lend money upon it, though we have from this office under our\nhands related the necessity thereof to the Duke of York. Nor was\nlike to be determined in, for aught I see, a good while, had not Sir\nW. Coventry plainly said that he did believe it would be a better\nwork for the King then going to church this morning, to send for\nthe Atturny Generall to meet at the Lord Treasurer’s this afternoon\nand to bring the thing to an issue, saying that himself, were he\ngoing to the Sacrament, would not think he should offend God to\nleave it and go to the ending this work, so much it is of moment to\nthe King and Kingdom. Hereupon the Duke of York said he would\npresently speak to the King, and cause it to be done this afternoon.\nHaving done here, we broke up, having done nothing almost\nthough, for all this; and by and by I met Sir G. Carteret, and he is\n726\n17 February 1667\nstark mad at what hath passed this morning, andI believe is heartily\nvexed with me. I said little, but I am sure the King will suffer if\nsome better care be not taken then he takes to look after this\nbusiness of money. So parted, and I by water home and to dinner,\nW. Hewer with us; a good dinner and very merry, my wife and I;\nand after dinner, to my chamber to fit something against the\nCouncil anon; and that being done, away to Whitehall by water and\nthence to my Lord Chancellors, where I met with and had much\npretty discourse with one of the Progers’s that knows me. And it\nwas pretty to hear him tell me of his own accord, as a matter of no\nshame, that in Spain he had a pretty woman his mistress; whom,\nwhen money grew scarce with him, he was forced to leave, and\nafterward heard how she and her husband lived well, she being kept\nby an old Fryer who used her as his whore; but this, says he, is better\nthen as our Ministers do, who have wifes that lay up their estates\nand do no good nor relieve any poor; no, not our greatest prelates —\nand I think he is in the right for my part.\nStayed till the Council was up, and attended the King and Duke\nof York round the park and was asked several Questions by both;\nbut I was in pain lest they should ask me what I could not answer; as\nthe Duke of York did the value of the hull of the St. Patricke, lately\nlost; which I told him Icould not presently answer — though I might\nhave easily furnished myself to answer all those Questions. They\nstood a good while to see the ganders and geese tread one another in\nthe water, the goose being all the while kept for a great while quite\nunder water, which was new to me; but they did make mighty\nSport at it, saying (as the King did often), ““Now you shall see a\nmarriage between this and that” — which did not please me. They\ngone by coach to my Lord Treasurer’s, as the Duke of York told\nme, to settle the business of money for the Navy; I walked into the\nCourt to and again till night, and then met Coll. Reames and he and\nI walked together a great while, complaining ofthe ill-management\nof things, whereof he is as full as 1am. We run over many persons\nand things, and see nothing done like men like to do well while the\nKing minds his pleasures so much. We did bemoan it that nobody\nwould or had authority enough with the King to tell him how all\nthings go to wrack and will be lost. Then he andI parted, and I to\nWestminster to the Swan, and there stayed till Michell and his wife\ncame. Old Michell and his wife came to see me, and there we drank\nand laughedalittle; and then the young ones and I| took boat, it\nbeing fine moonshine. | did to my trouble see all the way that ella\n727\ndid get as close a su marido as ella could, and turn her manos away\nquando yo did endeavour take one de los — so that I had no pleasure\nat all con ella ce night. When we landed, I did take occasion to send\nhim back a the bateau while I did get un baiser or two, and would\nhave taken la by la hand; but ella did turn away, and quandoI said\n‘Shall I not tocar te?” answered “‘Yo no love touching”, ina\nslight\nmodo. I seemed not to take notice of it, but parted kindly et su\nmarido did andar with me almost a mi casa, and there parted; and so\nI home, troubled at this; but I think I shall make good useof it and\nmind my business more. This evening, going to the Queen’s side to\nsee the ladies, I did find the Queene, the Duchess of York, and\nanother or two at Cards, with the room full of great ladies and men\n— which I was amazed at to see on a Sunday, having not believed it;\nbut contrarily, flatly denied the same a little while since to my\nCosen Roger Pepys. I did this day, going by water, read the\nAnswer to the Apology for Papists, which did like me mightily, it\nbeing a thing as well writ as I think most things that ever I read in\nmy life, and glad I am thatI read it."

We have discharged\nourselfs in this letter fully from blame in the bad success of the Navy\nifmoney do not come soon to us—and so my heart is at pretty good\nrest in this point. Having done here, Sir W.

In the afternoon\naway to Whitehall by water, and took a turn or two in the park and\nthen back to Whitehall; and there meeting my Lord Arlington, he,\nby Iknow not what kindness, offered to carry me along with him to\nmy Lord Treasurer’s, whither I told him I was going. I believe he\nhad a mind to discourse of some Navy business; but Sir Tho.\nClifford coming into the coach to us, we were prevented; which I\nwas sorry for, for | had a mind to begin an acquaintance with him.\nHe speaks well and hath pretty slight superficial parts, I believe. He\nin our going talked much of the plain habit of the Spaniards; how\nthe King and lords themselfs wear but a cloak of Colchester bayze,\nand the ladies mantles, in cold weather, of white flannel. And that\nthe endeavours frequently of setting up the manufacture of making\nthese stuffs there have only been prevented by the Inquisition — the\nEnglish and Duchmen that have been sent for to work being taken\nwith a Psalm-book or Testament, and so clapped up and the house\npulled down by the Inquisitors, and the greatest lord in Spain dare\nnot say a word against it — if the word “Inquisition” be but\nmentioned. At my Lord Treasurers light and parted with them,\nthey going into Council, and I walked with Capt. Cocke, who did\ntell me that the Duch are in very great straits, so as to be said to be\nnot able to set out their fleet this year.\nBy and by comes Sir Robt. Viner and Lord Mayor to ask the\nKing’s direction about measuring out the streets according to the\nnew Act for building of the City, wherein the King is to be pleased.\n730\nBut he says that the way proposed in Parliament by Coll. Birch\nwould have been the best, to have chosen some persons in trust and\nsold the whole ground, and let it be sold again by them with\npreference to the old owner; which would have certainly caused the\nCity to be built where these trustees pleased; whereas now, great\ndifferences will be and the streets built by fits, and not entire till all\ndifferences be decided. This, as he tells it, I think would have been\nthe best way. I enquired about the Frenchman! that was said to fire\nthe City, and was hanged for it by his own confession that he was\nhired for it by a Frenchman of Roane, and that he did witha stick\nreach in a Fireball in at a window of the house— whereas the maister\nof the house, who is the King’s Baker, and his son and daughter do\nall swear there was no such window —and that the fire did not begin\nthereabouts. Asking Sir R. Viner what he thought was the cause of\nthe fire, he tells me that the Baker, son and his daughter did all\nswear again and again that their Oven was drawn by 10 a-clock at\nnight. That having occasion to light a candle about 12, there was\nnot so much fire in the bakehouse as to light a match for a candle, so\nas they were fain to go into another place to light it. That about 2 in\nthe morning they felt themselfs almost choked with smoke; and\nrising, did find the fire coming upstairs — so they rose to save\nthemselfs; but that at that time the bavins were not on fire in the\nyard. So that they are, as they swear, in absolute ignorance how this\nfire should come — which isa strange thing, that so horrid an effect\nshould have so mean and uncertain a beginning. By and by called in\nto the King and Cabinet and there had a few insipid words about\nmoney for Tanger, but to no purpose. Thence away, walked to my\nboat at Whitehall, and so home and to supper; and so to my Journall\nand to bed.\nThis night, going through bridge by water, my waterman told\nme how the mistress of the Beare tavern at the bridge foot did\nlately fling herself into the Thames and drownded herself; which\ndid trouble me the more when they tell me it was she that did live\nat the White Horse tavern in Lumbard street; which was a most\nbeautiful woman, as most I have seen.

Downing’s, who is\n732\ntheir countryman — in inviting some poor people at Christmas last,\nto charm the country people’s mouths; but did give them nothing\nbut beef porridge, pudding, and pork, and nothing said all dinner,\nbut only his mother would say, “‘It’s good broth, son.”” He would\nanswer, ‘Yes, it is good broth.” Then his lady confirm all and say,\n“Yes, very good broth.” By and by she would begin and say,\n“Good pork;” “Yes,” says the mother, ‘“‘good pork.’”’ Then he\ncries, “Yes, very good pork.” And so they said of all things; to\nwhich nobody made any answer, they going there not out of love\nor esteem of them, but to eat his victuals, knowing him to be a\nniggardly fellow — and with this he is jeered now all over the\ncountry. After dinner with my wife by coach abroad, and set Mr.\nHunt down at the Temple and her at her brother’s. And I to\nWhitehall to meet W. Coventry, but found him not. But met Mr.\nCooling, who tells me of my Lord Duke of Buckingham’s being\nsent for last night by a Serjeant-at-armes to the Tower for\ntreasonable practices; and that the King is infinitely angry with him\nand declared him no longer one of his Council — I know not the\nreason of it, or occasion. To Westminster hall and there paid what I\nowed for books; and so by coach took up my wife to the Exchange\nand there bought things for Mr. Pierces little daughter, my\nValentine; and so to their house, where we find Knipp, who also\nchallengeth me for her valentine. She looks well, sang well, and\nvery merry we were for half an hour. Tells me Harris is well again,\nhaving been very ill. And so we home andIto the office. So late\nhome and to bed."

He came\nto town this day; and brings word that being overtaken and outridd\nby the Duchess of Buckingham, within a few miles of the Duke’s\nhouse of Westthorp he believes, she got thither about a quarter of an\nhour before him and so had time to consider — so that when he\ncame, the doors were kept shut against him. The next day, coming\nwith officers of the neighbour market-town to force open the\ndoors, they were open for him, but the Duke of Buckingham gone;\nso he took horse presently, and heard upon the road that the Duke\nof Buckingham was gone before him for London; so that he\nbelieves he is this day also come to town before him — but no news is\nyet heard of him. This is all he brings. Thence to my Lord\nChancellor; and there meeting Sir H.

He tells me that this silly Lord hath provoked, by his\nill-carriage, the Duke of York, my lord Chancellor, and all the great\npersons, and therefore most likely will die. He tells me too, many\npractices of treachery against this King; as betraying him in\nScotland and giving Oliver an account of the King’s private\ncouncils; which the King knows very well and yet hath pardoned\nhim.

But when my belly was full, was friends again, and\ndined and then by water down to Greenwich and thence walked to\nWoolwich, all the way reading Playfords Introduction to Musique,\nwherein are some things very pretty. At Woolwich I did much\nbusiness, taking an account of the state of the ships there under\nhand; thence to Blackewall and did the like for two ships we have\nrepairing there; and then to Deptford and did the like there; and so\nhome, Capt. Perriman with me from Deptford, telling me many\nperticulars how the King’s business is ill ordered; and indeed so they\nare, God knows. So home and to the office, where did business; and\nso home to my chamber, and then to supper and to bed."

But it comes into my mind here to observe what I\nhave heard from Sir Jo. Bankes (though I cannot fully conceive the\nreason of it): that it will be impossible to make the Exchequer ever a\ntrue bank to all intents, unless the Exchequer stood nearer the\nExchange, where merchants might with ease, while they are going\nabout their business, at all hours and without trouble or loss of\ntime, have their satisfaction; which they cannot have now with[out]\nmuch trouble and loss of halfa day, and no certainty of having the\noffices open. By this, he means a bank for common practice and use\nof merchants, and therein I do agree with him. Being parted from\nSir W. Penn,and G. Downing, I to Westminster hall and there met\nBalty, whom I had sent for; and there did break the business of my\ngetting him the place of going again as Muster-maister with\nHarman this voyage to the West Indys; which endeed I do owe to\nSir W. Penn. He is mighty glad of it and earnest to fit himself for it;\nbut I do find, poor man, that he is troubled how to dispose of his\nwife, and apparently it is out of fear of her and his honour, and |\nbelieve he hath received some cause of this his jealousy and care.\nAnd I\ndo pity him in it, and will endeavour to find out some way to\ndo it for him. Having put him in a wayofpreparing himself for the\nvoyage, I did go to the Swan; and there sent for Jervas my old\nperiwig-maker and he did bring mea periwig; but it was full of nits,\nso as I was troubled to see it (it being his old fault) and did send him\nto make it clean; and in the meantime, having stayed for him a good\nwhile, did go away by water and to the Castle Taverne by Exeter\nhouse and there met W. Batten, W. Penn and several others; among\nthe rest, Sir Ellis Layton, who doth apply himself to discourse with\nme; and Ithink by his discourse, out of his opinion of my interest in\nSir W. Coventry. The manI find a wonderful witty, ready man for\nsudden answers and little tales and sayings very extraordinary\nwitty; but in the bottom, I doubt he is not so. Yet he pretends to\nhave studied men; and the truth is, in several that I do know he did\ngive me a very inward account of them.\nSo I home, and there up to my wife in our chamber; and there\nreceived from my brother the news of my mother’s dying on\nMonday, about 5 or 6 a-clock in the afternoon, and that the last time\nshe spoke of her children was on Friday last, and her last words was,\n“God bless my poor Sam!”’ The reading thereof did set me a-\nweeping heartily; and so, weeping to myself a while and my wife\n746\nalso to herself — I then spoke to my wife, recollecting myself, and\nendeed having some thoughts how much better, both for her and\nus, it is then it might have been had she outlived my father and me\nor my happy present condition in the world, she being helpless, I\nwas the sooner at ease in my mind; and then found it necessary to go\nabroad with my wife to look after the providing mourning to send\ninto the country, some tomorrow and more against Sundy, for my\nfamily, being resolved to put myself and wife, and Barker andJane,\nW. Hewers and Tom, in mourning; and my two under-maids, to\ngive them hoods and scarfs and gloves.

Coventry; and meeting Balty\nat my house, I took him with me by water, and to the Duke of\nAlbemarle to give him an account of that business; which was the\nshipping off of some soldiers for the manning of the few ships now\ngoing out, with Harman to the West Indies; which is a sad\nconsideration, that at the very beginning of the year, and few ships\nabroad, we should be in such want of men; but they do hide\nthemselfs and swear they will not go to be killed and have no pay. I\nfind the Duke of Albemarle at dinner with sorry company, some of\nhis officers of the Army — dirty dishes and a nasty wife at table—and\nbad meat; of which I made but an ill dinner. Pretty, to hear how she\ntalked against Capt. Du Tel, the Frenchman that the Prince and her\nhusband put out last year; and how, says she, the Duke of York hath\nmade for his good services his cup-bearer; yet fired more shot into\nthe Prince’s ship, and others of the King’s ships, then of the enemy.'\nAnd the Duke of Albemarle did confirm it, and that somebody\nin the fight did cry out that a little Dutchman by his ship did plague\nhim more then any other; upon which they were going to order him\nto be sunk, when they looked and found it was Du Tell, who, as the\nDuke of Albemarle says, had killed several men in several of our\nships. He said, but for his interest which he knew hehad at Court,\nhe had hanged him at the yard’s arm without staying for a Court\nMartiall. My Lady Duchesse, among other things, discoursed of\nthe wisdom of dividing the fleet; which the Generall said nothing\nto, though he knows well that it come from themselfs in the fleet\nand was brought up hither by Sir Edw. Spragge. One at the table\ntold an odd passage in this late plague: that at Petersfield (Ithink he\nsaid) one side of the street had every house almost infected through\nthe town; and the other, net one shut up. Dinner being done, I\nbrought Balty to the Duke of Albemarle to kiss his hands and thank\nhim for his kindness the last year to him and take leave of him. And\n1. In the Four Days Battle.\n759\n4 April 1667\nthen Balty and I to walk in the park; and out of pity to his father,\ntold him what I had in my thoughts to do for him about the money\n— that is, to make him Deputy-Treasurer of the fleet, which I have\ndone by getting Sir G. Carteret’s consent and an order from the\nDuke of York for 1500l to be paid to him. He promises the whole\nprofit to be paid to my wife, for to be disposed on as she sees fit for\nher father and mother’s relief. So, mightily pleased with our walk,\nit being mighty pleasant weather, I back to Sir G. Carteret’s and\nthere he had newly dined; and talked and find that he doth give\neverything over for lost, declaring no money to be raised. I made\nhim merry with telling him how many land-Admiralls we are to\nhave this year — Allen at Plymouth, Holmes at Portsmouth, Spragg\nfor Medway, Teddyman at Dover, Smith to the North, and\nHarman to the South. Mightily pleased Iam with his family; and\nmy Lady Carteret was on the bed today, having been let blood, and\ntells me of my Lady Jem’s being big-bellied.\nThence with him to Lord Treasurer’s, and there walked during\nCouncil-sitting with Sir St. Fox, talking of the sad condition of the\nKing’s purse, and affairs thereby — and how sad the King’s life must\nbe, to pass by his officers every hour that are four years behindhand\nunpaid. Here I spoke with Sir W. Coventry, who tells me plainly\nthat to all future complaints of lack of money he will answer but\nwith a shrugg of his shoulder; which methought did come to my\nheart, to see him to begin to abandon the King’s affairs and let them\nsink or swim, so he do his own part; which I confess I believe he\ndoth, beyond any officer the King hath; but unless he do endeavour\nto make others do theirs, nothing will be done. The consideration\nhereof did make me go away very sad; and so home by coach and\nthere took up my wife and Mercer (who had been today at\nWhitehall to the Maundy, it being Maundy Thursday; but the King\ndid not wash the poor people’s feet himself, but the Bishop of\nLondon did it for him; but I did not see it) and with them took up\nMrs. Anne Jones at her mother’s door; and so to take the ayre to\nHackny, where good neat’s tongue and things to eat and drink, and\nvery merry, the weather being mighty pleasant; and here I was told\nthat at their church they have a fair pair of Organs, which plays\nwhile the people sing; which I am mighty glad of, wishing the like\nat our church at London, and would give sol towards it.

From him to\nMargaret Church, and there spied Martin and home with her, who\nhad those, so could have ninguno placer; but fell out to see her\nexpensefulness, having bought Turkey work chairs &c; by and by\naway home, and there took out my wife and the two Mercers and\ntwo of ur maids, Barker and Jane, and over the water to the Jamaica\nhouse, where I never was before; and there the girls did run for\nwagers over the bowling-green. And there with much pleasure,\nspent little, and so home; and they home, and I read with\nsatisfaction in my book of Turky and so to bed."

That it is not in his\nnature to gainsay anything that relates to his pleasures. That much\nof it arises from the sickliness of our Ministers of State, who cannot\nbe about him as the idle companions are, and therefore give way to\nthe young rogues; and then from the negligence of the Clergy, that\na Bishop shall never be seen about him, as the King of France hath\nalways. He tells me mighty stories of the King of France, how great\na prince he is. He hath made a Code to shorten the law. He hath put\nout all the ancient commanders of castles that were become\nhereditary. He hath made all the Fryers subject to the Bishops,\nwhich before were only subject to Rome and so were hardly the\nKing’s subjects. And that none shall become religious* but at such\nan age — which he thinks will in few years ruin the pope and bring\nFrance into a patriarchate. He confirmed to me the business of the\nwant of paper at the Council table the other day, which I have\nobserved — Wooly being to have found it, and did, being called, tell\nthe King to his face the reason of it. And Mr. Eveling tells me that\nseveral of the menial servants of the Court lack bread, that have not\nreceived a farding wages since the King’s coming in. He tells me the\nKing of France hath his Maistresses, but laughs at the foolery ofour\nKing, that makes his bastards princes, and loses his revenue upon\nthem — and makes his mistresses his maisters. And the King of\nFrance did never grant Lavaliere anything to bestow on others; and\ngives a little subsistence, but no more, to his bastards.\nBy and by we discoursed of Sir Tho. Clifford, whom I took fora\nvery rich and learned man, andofthe great family of that name. He\ntells me he is only a man of about seven-score pound a year\n—oflittle\nlearning, more then the law of a Justice of Peace, which he knows\nwell—a parson’s son, got to be Burges ina little borough in the West\nand there fell into the acquaintance of my Lord Arlington, whose\ncreature he is and never from him. A man of virtue, and comely and\ngood parts enough; and hath come into his place witha great grace,\nthough with a great skip over the heads of\na great many, as Chichly\nand Dunkum and some Lords that did expect it. By the way he tells\nme that of all the great men of England, there is none that\nendeavours more to raise those that he takes into favour then my\nLord Arlington; and that on that score, he is much more to be made\none’s patron then my Lord Chancellor, who never did nor will do\nanything but for money.

Then to\nthe office, where all the afternoon very busy; and in the evening,\nweary home; and there to sing, but vexed with the unreadiness of\nthe girl’s voice to learn the latter part of my song,’ though I confess\nit is very hard half-notes. So to supper and to bed.\n3. Up and with Sir W. Batten to Whitehall to Sir W. Coventry’s\nchamber, and there did receive the Duke’s order for Balty’s\n1. It is decreed.\n748\n3 April 1667\nreceiving of the contingent money to be paymaister of it; and it\npleases me the more for that it is but 1500/, which will be butalittle\nsum for to try his ability and honesty in the disposing of— and so I\nam the willinger to trust him and pass my word for him therein. By\nand by up to the Duke of York, where our usual business; and\namong other things, I read two most dismal lettersof the straits we\nare in (from Coll. Middleton and Comissioner Taylor) that ever\nwere writ in the world, so as the Duke of York would have them to\nshow the King. And to every demand of money, whereof we\nproposed many and very pressing ones, Sir G. Carteret could make\nno answer but “No money’’, which I confess made me almost\nready to cry for sorrow and vexation; but that which was the most\nconsiderable was when Sir G. Carteret did say that he had no fond\nto raise money on; and being asked by Sir W. Coventry whether the\nEleven Months Tax was not a fond, and he answered no — that the\nbanquiers would not lend money upon it. Thence to the chapel, and\nthere by chance hear that Dr. Crew is to preach; and so into the\nOrgan loft, where I met Mr. Carteret and my Lady Jemimah and\nSir Tho. Crew’s two daughters, and Dr. Childe played — and Dr.\nCrew did make a very pretty, neat, sober, honest sermon; and\ndelivered it very readily, decently, and gravely, beyond his years —\nso as I was exceedingly taken with it, and I believe the whole chapel\n— he being but young; but his manner of his delivery I do like\nexceedingly. His text was, ““But first seeke the kingdom of God and\nall these things shall be added unto you.”’ Thence with my Lady to\nSir G. Carteret’s lodgings, and so up into the house and there do\nhear that the Dutch letters are come and say that the Dutch have\nordered a passe to be sent for our Commissioners; and that it is now\nupon the way, coming with a Trumpeter, blinded as is usual. But I\nperceive everybody begins to doubt the success of the treaty, all\ntheir hopes being only that if it can be had on any terms, the\nChancellor will have it; for he dare not come before a Parliament,\nnor a great many more of the Courtiers, and the King himself doth\ndeclare he doth not desire it, nor entend it but on a strait — which\nGod defend him from. Here I hear how the King is not so well\npleased of this marriage between the Duke of Richmond and Mrs.\nStewart as is talked; and that he by a wilde did fetch her to the Beare\nat the Bridge foot, where a coach was ready, and they are stole away\ninto Kent without the King’s leave; and that the King hath said he\nwill never see her more, but people do think that it is onlya trick.\nThis day I saw Prince Rupert abroad in the Vane Roome, pretty\n749\nwell as he used to be, and looks as well; only, something appears to\nbe under his periwig on the crown of his head."

So we had gloves and wine and wafers,\nvery pretty, and talked and tattled; and so we away by water and up\nwith the tide, she and I and Barker, as high as Barne Elmes, it being\na fine evening; and back again to pass the bridge at standing-water\nbetween 9 and 10 at night; and then home and to supper, and then to\nbed with much pleasure.

Hewers for his good,\nbut do believe he will not part with me, nor have I any mind to let\nhim go. I would my brother were fit for it; I would adventure him\nthere. He insists upon an unmarried man — that can write well— and\nhath French enough to transcribe it only from a copy, and may\nwrite shorthand if it may be. Thence with him to my Lord\nChancellors at Clarendon house to a Committee for Tanger, where\nseveral things spoke of and proceeded on; and perticularly sending\nCommissioners’ thither before the new Governor goes, which I\nthink will signify as much good as everything else that hath been\ndone about the place; which is, none at all. Mightily pleased with\nthe nobleness of this house and the brave furniture and pictures,\nwhich endeed is very noble. And being broke up, I with Sir G.\nCarteret in his coach into Hyde park to discourse of things, and\nspent an hour in this manner with great pleasure; telling me all his\nconcernments, and how he is gone through with the purchase for\nmy Lady Jemimah and her husband. How the Treasury is like to\ncome into the hands of a committee; but that not that, nor anything\nelse, will do our business, unless the King himself will mind his\nbusiness; and how his servants do execute their parts. He doth fear\nan utter ruin in the state, and that ina\nlittle time, if the King do not\n1. To reorganise the garrison.\n768\nmind his business soon. That the King is very kind to him and to\nmy Lord Sandwich; and that he doubts not but at his coming home,\nwhich he expects about Michaelmas, he will be very well received.\nBut it is pretty strange how he begun again the business of the\nintention of\na marriage of my Lord Hinchingbrooke to a daughter\nof my Lord Burlington’s to my Lord Chancellor; which he now\ntells me as a great secret, when he told it me the last Sunday but one.\nBut it may be the poor man hath forgot, and I do believe he doth\nmake it a secret, he telling me that he hath not told it to any but\nmyself, and this day to his daughter my Lady Jemimah— who looks\nto lie down about two months hence. After all this discourse, we\nturned back and to Whitehall, where we parted; and I took up my\nwife at Unthankes and so home; and in our street, at the Three Tuns\ntavern door, find a great hubbub, and what was [it] but two\nbrothers have fallen out and one killed the other; and who should\nthey be but the two Fieldings, one whereof, Bazill, was page to my\nLady Sandwich; and he hath killed the other, himself being very\ndrunk, and so is sent to Newgate. I to the office and did as much\nbusiness as my eyes would let me, and so home to supper and to\nbed."

As to my Lord Brouncker, she says how Mrs. Griffin,\nour housekeeper’s wife, hath it from his maid, that comes to her\nhouse often, that they are very poor; that the other day Mrs.\nWilliams was fain to send a jewell to pawn. That they have a most\nlewd and nasty family here in the office; but Mrs. Turner doth tell\nme that my Lord hath put the King to infinite charge since his\ncoming thither, in alterations; and perticularly, that Mr. Harper at\nDeptford did himself tell her that my Lord hath had of Foly the\nironmonger $o/-worth in locks and keys for his house, and that it is\nfrom the fineness of them, having some of 4 and 5/ a lock, such as is\nin ladies closets; that he hath several of these. That Mrs. Griffin doth\nsay that he doth not keep Mrs. Williams now for love, but need, he\nhaving another whore that he keeps in Covent garden. That they do\nowe money everywhere, almost for everything; even Mrs. Ship-\nman for her butter and cheese about 3/, and after many demands\ncannot get it.\nThen we fall to talk of Sir W. Penn and his family and rise. She\n774\nsays that he was apitiful [fellow] when she first knew them. That\nhis lady was one of the sorriest, dirty women that ever she saw.\nThat his rise hath been his giving of large Bribes, wherein (and she\nagrees with my opinion and knowledge before therein) he is very\nprofuse. That long ago endeed, he would drink the King’s health\nprivately with Mr. Turner; but that when he saw it fit to turn\nRoundhead, and was offered by Mr. Turner to drink the King’s\nhealth, he answered no, he was changed, and now he that would\nmake him drink the King’s health, or any health but the Protectors\nand the State’s (or to that purpose), he would be the first man\nshould sheath his sword in his guts. That at the King’s coming in,\nhe did send for her husband and told him what a great man Sir W.\nCoventry was like to be; and that he having all the records in his\nhands of the Navy, ifhe would transcribe what was of most present\nuse of the practice of the Navy, and give them him to give Sir W.\nCoventry from him, it would undoubtedly do his business of\ngetting him a Principal Officer’s place. That he was the last war a\nmost devilish plunderer, and that got him his estate which he hath\nin Ireland, and nothing else; and that he hath always been a very\nliberal man in his bribes. That upon his coming into this part of the\nController’s business wherein he is, he did send for T. Willson and\ntold him how against his knowledge he was put in, and had so little\nwit as to say to him, “This will make the pot boyle, will it not, Mr.\nWillson? will it not make the pot boil?” and doth offer him to come\nin and do his business for him, and he would reward him. Upon the\nwhole, she told me stories enough to confirm me that he is the most\nfalse fellow that ever was born of woman, and that so she thinks and\nknows him to be."

Clifford; at which he says all the whole\nCourt is disturbed, it having been once concluded otherwise, but all\nofa sudden the King’s choice was changed, and these are to be the\nmen; the first of which is only for a puppet to give honour to the\nrest. He doth presage that these men will make it their business to\nfind faults in the management of the late Lord Treasurer and in\ndiscouraging the banquiers; but I am (whatever I in compliance do\nsay to him) of another mind, and my heart is very gladofit; for Ido\nexpect they will do much good, and that it is the happiest thing that\n775\n1667 22 May\nhath appeared to me for the good of the nation since the King came\nin. Thence to St. James’s and up to the Duke of York; and there in\nhis chamber Sir W.

So into the Duke of York’s closet; and there, among\nother things, Sir W. Coventry did take notice of what he told me\nthe other day, about a report of Comissioner Pett’s dealing for\ntimber in the Navy and selling it to us in other names; and besides\nhis own proof did produce a paper I had given him this morning\nabout it, in the case of Widow Murford and Morecocke — which\nwas so handled, that the Duke of York grew very angry, and\ncommanded us presently to fall into the examination of it, saying\nthat he would [not] trust a man for his sake that lifts up the whites of\nhis eyes. And it was declared that if he be found to have done so, he\nshould be reckoned unfit to serve the Navy. AndIdo believe he will\nbe turned out; and it was methought, a worthy saying of W.\nCoventry to the Duke of York —“‘Sir,”’ says he, “I do not make this\ncomplaint out of any disrespect to Comissioner Pett, but because I\ndo love to do these things fairly and openly.”\nAnd so home; and by and by comes my poor father, much better\nthen I expected, being at ease by fits, according as his truss sits, and\nanother time in as much pain. I am mighty glad to see him come\nwell to town. So to dinner, where Creed comes. After dinner, my\nwife and father abroad; and Creed and I also by water, and parted at\nthe Temple stairs; where I landed and to the King’s house, where I\ndid give 18d. and saw the two last acts of The Goblins, a play I could\nnot make anything of by those two acts; but here Knipp spied me\nout of the tiring-room and came to the pit door: and I out to her and\nkissed her, she only coming to see me, being in a country-dress, she\nand others having it seemed had a country-dance in the play, but she\nno other part; so we parted, and I into the pit again till it was done.\nThe house full, but I had no mind to be seen; but thence to my\ncutler’s and two or three other places on small errands; and so\nhome, where my father and wife come home; and pretty well, my\nfather, who to supper and betimes to bed at his country hours.\n776\n26 May 1667\n26.

Up sooner then usual on Sundays, and to walk, it\nbeing exceeding hot all night (so as this night Ibegin to leave offmy\nwaistcoat this year) and this morning; and so to walk in the garden\ntill toward church time, when my wife and I to church; where\nseveral strangers of good condition came to our pew, where the\npew was full. At noon dined at home, where little Michell came,\nand his wife, who continues mighty pretty. After dinner, Iby water\nalone to Westminster, where not finding Mrs. Martin within, did\ngo toward the parish church and in the way did overtake her, who\nresolved to go into the church with her that she was going with\n(Mrs. Hargrave, the little crooked woman, the vintner’s wife of the\nDog) and then go out again; and so I to the church; and seeing her\nreturn, did go to go out again myself, but met with Mr. Howlett,\nwho offering me a pew in the gallery, I had no excuse but up with\nhim I must go, and there, much against my will, stayed out the\nwhole church in pain, while she expected me at home; but I did\nentertain myself with my perspective glass up and down the\nchurch, by which I had the greatest pleasure of seeing and gazing a\ngreat many very fine women; and what with that and sleeping, I\npassed away the time till sermon was done; and then to Mrs. Martin\nand there stayed with her an hour or two, and there did what jo\nwould with her. And after having been here so long, I away to my\nboat, and up with it as far as Barne Elmes, reading of Mr. Eveling’s\nlate new book against Solitude, in which I do not find much excess\nof good matter, though it be pretty for a by-discourse. I walked the\nlength of the Elmes, and with great pleasure saw some gallant ladies\nand people, come with their bottles and basket[s] and chairs and\nforms|[s] to sup under the trees by the waterside, which was mighty\npleasant. I to boat again and to my book; and having done that, I\ntook another book, Mr. Boyles of Colours, and there read where |\nleft, finding many fine things worthy observation. And so landed at\nthe Old Swan and so home, where I find my poor father newly\ncome out of an unexpected fit of his pain, that they feared he would\nhave died. They had sent for me to Whitehall and all up and down,\nand for Mr. Holliard also, who did come. But W. Hewers being\nhere did I think do the business, in getting my father’s bowel, that\nwas fallen down, into his body again. But above all things, the poor\nman’s patience under it, and his good heart and humour as soon as\nhe was out ofit, did so work upon me, that my heart was sad to\nthink of his condition; but do hope that a way will be found by a\nsteele truss to relieve him. By and by to supper, all our discourse\nee\nabout Brampton, and my intentions to build there ifI could be free\nof my engagement to my Uncle Tho. and his son, that they may not\nhave what I have built, against my will, to them, whether I will or\nno, in case of my and my brothers being without heirs males —\nwhich is the true reason why I am against laying out money upon\nthat place, together with my fear of some inconvenience by being\nso near Hinchingbrooke; being obliged to be a servant to that\nfamily, and subject to what expenses they shall cost me, and to have\nall that I shall buy or do esteemed as got by the death of my Uncle;\nwhen endeed, what I have from him is not worth naming.

Presently comes Creed, and he and Iby water\nto Foxhall and there walked in Spring garden; a great deal of\ncompany, and the weather and garden pleasant; that it is very\npleasant and cheap going thither, for a man may go to spend what\nhe will, or nothing, all as one— but to hear the nightingale and other\nbirds, and here fiddles and there a harp, and here a jews trump, and\nhere laughing, and there fine people walking, is mighty divertising.\nAmong others, there were two pretty women alone, that walked a\ngreat while; which [being] discovered by some idle gentlemen, they\nwould needs take them up; but to see the poor ladies, how they\nwere put to it to run from them, and they after them; and\nsometimes the ladies put themselfs along with other company, then\nthe others drew back; at last, the ladies did get off out of the house\nand took boat and away. I was troubled to see them abused so; and\ncould have found my heart, as little desire of fighting as I have, to\nhave protected the ladies. So by water; set Creed down at\nWhitehall, and I to Old Swan and so home. My father gone to bed\nand wife abroad at Woolwich, I to Sir W. Penn, where he and his\nLady and Pegg, and pretty Mrs. Lowther, her sister-in-law, at\nsupper; where I sat and talked, and Sir W. Penn, half drunk, did talk\nlike a fool and vex his wife, that I was half pleased and half vexed to\nsee so much folly and rudeness from him; and so late home to bed."

Coventry a\ngreat while, talking about several businesses — but especially about\naccounts and how backward our Treasurer is in giving them\nsatisfaction; and the truth is, Ido doubt he cannot do better. But it is\nstrange to see, that being conscious of our doing little at this day nor\nfor some time past in our office, for want of money, I do hang my\nhead to him and cannot be so free with him as I used to be, nor can\nbe free with him, though of all men I think I have the least cause to\nbe so, having taken so much more pains (while I could do anything)\nthen the rest of my fellows. Parted with him; and so going through\nthe park, met Mr. Mills our parson, whom I went back with to\nbring him to W. Coventry to give him the form of a Qualificacion\nfor the Duke of York to sign to, to enable him to have two livings;\nwhich was a service I did, but much against my will, fora lazy, fat\npriest. Thence to Westminster hall and there walked a turn or two\nwith Sir Wm. Doyly, who did lay a wager with me the Treasurer-\nship would be in one hand (notwithstanding this present Com-\nmission) before Christmas; on which we did lay a pole of ling, a\nbrace of carps, and a pottle of wine, and Sir W. Penn and Mr.\nScowen to be at the eating of them. Thence down by water to\nDeptford, it being Trinity Monday, when the Maister is chosen.\nAnd there finding them all at church, and thinking they dined as\nusual at Stepny, I turned back, having a good book in my hand (the\nLife of Cardinal Wolsey, wrote by his own servant), and to\nRatcliffe; and so walked to Stepny and spent my time in the\nchurchyard looking over the gravestones, expecting when the\ncompany would come; but finding no company stirring, I sent to\nthe house to see, and it seems they dine not there, but at Deptford;\nso I back again to Deptford and there find them just sat down; and\nso I down with them and we had a good dinner of plain meat, and a\ngood company at our Table; among others, my good Mr. Evelyn,\nwith whom after dinner I stepped aside and talked upon the present\nposture of our affairs; which is, that the Dutch are known to be\nabroad with 80 sail of ships of war and 20 fireships and the French\ncome into the Channell with 20 sail of men-of-war and5\nfireships,\nwhile we have not a ship at sea to do them any hurt with, but are\ncalling in all we can, while our Imbassadors are treating at Bredah\nand the Duch look upon them as come to beg peace, and use them\naccordingly. And all this through the negligence of our Prince; who\n782\nhath power, if he would, to maister all these with the money and\nmen that he hath had the command of, and may now have if he\nwould mind his business. But for [aught] we see, the Kingdom is\nlikely to be lost, as well as the reputation of it is, for ever —\nnotwithstanding so much reputation got and preserved by a Rebell\nthat went before him.\nThis discourse of ours ended with sorrowful reflections upon our\ncondition, and so broke up; and Creed andI got out of the room and\naway by water to Whitehall, and there he and I waited in the\nTreasury chamber. By and by, I upon desire was called in and\ndelivered in my report of my accounts: present, Lord Ashly,\nClifford, and Duncomb; who being busy, did not read it but\ncommitted it to Sir G. Downing, and so I was dismissed. But Lord,\nto see how Duncomb doth take upon him is an eysore, though I\nthink he deserves great honour; but only, the suddenness of his rise\nand his pride. But I do like the wayof these Lords, that they admit\nnobody to use many words; nor do they spend many words\nthemselfs, but in great state do hear what they see necessary, and\nsay little themselfs but bid withdraw. Thence Creed and I by water\nup to Foxhall; and over against it stopped, thinking to see some\ncock-fighting, but it was just being done; and therefore back again\nto the other side and to Spring garden and there eat and drank a\nlittle; and then to walk up and down the garden, reflecting upon the\nbad management of things now compared with what it was in the\nlate rebellious times, when men, some for fear and some for\nreligion, minded their business; which none now do, by being void\n~ of both. Much talk of this and other kinds, very pleasant; and so\nwhen it was almost night, we home, setting him in at Whitehall, Ito\n[the] Old Swan; and thence home, where to supper and then to read\na little; and so to bed."

Yet I\ndo not find the Duke of Albemarle entends to go thither, but stays\nhere tonight and hath (though the Dutch are gone) ordered our\nfrigates to be brought in a line between the two block-houses! —\nwhich I took then to be a ridiculous thing.

Griffen [told me] that last night there was not\ntwelve men to be got in the town to defend it — which the master of\nthe house tells mie is not true; but that the men of the town did\nentend to stay, though they did endeed, and so had he (at the Ship),\nremoved their goods. Thence went off to an Ostend man-of-war,\nJust now come up, who met the Dutch fleet, who took three ships\nthat he came convoying hither from him — says they are as low as\nthe Nore or thereabouts. So I homeward, as long as it was light\nreading Mr. Boyles book of Hydrostatickes, which is a most\nexcellent book as ever I read; and I will take much pains to\n1.

By and by, after dinner, my wife out by\n786\n12 June 1667\ncoach to see her mother; and I in another (being afeared at this busy\ntime to be seen with a woman in a coach, as if I were idle) toward\nThe[oph]. Turners; but met Sir W. Coventry’s boy, and there in his\nletter find that the Dutch had made no motion since their taking\nSherenesse; and the Duke of Albemarle writes that all is safe as to\nthe great ships against any assault — the boom and Chaine' being so\nfortified; which put my heart into great joy. When I came to Sir W.\nCoventry’s chamber, I find him abroad; but his clerk Powell doth\ntell me that ill news is come to Court of the Dutch breaking the\nChaine at Chatham, which struck me to the heart, and to Whitehall\nto hear the truth of it; and there, going up the park stairs, I did hear\nsome lackeys speaking of sad news come to Court, saying that\nhardly anybody in the court but doth look as if they cried; and\nwould not go into the house for fear of being seen, but slunk out and\ngot into a coach, and to The[oph]. Turner to Sir W. Turner’s,\nwhere I met Roger Pepys, newly come out of the country (he and I\ntalked aside a little, he offering a match for Pall, one Barnes, of\nwhom we shall talk more the next time; his father married a Pepys).\nIn discourse, he told me further that his grandfather, my great\ngrandfather, had 800/ per annum in Queen Elizabeth’s time in the\nvery town of Cottenham — and that we did certainly come out of\nScotland with the Abbot of Crowland. More talk I had, and shall\nhave more with him, but my mind is so sad and head full of all this\nill news, that I cannot now set it down.\nA short visit here, my wife coming to me, and took leave of\n_ The[oph].; and so home, where all our hearts do now ake; for the\nnews is true, that the Dutch have broke the Chain and burned our\nships, and perticularly the Royall Charles; other perticulars I know\nnot, but most sad to be sure. And the truth is, I do fear so much that\nthe whole kingdom is undone, that I do this night resolve to study\nwith my father and wife what to do with the little that I have in\nmoney by me, for I give all the rest that I have in the King’s hands\nfor Tanger for lost. So God help us, and God knows what disorders\nwe may fall into and whether any violence on this office, or perhaps\nsome severity on our persons, as being reckoned by the silly people,\nor perhaps may by policy of State be thought fit to be condemned\nby the King and Duke of York, and so put to trouble; though God\nknows I have in my own person done my full duty, Iam sure. So\nhaving with much ado finished my business at the office, I home to\n1. Across the channel of the Medway.\n787\nconsider with my father and wife of things; and then to supper and\nto bed with a heavy heart. The manner of my advising this night\nwith my father was: Itook him and my wife up to her chamber, and\nshut the door and there told them the sad state of the times; how we\nare like to be all undone-—that Ido fear some violence will be offered\nto this office, where all I have in the world is. And resolved upon\nsending it away — sometimes into the country, sometimes my father\nto lie in town and have the gold with him at Sarah Giles’s, and with\nthat resolution went to bed —full of fear and fright; hardly slept all\nnight."

They gone, I continued in\nfrights and fear what to do with the rest. W.

So I must keep the silver by me, which sometimes I\nthink to fling into the house of office — and then again, know not\nhow I shall come by it if we be made to leave the office. Every\nminute some[one] or other calls for this order or that order; and so I\nforced to be at the office most of the day about the fireships which\nare to be suddenly fitted out; and it’s a most strange thing that we\nhear nothing from any of my Brethren at Chatham; so that we are\nwholly in the dark, various being the reports of what is done there—\n788\n13 June 1667\ninsomuch, that I sent Mr. Clapham express thither to see how\nmatters go. I did about noon resolve to send Mr. Gibson away after\nmy wife with another 1000 pieces, under colour of an express to Sir\nJer. Smith, who is, as Ihear, with some ships at Newcastle; which |\ndid really send to him, and may possibly prove of good use to the\nKing; for it is possible, in the hurry of business that they may not\nthink of it at Court, and the charge of express is not considerable to\nthe King. So though I entend Gibson no further then to Hunt-\nington, yet I direct him to send the packet forward.\nMy business the most of the afternoon is listening to everybody\nthat comes to the office, what news, which is variously related,\nsome better, some worse, but nothing certain. The King and Duke\nof York up and down all the day here and there; some time on\nTower hill, where the City Militia was; where the King did make a\nspeech to them that they should venture themselfs no further then\nhe would himself. I also sent (my mind being in pain) Saunders after\nmy wife and father, to overtake them at their night’s lodging to see\nhow matters go with them. In the evening I sent for my cousin\nSarah and her husband; who came and I did deliver them my chest\nof writings about Brampton, and my brother Tom’s papers and my\nJournalls, which I value much — and did send my two silver flagons\nto Kate Joyce’s: that so, being scattered what I have, something\nmight be saved. I have also made a girdle, by which with some\ntrouble I do carry about me 300! in gold about my body, that I may\nnot be without something in case I should be surprized; for I think,\n_ in any nation but ours, people that appear (for we are not endeed so)\nso faulty as we would have their throats cut. In the evening comes\nMr. Pelling and several others to the office, and tell me that never\nwere people so dejected as they are in the City all over at this day,\nand do talk most loudly, even treason; as, that we are bought and\nsold, that we are betrayed by the papists and others about the King —\ncry out that the Office of the Ordinance hath been so backward as\nno powder to have been at Chatham nor Upner Castle till such a\ntime, and the carriages all broken — that Legg is a papist — that\nUpner, the old good castle built by Queen Elizabeth, should be\nlately slighted — that the ships at Chatham should not be carried up\nhigher. They look upon us as lost; and remove their families and\nrich goods in the City and do think verily that the French, being\ncome down with his army to Dunkirke, it is to invade us — and that\nwe shall be invaded. Mr. Clerke the solicitor comes to me about\nbusiness, and tells me that he hears that the King hath chosen Mr.\n789\nPierpoint and Vaughan of the West privy councillors — that my\nLord Chancellor was affronted in the Hall this day by people telling\nhim of his Dunkirke house — and that there are Regiments ordered\nto be got together, whereof to be commanders my Lord Fairfax,\nIngolsby, Bethell, Norton, and Birch and other presbyterians; and\nthat Dr. Bates will have liberty to preach. Now whether this be true\nor not, I know not; but do think that nothing but this will unite us\ntogether. Late at night comes Mr. Hudson the cooper, my\nneighbour, and tells me that he came from Chatham this evening at\n5 a-clock and saw this afternoon the Royall James, Oake, and London\nburnt by the enemy with their fireships; that two or three men-of-\nwar came up with them, and made no more of Upner castle’s\nshooting then of a fly — that these ships lay below Upner Castle (but\ntherein I conceive he is in an error) — that the Dutch are fitting out\nthe Royall Charles — that we shot so far as from the yard thither, so\nthat the shot did no good, for the bullets grazed on the water — that\nUpner played hard with their guns at first, but slowly afterward,\neither from the men being beat off or their powder spent. But we\nhear that the fleet in the Hope is not come up any higher the last\nflood. And Sir W. Batten tells me that ships are provided to sink in\nthe River about Woolwich, that will prevent their coming up\nhigher if they should attempt it. I made my will also this day, and\ndid give all I had equally between my father and wife — and left\ncopiesofit in each of Mr. Hater and W. Hewer’s hands, who both\nwitnessed the will; and so to supper and then to bed; and slept pretty\nwell, but yet often waking."

But that that he tells me of worst\nconsequence is that he himself (I think he said) did hear many\nEnglishmen on board the Dutch ships, speaking to one another in\nEnglish, and that they did cry and say, “We did heretofore fight for\ntickets; now we fight for Dollers!’’ and did ask how such and such a\none did, and would commend themself to them — which is a sad\nconsideration. And several seamen came this morning to me to tell\nme that if I would get their tickets paid, they would go and do all\nthey could against the Dutch; but otherwise they would not venture\nbeing killed and lose all they have already fought for — so that I was\nforced to try what I could do to get them paid. And endeed, the\nhearts as well as affections of the seamen are turned away; and in the\n790\n14 June 1667\nOpen streets in wapping, and up and down, the wifes have cried\npublicly, ““This comes of your not paying our husbands; and now\nyour work is undone, or done by hands that understand it not;”’ and\nSir W.

The dismay that is upon us all in the\nbusiness of the kingdom and Navy at this day, is not to be expressed\notherwise then by the condition the citizens were in when the City\nwas on fire, nobody knowing which way to turn themselfs, while\neverything concurred to greaten the fire; as here, the easterly gale\nand spring-tides, for coming up both rivers and enabling them to\nbreak the chain. D. Gawden did tell me yesterday that the day\nbefore at the Council, they were ready to fall together by the ears at\nthe council-table, arraigning one another of being guilty of the\ncounsel that brought us into this misery, by laying up all the great\nships. Mr. Hater tells me at noon that some rude people have been,\nas he hears, at my Lord Chancellor’s, where they have cut down the\ntrees before his house and broke his windows; and a Gibbet either\nset up before or painted upon his gate, and these words writ —\n“Three sights to be seen; Dunkirke, Tanger, and a barren Queen.”’\nIt gives great matter of talk that it is said there is at this hour in the\n791\n1667 14 June\nExchequer as much money as is ready to break down the floor. This\narises, I believe, from Sir G. Downing’s late talk of the greatness of\nthe sum lying there of people’s money that they would not fetch\naway, which he showed me and a great many others. Most people\nthat I speak with are in doubt how we shall do to secure our seamen\nfrom running over to the Duch; which is a sad but very true\nconsideration at this day. At noon am told that my Lord Duke of\nAlbemarle is made Lord High Constable; the meaning whereof at\nthis time I know not, nor whether it be true or no. Dined, and Mr.\nHater and W. Hewer with me; where they do speak very\nsorrowfully of the posture of the times, and how people do cry out\nin the streets of their being bought and sold; and both they and\neverybody that come to me do tell me that people make nothing of\ntalking treason in the streets openly: as, that we are bought and sold\nand governed by Papists and that we are betrayed by people about\nthe King and shall be delivered up to the French, and I know not\nwhat. At dinner we discoursed of Tom-of-the-Wood, a fellow that\nlives like a Hermit near Woolwich, who as they say (and Mr.\nBodham, they tell me, affirms that he was by at the Justice’s when\nsome did accuse him there for it) [did] foretell the burning of the\nCity, now says that a greater desolation is at hand. Thence we read\nand laughed at Lillys prophecies this month — in his almanac this\nyear. So to the office after dinner; and thither comes Mr. Pierce,\nwho tells me his condition: how he cannot get his money (about\nsool, which he says is a very great part of what he hath for his family\nand children) out of Viner’s hand—and endeed, it is to be feared that\nthis will wholly undo the banquiers. He says he knows nothing of\nthe late affronts to my Lord Chancellors house as is said, nor hears\nof the Duke of Albemarle’s being made High Constable; but says\nthat they are in great distraction at Whitehall — and that everywhere\npeople do speak high against Sir W. Coventry; but he agrees with\nme that he is the best Minister of State the King hath, and so from\nmy heart I believe.\nAt night came home Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Penn, who only\ncan tell me that they have placed guns at Woolwich and Deptford\nand sunk some ships below Woolwich and Blackwall, and are in\nhopes that they will stop the enemy’s coming up. But strange our\nconfusion; that among them that are sunk they have gone and sunk\nwithout consideration the Franckin, one of the King’s ships, with\nstores to a very considerable value, that hath been long loaden for\nsupply of the ships and the new ship at Bristoll, and much wanted\n792\n14 June 1667\nthere — and nobody will own that they directed it, but do lay it on\nSir W. Rider; they speak also of another ship, loaden to the value of\n8000o0/, sunk with the goods in her, or at least was mighily\ncontended for by him, and a foreign ship that had the faith of the\nnation for her security; this Sir R. Ford tells us. And it is too plain a\ntruth, that both here and at Chatham the ships that we have sunk\nhave many, and the first of them, been ships completely fitted for\nfireships at great charge. But most strange, the backwardness and\ndisorder of all people, especially the King’s people in pay, to do any\nwork (Sir W. Penn tells me), all crying out for money. And it was\nso at Chatham, that this night comes an order from Sir W.\nCoventry to stop the pay of the wages of that Yard, the Duke of\nAlbemarle having related that not above three of 1100 in pay there\ndid attend to do any work there. This evening, having sent a\nmessenger to Chatham on purpose, we have received a dull letter\nfrom my Lord Brouncker and P. Pett how matters have gone there\nthis week; but not so much, or so perticular as we knew it by\ncommon talk before, and as true. I doubt they will be found to have\nbeen but slow men in this business; and they say the Duke of\nAlbemarle did tell my Lord Brouncker to his face that his\ndischarging of the great ships there was the cause of all this; and lam\ntold that it is become common talk against my Lord Brouncker, but\nin that he is to be\njustified, for he did it by verball order from Sir W.\nCoventry, and with good intent; and was to good purpose,\nwhatever the success* be, for the men would have but spent the\nKing so much the more in wages, and yet not attended on board to\nhave done the King any service. And this morning also, some of the\nCambriges men came up from Portsmouth by order from Sir Fre.\nHollis, who boasted to us the other day that he had sent for 50, and\nwould be hanged if roo did not come up, that would do as much as\ntwice the number of other men: I say some of them, instead of\nbeing\nat work at Deptford where they were intended, do come to the\noffice this morning to demand the payment of their tickets, for\notherwise they would, they said, do no more work; and are, as I\nunderstand from everybody that have do with them, the most\ndebauched, damning, swearing rogues that ever were in the Navy,\njust like their profane commander. So to W. Batten’s to sit and talk\na little; and then home to my flagelette, my heart being at pretty\ngood ease by aletter from my wife, brought by Saunders, that my\nfather and wife got well last night to their Inne and out again this\nmorning, and Gibson’s being got safe to Caxton at 12 last night. So\n793\nto supper, and then to bed. No news today of any motion of the\nenemy, either upwards towards Chatham or this way."

No news more then last night;\nonly, Purser Tyler comes and tells me that he being at all the\npassages in this business at Chatham, he says there have been\nhorrible miscarriages, such as we shall shortly hear of. That the\nwant of boats hath undone us; and it is commonly said, andSir J.\nMennes under his hand tells us, that they were imployed by the men\nof the Yard to carry away their goods; and J hear that Comissioner\nPett will be found the first man that begun to remove; he is much\nspoken against — and Brouncker is complained of and reproached\nfor discharging the men of the great ships heretofore. At noon Mr.\nHater dined with me, and tells me he believes that it will hardly be\nthe want of money alone that will excuse to the Parliament the\nneglect of not setting out a fleet, it having never been [harbour-]\nbound in our greatest straits; but how[ever] unlikely that it\nappeared, yet when it was gone about, the State or King did\ncompass it; and there is something in it. In like manner, all the\nafternoon busy, vexed to see how slowly things go on for want of\nmoney. At night comes (unexpectedly so soon) Mr. Gibson, who\nleft my wife well and all got down well with them, but not with\nhimself, who (which I was afeared of and cannot blame him, but\nmust myself be wiser against another time) had one of his bags\nbroke through his breeches. And some pieces dropped out, not\nmany (he thinks but two, for he light and took them up, and went\nback and could find no more); but Iam not able to tell how many,\nwhich troubles me; but the joy of having the greatest part safe there\nmakes me bear with it, so as not to afflict myself for it. This\nafternoon, poor Betty Michell, whom Ilove, sent to tell my wife\nher child was dying; which I am troubled for, poor girl.

At noon comes Sir W. Batten and W. Penn, and we to\nW. Penn’s house and there discoursed of business an hour; and by\nand by comes an order from Sir R. Browne, commanding me this\nafternoon to attend the Council board with all my books and papers\ntouching the Medway. I was ready [to fear] some mischief to\nmyself, though that that appears most reasonable is that it is to\ninform them about Comissioner Pett. I eat a little bit in haste at W.\nBatten’s without much comfort, being fearful, though I show it\nnot; and to my office and did get up some papers and find out the\nmost material letters and orders in our books. And so took coach\nand to the Council chamber lobby, where I met Mr. Eveling, who\ndoth miserably decry our follies that brings all this misery upon us.\nWhile we were discoursing over our public misfortunes, Iam called\nin to a large committee of the Council: present, the Duke of\nAlbemarle, Anglesy, Arlington, Ashly, Carteret, Duncomb,\nCoventry, Ingram, Clifford, Lauderdale, Morice, Manchester,\nCraven, Carlisle, Bridgewater; and after Sir W. Coventry’s telling\nthem what orders his Royal Highness had made for the safety of the\nMedway, I told them to great full content what we had done, and\nshowed them our letters. Then was P. Pett call[ed] in with the\nLieutenant of the Tower. He is in his old clothes, and looked most\nsillily. His charge was chiefly the not carrying up of the great ships,\nand the using of the boats in carrying away his goods; in which he\nanswered very sillily — though his faults to me seem only great\nomissions. Lord Arlington and Coventry very severe against him;\nthe former saying that if he was not guilty, the world would think\nthem all guilty. The latter urged that there must be some fault, and\nthat the Admiral must be found to have done his part. He said he\nused never a boat till they were all gone but one — and that was to\ncarry away things of great value, and those were his models of\nships; which when the Council, some of them, had said they wished\nthat the Dutch had had them instead of the King’s ships, he\nanswered he did believe the Dutch would have made more\nadvantage of the models then of the ships, and the King have had\n795\ngreater loss thereby. This they all laughed at. After having heard\nhim for an hour or more, they bid him withdraw, I all this while\nshowing him no respect, but rather against him; for which God\nforgive me, for I mean no hurt to him, but only find that these\nLords are upon their own purgation, and it is necessary I should be\nso in behalf of the office. He being gone, they caused Sir Rd.\nBrowne to read over his minutes; and then my Lord Arlington\nmoved that they might be put into my hands to put into form, I\nbeing more acquainted with such business; and they were so.\nSo I away back with my books and papers; and when I got into\nthe Court, it was pretty to see how people gazed upon me — that I\nthought myself obliged to salute people and to smile, lest they\nshould think I was a prisoner too; but afterward I found the most\ndid take me to be there to bear evidence against P. Pett. But my fear\nwas such, at my going in, of the success of the day, that at my going\nin I did think fit to give T. Hater (whom I took with me to wait the\nevent) my closet-key and directions where to find soo/ and more in\nsilver and gold, and my tallies, to remove in case of any misfortune\nto me. I got home; and I and my wife to talk; who did give me so\nbad an account of her and my father’s method in burying of our\ngold, that made me mad -—and she herself is not pleased with it, she\nbelieving that my sister knows of it. My father and she did it on\nSunday when they were gone to church, in open daylight in the\nmidst of the garden, where for aught they knew, many eyes might\nsee them; which put me into such trouble, that I was almost mad\nabout it, and presently cast about how to have it back again to\nsecure it here, the times being a little better now; at least, at\nWhitehall they seem as if they were — but one way or other, I am\nresolved to free them from the place ifI can get them. Such was my\ntrouble at this, that Ifell out with my wife; that though new come to\ntown, Idid not sup with her nor speak to her tonight, but to bed and\nsleep."

This morning\nGreeting came, and I with him at my flagelette. At noon dined at\nhome with my wife alone; and then in the afternoon, all the day at\nmy office — troubleda little at a letter from my father which tells me\nof an idle companion, one Coleman, who went down with him and\nmy wife in the coach and came up again with my wife, a pensioner\nof the King’s Guard and one that my wife, endeed, made the feast\nfor on Saturday last, though he did not come; but if he knows\nnothing of our money, I will prevent any other inconvenience. In\nthe evening comes Mr. Povy about business, and he and Ito walk in\nthe garden an hour or two and to talk of State matters; he tells me his\nopinion that it is out of possibility for us to escape being undone,\nthere being nothing in our power to do that is necessary for the\nsaving us —a lazy prince — no council — no money; no reputation at\nhome or abroad.

Nay, he hath come out of his wife’s bed and gone to\nothers laid in bed for him. That Mr. Brouncker is not the only\npimp, but that the whole family is of the same strain, and will do\nanything to please him. That, besides the death of the two princes\nlately, the family is in horrible disorder by being in debt, by\nspending above 60000/ per annum when he hath not 40000l. That\nthe Duchesse is not only the proudest woman in the world, but the\nmost expenseful; and that the Duke of York’s marriage with her\nhath undone the kingdom by making the Chancellor so great above\nreach, who otherwise would have been but an ordinary man, to\nhave been dealt with by other people, and he would have been\ncareful of managing things well, for fear of being called to account;\nwhereas now, he is secure and hath let things run to wrack, as they\nnow appear.\nHe tells me that the other day, upon this ill news of the Duch\nbeing upon us, Whitehall was shut up and the Council called and sat\nclose (and by the way he doth assure me, from the mouth of some\nprivy councillors, that at this day the Privy council in general doth\nknow no more what the state of the kingdom as to peace and war is\nthen he or I, nor knows who manages it nor upon whom it\ndepends); and there my Lord Chancellor did make a speech to\nthem, saying that they knew well that he was no friend to the war\nfrom the beginning, and therefore had concerned himself little in,\nnor could say much to it; anda great deal of that kind, to discharge\nhimself\nofthe fault of the war—upon which, my Lord Anglesy rose\nup and told his Majesty that he thought their coming now together\nwas not to enquire who was or was not the cause of the war, but to\nenquire what was or could be done in the business of making a\npeace, and in whose hands that was and where it was stopped or\nforwarded; and went on very highly to have all made open to them:\nhe tells me, speaking of the horrid effeminacy of the King, that the\nKing hath taken ten times more care and pains making friends\nbetween my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Steward when they have\nfallen out, then ever he did to save his kingdom. That the King is at\nthis day every night in Hyde park with the Duke of Monmouth or\nwith my Lady Castlemaine.

And then I to the office, where busy all the afternoon till the\nevening; and then with my wife by coach abroad to Bow and\nStratford, it being so dusty weather, that there was little pleasure in\nit; and so home and to walk in the garden, and thither comes Pelling\nto us to talk; and so in and to supper, and then to bed —all the world\nbeing, as I hear, very much damped that their hopes of peace is\nbecome uncertain again.\n9. Up pretty betimes and to the office, where busy till office time;\nand then we sat, but nothing to do but receive clamours about\nmoney. This day my Lord Anglesy, our new Treasurer, came the\nfirst time to the Board, and there sat with us till noon; and I do\nperceive he is a very notable man and understanding, and will do\nthings regular and understand them himself, not trust Fenn as Sir G.\nCarteret did, and will solicit soundly for money; which I do fear\nwas Sir G. Carteret’s fault, that he did not do that enough,\nconsidering the age we live in, that nothing will do but by\nsolicitation — though never so good for the King or Kingdom; and a\nbad business well solicited shall for peace sake speed, when a good\none shall not. But I do confess I do think it a very bold act of him to\ntake upon him the place of Treasurer of the Navy at this time; but\nwhen I consider that a regular accountant* never ought to fear\nanything, nor have reason, I then do cease to wonder. At noon\nhome to dinner and to play on the flagelette with my wife; and then\nto the office, where very busy, close at my office till late at night; at\nnight walked and sang with my wife in the garden, and so home to\nsupper and to bed. This evening news comes for certain that the\nDutch are with their fleet before Dover, and that it is expected they\nwill attempt something there. The business of the peace is quite\ndashed again, so as now it is doubtful whether the King will\ncondescend to what the Dutch demand, it being so near the\n805\nParliament, it being a thing that will, it may be, recommend him to\nthem when they shall find that the not having of a peace lies on his\nside, by denying some of their demands."

She ready, and taking some bottles of wine\nand beer and some cold Fowle with us into the Coach, we took\ncoach and four horses which I had provided last night, and so away\n— a very fine day; and so towards Epsum, talking all the way\npleasantly. The country very fine; only, the way very dusty. We\ngot to Epsum by 8 a-clock to the Well, where much company; and\nthere we light and I drank the water; they did not, but do go about\nand walk a little among the women, but I did drink four pints and\nhad some very good stools by it. Here I met with divers of our\ntown; among others, with several of the tradesmen of our office,\nbut did talk but little with them, it growing hot in the sun; and so\nwe took coach again and to the Towne to the King’s Head, where\nour coachman carried us; and there had an ill room for us to go into,\nbut the best in the house that was not taken up; here we called for\ndrink and bespoke dinner. And hear that my Lord Buckhurst and\nNelly is lodged at the next house, and Sir Ch. Sidly with them, and\nkeep a merry house. Poor girl, I pity her; but more the lossof her at\nthe King’s House. W. Hewers rode with us, andI left him and the\nwomen, and myself walked to church, where few people (contrary\nto what I expected) and none I knew but all the Houblons brothers;\nand them after sermon I did salute and walk with towards my Inne,\nwhich was in their way to their lodgings. They came last night to\nsee their elder brother, who stays here at the waters, and away\ntomorrow. James did tell me that I was the only happy man of the\nNavy; of whom, he says, during all this freedom the people have\ntaken of speaking treason, he hath not heard one bad word of me-\nwhich is a great joy to me, for I hear the same of others; but do\nknow that Ihave deserved as well as most. We parted, to meet anon;\nand I to my women into a better room, which the people of the\n807\n1667 14 July\nhouse borrowed for us; and there to dinner, a good dinner, and\nwere merry; and Pendleton came to us, who happened to be in the\nhouse, and there talked and were merry.\nAfter dinner, he gone, we all lay down after dinner (the day being\nwonderful hot) to sleep, and each of us took a good nap and then\nrose; and Tom Willson came to see me and sat and talked an hour,\nand I perceive he hath been much acquainted with Dr. Fuller (Tom)\nand Dr. Pierson and several of the great Cavalier parsons during the\nlate troubles; and I was glad to hear him talk of them, which he did\nvery ingeniously, and very much of Dr. Fullers art of memory,\nwhich he did tell me several instances of. By and by he parted, and\nwe took coach and to take the ayre, there beinga fine breeze abroad;\nand I went and carried them to the Well and there filled some bottles\nof water to carry home with me. Here W. Hewer’s horse broke\nloose, and we had the sport to see him taken again. ThenI carried\nthem to see my Cosen Pepys’s house; and light and walked round\nabout it, and they like it (as endeed it deserves) very well, and is a\npretty place; and then I walked them to the wood hard by and there\ngot them in in the thickets, till they had lost themselfs and I could\nnot find the way into any of the walks in the wood, which endeed\nare very pleasant if I could have found them. At last got out of the\nwood again; and I, by leaping down the little bank coming out of\nthe wood, did sprain my right foot, which brought me great\npresent pain; but presently, with walking, it went away for the\npresent, and so the women and W. Hewer and I walked upon the\nDownes, where a flock of sheep was, and the most pleasant and\ninnocent sight that ever Isaw in my life; we find a shepheard and his\nlittle boy reading, far from any houses or sight of people, the Bible\nto him. So I made the boy read to me, which he did with the forced\nTone that children do usually read, that was mighty pretty; and\nthen I did give him something and went to the father and talked\nwith him; andI find he had been a servant in my Cosen Pepys’s\nhouse, and told me what was become of their old servants. He did\ncontent himself mightily in my liking his boy’s reading and did\nbless God for him, the most like one of the old Patriarchs that ever I\nsaw in my life, and it brought those thoughts of the old age of the\nworld in my mind for two or three days after. We took notice of his\nwoolen knit stockings of two colours mixed, and of his shoes shod\nwith Iron shoes, both at the toe and heels, and with great nails in the\nsoles of his feet, which was mighty pretty; and taking notice of\nthem, “Why,” says the poor man, “‘the Downes, yousee, are full of\n808\nstones, and we are fain to shoe ourselfs thus; and these,” says he,\n“will make the stones fly till they sing before me.” I did give the\npoor man something, for which he was mighty thankful, and Itried\nto cast stones with his Horne Crooke. He values his dog mightily,\nthat would turn a sheep any way which he would have him when he\ngoes to fold them. Told me there was about 18 Scoare sheep in his\nflock, and that he hath 4s. a week the year round for keeping of\nthem. So we parted thence, with mighty pleasure in the discourse\nwe had with this poor man; and Mrs. Turner, in the common fields\nhere, did gather one of the prettiest nosegays that ever I saw in my\nlife.\nSo to our coach, and through Mr. Minnes’s wood and looked\nupon Mr. Eveling’s house; and so over the common and through\nEpsum towne to our Inne, in the way stopping a poor woman with\nher milk-pail and in one of my gilt Tumblers did drink our bellyfuls\nof milk, better then any Creame; and so to our Inne and there had a\ndish of creame, but it was sour and so had no pleasure in it; and so\npaid our reckoning and took coach, it being about 7 at night, and\npassed and saw the people walking with their wifes and children to\ntake the ayre; and we set out for home, the sun by and by going\ndown, and we in the cool of the evening all the way with much\npleasure home, talking and pleasing ourselfs with the pleasure of\nthis day’s work; and Mrs. Turner mightily pleased with my\nresolution, which tell her is never to keep a country-house, but to\nkeep a coach and with my wife on the Saturday to go sometimes for\na day to this place and then quite to another place; and there is more\nvariety, and as little charge and no trouble, as there is in a country-\nhouse. Anon it grew dark, and as it grew dark we had pleasure to\nsee several Glow wormes, which was mighty pretty. But my foot\nbegins more and more to pain me; which Mrs. Turner, by keeping\nher warm hand upon it, did much ease; but so that when we came\nhome, which was just at 11 at night, Iwas not able to walk from the\nlane’s end to my house without being helped, which did trouble\nme; and therefore to bed presently; but thanks be to God, found that\nI had not been missed nor any business happened in my absence; so\nto bed and there had a cere-cloth laid to my foot; and lay alone, but\nin great pain all night long."

The\nSpeaker told them, as soon as they were sat, that he was ordered by\nthe King to let them know he was hindered by some important\nbusiness to come to them and speak to them as he intended; and\ntherefore ordered him to move that they would adjourn themselfs\ntill Monday next (itbeing very plain to all the House that he expects\nto hear by that time of the sealing of the peace, which by letters, it\nseems from my Lord Hollis, was to be sealed the last Sunday); but\nbefore they would come to the Question whether they would\nadjourne, Sir Tho.

Then rose Sir W.\nCoventry and told them that he did approve of what the last\ngentleman said; but also that at the same time he did no more then\nwhat, he durst be bold to say, he knew to be the King’s mind, that as\nsoon as peace was concluded, he would do of himself. Then rose Sir\nTho. Littleton and did give several reasons, from the uncertainty of\ntheir meeting again but to adjourne (in case news comes of the peace\nbeing ended before Monday next), and the possibility of theKing’s\nhaving some about him that may endeavour to alter his own, and\nthe good part of his Council’s, advice for the keeping up of the land\narmy; and therefore it was fit that they did present it to the King as\ntheir desire, that as soon as peace was concluded, the land army\nmight be laid down, and that this their request might be carried to\nthe King by them of their House that were privy councillors; which\nwas put to the vote, and carried nemine contradicente. So after this\nvote passed, they adjourned; but it is plain what the effects of this\nParliament will be if they be suffered to sit, that they will fall foul\nupon the faults of the government; and I pray God they may be\npermitted to do it, for nothing else I fear will save the King and\nKingdom then the doing it betimes.

The house full, and in all things\nof mighty content to me. Thence to the New Exchange with my\nwife, where at my bookseller’s Isaw the History ofthe Royall Society,\nwhich I believe is a fine book and I have bespoke one in quires. So\nhome, andIto the office a little; and so to my chamber and read the\nhistory of 88 in Speede, in order to my seeing the play thereof acted\ntomorrow at the King’s House. So to supper, in some pain by the\nsudden change of the weather cold and my drinking of cold drink;\nwhich Imust I fear begin to leave off, thoughI shall try it as long as I\ncan without much pain.

But the play is\nthe most ridiculous that sure ever came upon stage, and endeed is\nmerely a show; only, shows the true garbe of the queens in those\n819\ndays, just as we see Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth painted — but\nthe play is merely a puppet-play acted by living puppets. Neither\nthe design nor language better; and one stands by and tells us the\nmeaning of things. Only, I was pleased to see Knipp dance among\nthe milkmaids, and to hear her sing a song to Queen Elizabeth — and\nto see her come out in her nightgowne, with no locks on, but her\nbare face and hair only tied up in a knot behind; which is the\ncomeliest dress that ever I saw her in to her advantage.

Walk back home and to our own church, where a dull\nsermon and our church empty of the best sort of people, they being\nat their country-houses; and so home, and there dined with me Mr.\nTurner and his daughter Betty. We had a good haunch of venison,\npowdered and boiled, and a good dinner and merry. After dinner\ncomes Mr. Pelling the pothecary, whom Ihad sent for to dine with\nme, but he was engaged. After sitting an hour to talk, we broke up,\nall leaving Pelling to talk with my wife, and I walked toward\nWhitehall; but being weary, turned into St. Dunstan’s church,\nwhere I hear an able sermon of the Minister of the place. And stood\nby a pretty, modest maid, whom I did labour to take by the hand\nand body; but she would not, but got further and further from me,\nand at last I could perceive her to take pins out of her pocket to prick\nme if I should touch her again; which seeing, I did forbear, and was\nglad I did espy her design. And then I fell to gaze upon another\npretty maid in a pew close to me, and she on me; and I did go about\nto take her by the hand, which she suffered a little and then\nwithdrew. So the sermon ended and the church broke up, and my\namours ended also; and so took coach and home, and there took up\nmy wife and to Islington with her, our old road; but before we got\nto Islington, between that and Kingsland, there happened an odd\nadventure; one of our coach-horses fell sick of the staggers, so as he\nwas ready to fall down. The coachman was fain to light and hold\n820\nhim up and cut his tongue to make him bleed, and his tail—the horse\ncontinued shakeing every part of him, as ifhe had been in an ague a\ngood while, and his blood settled in his tongue, and the coachman\nthought and believed he would presently drop down dead. Then he\nblew some tobacco in his nose; upon which the horse sneezed, and\nby and by grows well and draws us the rest of the way as well as\never he did; which was one of the strangest things of a horse I ever\nobserved — but he says it is usual. It is the staggers. Stayed and eat\nand drank at Islington at the old house, and so home and to my\nchamber to read; and then to supper and to bed."

After dinner by coach to\nWhitehall. Having done my business, I to Creeds chamber and\nthence out to Whitehall with him, in our way meeting with Mr.\nCooling, my Lord Chamberlaines secretary, on horseback, who\nstopped to speak to us; and he proved very drunk and did talk and\nwould have talked all night with us, I not being able to break loose\nfrom him, he holding me so by the hand. But Lord, to see his\npresent humour; how he swears at every word and talks of the King\nand my Lady Castleman in the plainest words in the world. And\nfrom him I gather that the story I learned yesterday is true — that the\nKing hath declared that he did not get the child of which she is\nconceived at this time, he having not as he says lain with her this half\nyear; but she told him — “God damn me, but you shall own it!”’ It\nseems he isjealous ofJermin and she loves him, so that the thoughts\nof his marrying of my Lady Falmouth puts her into fits of the\nmother. And he, it seems, hath lain with her from time to time\ncontinually, for a good while; and once, as this Cooling says, the\n815\n1667 30 July—9g August\nKing had like to have taken him a-bed with her, but that he was fain\nto creep under the bed into her closet. And so he talked very lewdly.\nAnd then took notice of my kindness to him on shipboard seven\nyears ago, when the King was coming over, and how much he was\nobliged to me; but says, “Pray look upon this acknowledgement of\na kindness in me to bea miracle; for,” says [he], “‘it is against the law\nat Court for a man that borrows money of me, even to buy his place\nwith, to own it the next Sunday.” And then told us his horse was a\nBribe, and his boots a bribe; and told us he was made upofbribes, as\na Oxford scholar is set out with other men’s goods when he goes\nout of town, and that he makes every sort of tradesmen to bribe\nhim; and invited me home to his house to taste of his bribe-wine. I\nnever heard so much vanity from a man in my life. So being now\nweary of him, we parted, and I took coach and carried Creed to the\nTemple, there set him down, and to my office, where busy late till\nmy eyes begun to ake; and then home to supper: a pullet, with good\nsauce, to my liking; and then to play on the flagelette with my wife,\nwhich she now does very prettily, and so to bed.\n-* AUGUST#-\n4.

Busy at my office from morning till night in writing\nwith my own hand fair our large general account of the expense and\ndebt of the Navy — which lasted me till night to do, that Iwas almost\nblind; and Mr. Gibson with me all day long, and dined with me; and\nexcellent discourse I had with him, he understanding all the\nbusiness of the Navy most admirably. To walk alittle with my wife\nat night in the garden, it being very hot weather again, and so to\nsupper and to bed.\ng. Up, and betimes with Sir H.

At the office all the morning, and at noon home to dinner,\nwhere I sang and piped with my wife with great pleasure, and did\nhire a coach to carry us to Barnet tomorrow. After dinner, I to the\noffice and there wrote as long as my eyes would give me leave, and\nthen abroad and to the New Exchange to the bookseller’s there,\nwhere I hear of several new books coming out — Mr. Pratts history\nof the Royal Society and Mrs. Phillips’s poems.

Lords day. Up by 4a-clock and ready with Mrs. Turner to take\ncoach before 5; which we did, and set on our Journy and got to the\nWells at Barnett by 7 a-clock, and there found many people a-\ndrinking; but the morning is a very cold morning, so as we were\nvery cold all the way in the coach. Here we met Joseph Batelier and I\ntalked with him, and here was W. Hewers also and his uncle\nSteventon. So after drink[ing] three glasses, and the women\nnothing, we back by coach to Barnett, where to the Red Lyon;\nwhere we light and went up into the Great Room and there drank\nand eat some of the best cheese-cakes that ever Ieat in my life; and so\ntook coach again, and W. Hewers on horseback with us, and so to\nHatfield to the inn next my Lord Salsbury’s house, and there we\nrested ourselfs and drank and bespoke dinner; and so to church, it\nbeing just church-time, and there we find my Lord and my Lady\nSands and several fine ladies of the family and a great many\nhandsome faces and gentile persons more in the church, and did\nhear a most excellent good sermon, which pleased me mightily; and\nvery devout, it being upon the signs of saving grace where it is in a\nman; and one sign, which held him all this day, was that where that\ngrace was, there is also the grace of prayer; which he did handle very\nfinely. In this church lies the former Lord Salsbury, Cecill, buried in\n817\na noble tomb. So the church being done, we to our inn and there\ndined very well and mighty merry; and as soon as had dined, we\nwalked out into the park, through the fine walk of trees and to the\nvineyard, and there showed them that; which is in good order, and\nendeed a place of great delight; which together with our fine walk\nthrough the park, was of as much pleasure as could be desired in the\nworld for country pleasure, and good ayre. Being come back, and\nweary with the walk, for as I made it it was pretty long, being come\nback to our Inne, there the women had pleasure in putting on some\nstraw hats, which are much worn in this country; and did become\nthem mightily, but especially my wife. So after resting a while, we\ntook coach again and back to Barnett, where W. Hewers took us\ninto his lodging, which is very handsome, and there did treat us\nvery highly with cheesecakes, cream, tarts, and other good things;\nand then walked into the garden, which was pretty, and there filled\nmy pockets full of Filberts, and so with much pleasure (among\nother things, I met in this house with a printed book of the life of O.\nCromwell, to his honour as a soldier and politician, though as a\nrebeil, the first of that kind that ever I saw, and it is well done) took\ncoach again; and got home with great content, just at day shutting\nin; and so as soon as home, eata little, and then to bed with\nexceeding great content at our day’s work."

But I was not at church, being commanded with\nthe rest to attend the Duke of York; and therefore with Sir J.\nMennes to St. James’s, where we had much business before the\nDuke of York; and observed all things to be very kind between the\nDuke of York and W. Coventry, which did mightily joy me. When\nwe had done, Sir W. Coventry called me down with him to his\nchamber and there told me that he is leaving the Duke of York’s\nservice, which I was amazed at; but he tells me that it is not with the\n824\n2 September 1667\nleast unkindness on the Duke of York’s side, though he expects\n(and I told him he was in the right) it will be interpreted otherwise,\nbecause done just at this time. ““But,”’ says he, “‘I did desire it a good\nwhile since, and the Duke of York did with much entreaty grant it,\ndesiring that I would say nothing of it, and that he might have time\nand liberty to choose his successor without being importuned for\nothers whom he should not like” — and that he hath chosen Mr.\nWren; which I am glad of, he being a very ingenious man, and so\nW. Coventry says of him, though he knows him little; but\nperticularly commends him for the book he writ in answer to\nHarrington’s Oceana, which for that reason Iintend to buy. He tells\nme the true reason is that he being a man not willing to undertake\nmore business then he can go through, and being desirous to have\nhis whole time to spend upon the business of the Treasury and a\nlittle for his own ease, he did desire this of the Duke of York. He\nassures me that the kindness with which he goes away from the\nDuke of York is one of the greatest joys that ever he had in the\nworld. I used some freedom with him, telling him how the world\nhath discourse of his having offended the Duke of York about the\nlate business of the Chancellor; he doth not deny it, but says that\nperhaps the Duke of York might have some reason for it, he\nopposing him ina thing wherein he was so earnest; but tells me that\nnotwithstanding all that, the Duke of York doth not now, nor can\nblame him — but that the Duke of York knows that he did first speak\nof it to the Duke of York, before he spoke to any mortal creature\nbesides, which was fair dealing. I did then desire to know what was\nthe great matter that grounded his desire of the Chancellor’s\nremoval; he told me many things not fit to be spoken, and yet not\nanything of his being unfaithful to the King; but, instar omnium, he\ntold me that while he was so great at the Council board and in the\nadministration of matters, there was no room for anybody to\npropose any remedy to what was amiss or to compass anything,\nthough never so good for the Kingdom, unless approved of by the\nChancellor, he managing all things with that greatness which now\nwill be removed, that the King may have the benefit of others’\nadvice.\nTo Whitehall, where I met with many people; and among other\nthings Mr. May showed me the King’s new buildings, in order to\ntheir having of some old sails for the closing of the windows this\nwinter. I dined with Sir G. Carteret, with whom dined Mr. Jack\nAshburnham and Dr. Creeton (who I observe to be a most good\n825\n1667 2 September\nman and humble). In discourse at dinner concerning the change of\nmen’s humours and fashions touching meats, Mr. Ashburnham\ntold us that he remembers since the only fruit in request, and eaten\nby the King and Queen at table as the best fruit, was the Katharine\npayre, though they knew at that time other fruits of France and our\nown country. After dinner comes in Mr. Townsend; and there I\nwas witness of a horrid rateing, which Mr. Ashburnham, as one of\nthe Grooms of the King’s Bedchamber, did give him for want of\nlinen for the King’s person; which he swore was not to be endured,\nand that the King would not endure it, and that the King his father\nwould have hanged his wardrobe-man should he have been served\nso; the King having at this day no handkerchers and but three bands\nto his neck, he swore. Mr. Townsend answered want of money and\nthe owing of the linendraper sooo; and that he hath of late got many\nrich things made, beds and sheets and saddles, and all without\nmoney, and he can go no further; but still this old man (endeed, like\nan old loving servant) did cry out for the King’s person to be\nneglected. But when he was gone, Townsend told me that it is the\ngrooms taking away the King’s linen at the Quarter’s end, as their\nFees, which makes this great want: for whether the King can get it\nor no, they will run away at the Quarter’s end with what he hath\nhad, let the King get more as he can. From him I went to see a great\nmatch at tennis between Prince Rupert and one Capt. Cooke\nagainst Bab. May and the elder Chichly, where the King was and\nCourt, and it seems are the best players at tennis in the nation. But\nthis puts me in mind of what I observed in the morning; that the\nKing, playing at tennis, had a Steeleyard carried to him, and I was\ntold it was to weigh him after he had done playing; and at noon Mr.\nAshburnham told me that it is only the King’s curiosity, which he\nusually hath, of weighing himself before and after his play, to see\nhow much he loses in weight by playing; and this day he lost 43 1b.\nThence home and took my wife out to Mile end green and there\ndrank; and so home, having a very fine evening. Then home, and I\nto Sir W. Batten and W. Penn and there discoursed of Sir W.\nCoventry’s leaving the Duke of York and Mr. Wren’s succeeding\nhim; they told me both seriously, that they had long cut me out for\nSecretary to the Duke of York ifever W. Coventry left him; which,\nagreeing with what I have heard from other hands heretofore, doth\nmake me not only think that something of that kind hath been\nthought on, but doth comfort me to see that the world hath such an\nesteem of my qualities as to think me fit for any such thing — though\n826\nI am glad with all my heart that I am not so, for it would never\nplease me to be forced to the attendance that that would require, and\nleave my wife and family to themselfs, as I must do in such a case;\nthinking myself now in the best place that ever man was in to please\nhis own mind in, and therefore I will take care to preserve it. So to\nbed, my cold remaining, though not so much, upon me."

Coventry gone from him, will\ndisable him from being able to do anything almost, he being\nhimself almost lost in the esteem of people; and will be more and\nmore, unless my Lord Chancellor (who is already begun to be\npitied by some people, and to be better thought of then was\nexpected) doth recover himself in Parliament. He would seem to\nfear that this difference about the Crowne (ifthere be nothing else)\nwill undo us.\n13. To the office and there despatched business till 10 a-clock, and\nthen with Sir W. Batten and my wife and Mrs. Turner to\nWalthamstow by hackney coach to Mrs. Shipman’s to dinner,\nwhere Sir W. Penn and my Lady and Mrs. Lowther (the latter of\nwhich hath got a sore nose, given her I believe from her husband,\nwhich made me I could not look upon her with any pleasure); and\nhere a very good and plentiful wholesome dinner and above all\nthing, such plenty of milke-meats (she keepinga great dairy) and so\ngood as Inever met with. Afternoon proved very foul weather, the\nmorning fair. We stayed talking till evening, and then home and\nthere to my flagelette with my wife; and so to bed without any\nsupper, my belly being full and dinner not digested. It vexed me to\nhear how Sir W. Penn, who came alone from London, being to\nsend his coachman for his wife and daughter and bidding his\ncoachman in much anger to go for them (he being vexed, like a\nrogue, to do anything to please his wife), his coachman Tom was\nheard to say, “A pox of God rot her! Can she [not] walk hither?”\nThese words do so mad me, that I could find in my heart to give\nhim or my Lady notice of them.\n15. Lords day. Up to my chamber, there to set some papers to\nrights. By and by to church, where I stood in continual fear of Mrs.\nMarkham’s coming to church and offering to come into our pew; to\nprevent which, as soon as ever Iheard the great door open, Idid step\nback and clapped my breech to our pew door, that she might be\nforced to shove me to come in; but as God would have it, she did\nnot come. Mr. Mills preached; and after sermon, by invitation he\n828\nand his wife came to dine with me (which is the first time they have\nbeen in my house I think these five years), I thinking it not amiss,\nbecause of their acquaintance in our country, to show them some\nrespect. Mr. Turner and his wife and their son the Captain dined\nwith me, and IJhad a very good dinner for them — and very merry;\nand after dinner he was forced to go, though it rained, to Stepny to\npreach. We also to church, and then home, and there comes Mr.\nPelling with two men by promise, one Wallington and Piggott; the\nformer whereof, being a very little fellow, did sing a most excellent\nbass, and yet a poor fellow, a working goldsmith, that goes without\ngloves to his hands. Here we sung several good things, but I am\nmore and more confirmed that singing with many voices is not\nsinging, but a sort of Instrumentall music, the sense of the words\nbeing lost by not being heard, and especially as they set them with\nFuges of words, one after another; whereas singing properly, |\nthink, should be but with one or two voices at most, and that\ncounterpoint. They supped with me; and so broke up, and then my\nwife and I to my chamber, where through the badness of my eyes\nshe was forced to read to me, which she doth very well; and was\nMr. Boyle’s discourse upon the Style of the Scripture, which is a\nvery fine piece. And so to bed."

Oliver and John, Sandwich’s twelve-year old sons.\n838\nby; only, my father says that he saw them all gone to church before\nhe begun the work when he laid the money, but that doth not\nexcuse it to me; but I was out of my wits almost, and the more from\nthat upon my lifting up the earth with the spud, I did discern that I\nscattered the pieces of gold round about the ground among the\ngrass and loose earth; and taking up the Iron head-pieces wherein\nthey were put, Iperceive the earth was got among the gold and wet,\nso that the bags wereall rotten, all the notes, that I could not tell\nwhat in the world to say to it, not knowing how to judge what was\nwanting or what had been lost by Gibson in his coming down;\nwhich, all put together, did make me mad; and at last was forced to\ntake up the head-pieces, dirt and all, and as many of the scattered\npieces as I could with the dirt discern by the candlelight, and carry\nthem up into my brother’s chamber and there lock them up till [had\neat a little supper; and then all people going to bed, W. Hewer and I\ndid all alone, with several pales of water and basins, at last wash the\ndirt off of the pieces and parted the pieces and the dirt, and then\nbegun to tell; and by a note which I had of the value of the whole (in\nmy pocket) do find that there was short above 100 pieces, which did\nmake me mad; and considering that the neighbour’s house was so\nnear, that we could not suppose we could speak one to another in\nthe garden at the place where the gold lay (especially by my father\nbeing deaf) but they must know what we had been doing on, I\nfeared that they might in the night come and gather some pieces and\nprevent us the next morning; so W. Hewer and I out again about\nmidnight (for it was now grown so late) and there by candlelight\ndid make shift to gather 45 pieces more — and so in and to cleanse\nthem, and by this time it was past 2 in the morning; and so to bed,\nwith my mind pretty quiet to think that Ihave recovered so many.\nAnd then to bed, andIlay in the trundle-bed, the girl being gone\nto bed to my wife. And there lay in some disquiet all night, telling\nof the clock till it was daylight; and then rose and called W. Hewer,\nand he and I, with pails and a Sive, did lock ourselfs into the garden\nand there gather all the earth about the place into pails, and then Sive\nthose pails in one of the summer-houses (just as they do for\nDyamonds in other parts of the world); and there to our great\ncontent did with much trouble by 9 a-clock, and by that time we\nemptied several pails and could not find one, we did make the last\nnight’s 45 up 79; so that we are come to about 20 or 30 of what I\nthink the true number should be, and perhaps within less; and of\nthem I may reasonably think that Mr. Gibson might lose some, so\n839\nthat I am pretty well satisfied that my loss is not great and do bless\nGod that it is so well; and do leave my father to make a second\nexamination of the dirt — which he promises he will do; and poor\nman, is mightily troubled for this accident. But I declared myself\nvery well satisfied, and so endeed I am and my mind at rest in it, it\nbeing but an accident which is unusual; and so gives me some kind\nof content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep money,\nas well as to get it, and how doubtful I was how to keep it all night\nand how to secure it to London. And so got all my gold put up in\nbags; and so having the last night wrote to my Lady Sandwich to\nlend me John Bowles to go along with me my Journy, not telling\nher the reason, but it was only to secure my gold, we to breakfast;\nand then about ro a-clock took coach, my wife and I, and Willett\nand W. Hewer, and Murford and Bowles (whom my Lady lent\nme), and my brother John on horseback; and with these four I\nthought myself pretty safe. But before we went out, the Hunt-\nington music came to me and played, and it was better then that of\nCambridge. Here I took leave of my father, and did give my sister\n20s. She cried at my going; but whether it was at her unwillingness\nfor my going or any unkindness of my wife’s or no, Iknow not; but\nGod forgive me, I take her to be so cunning and ill-natured that I\nhave no great love for her; but only, is my sister and must be\nprovided for. My gold, I put into a basket and set under one of the\nseats; and so my work every quarter of an hour was to look to see\nwhether all was well, and did ride in great fear all the day; but it was\na pleasant day and good company, and I mightily contented. Mr.\nSheply saw me beyond St. Neotts and there parted, and we straight\nto Stevenage, through Baldock lanes, which are already very bad.\nAnd at Stevenage we came well before night, and all safe; and there\nwith great care I got the gold up to the chamber, my wife carrying\none bag and the girl another and W. Hewer the rest in the basket,\nand set it all under a bed in our chamber; and then sat down to talk\nand were very pleasant, satisfying myself, among other things from\nJo. Bowles, in some terms of Hunting and about deere, bucks, and\ndoes; and so anon to supper, and very merry we were and a good\nsupper; and after supper to bed.

None of my Brethren\nsaid anything but myself; only two or three silly words my Lord\nBrouncker gave, in answer to one Question about the number of\nmen there in the King’s yard at that time.

Nay,\nseveral grandees, having been to marry a daughter, have wrote\nletters to my Lord to give him notice and out of the greatness of his\nwisdom to desire his advice, though people he never saw; and then\nmy Lord, he answers by commending the greatness of his\ndiscretion in making so good an alliance &c., so ends. He says that it\nis so far from dishonour to a man to give private revenge for an\naffront, that the contrary is a disgrace; they holding that he that\nreceives an affront is not fit to appear in the sight of the world till he\nhath revenged himself; and therefore, that a gentleman there that\nreceives an affront oftentimes never appears again in the world till\nhe hath by some private way or other revenged himself; and that on\nthis account, several have fallowed their enemy privately to the\nIndys, thence to Italy, thence to France and back again, watching\nfor an opportunity to be revenged. He says my Lord was fain to\nkeep a letter from the Duke of York to the Queen of Spaina great\nwhile in his hands before he could think fit to deliver it, till he had\nlearnt whether the Queen would receive it, it being directed to his\n““Cosen.” He says that many ladies in Spain, after they are found to\nbe with child, do never stir out of their beds or chambers till they are\nbrought to bed —so ceremonious they are in that point also. He tells\nof their wooing by serenades at the window, and that their friends\ndo alway make the match; but yet that they have opportunities to\nmeet at Masse at church, and there they make love. That the Court\nthere hath no dancings, nor visits at night to see the King or\nQueene, but is always just like a Cloyster, nobody stirring in it.\nThat my Lord Sandwich wears a beard now, turned up in the\nSpanish manner.

At last Iremoved my gown and slippers safely to the other side\nof the bed over my wife, and there safely rose and put on my gown\nand breeches, and then witha firebrand in my hand safely opened\nthe door, and saw nor heard anything.

Called Jane\nup, and went down safely and opened my chamber, where all well.\nThen more.freely about, and to the kitchen, where the cook-maid\nup and all safe. So up again, and when Jane came and we demanded\nwhether she heard no noise, she said, “‘Yes, and was afeared,”’ but\nrose with the other maid and found nothing, but heard a noise in the\n850\ngreat stack of chimneys that goes from Sir\nJ.Mennes’s through our\nhouse; and so we sent, and their chimneys have been swept this\nmorning, and the noise was that and nothing else. It is one of the\nmost extraordinary accidents in my life, and gives ground to think\nof Don Quixot’s adventures how people may be surprized— and the\nmore from an accident last night, that our young gibb-cat did leap\ndown our stairs from top to bottom at two leaps and frighted us,\nthat we could not tell well whether it was the cat or a spirit, and do\nsometimes think this morning that the house might be haunted.\nGlad to have this so well over, and endeed really glad in my mind,\nfor I was much afeared. I dressed myself, and to the office both\nforenoon and afternoon, mighty hard putting papers and things in\norder to my extraordinary satisfaction, and consulting my clerks in\nmany things, who are infinite helps to my memory and reasons of\nthings. And so, being weary and my eyes akeing, having over-\nwrought them today reading so much shorthand, I home and there\nto supper, it being late, and to bed."

My work this\nnight with my clerks till midnight at the office was to examine my\nlist of ships I am making for myself, and their dimensions, and to\nsee how it agrees or differs from other lists; and I do find so great a\ndifference between them all, that I am at a loss which to take; and\ntherefore think mine to be as much depended upon as any I can\n865\nmake out of them all. So little care there hath been to this day to\nknow or keep any history of the Navy."

Up, and all the morning in my chamber making up some\naccounts against this beginning of the new year; and so about noon\nabroad with my wife, who was to dine with W. Hewer and Willet at\nMrs. Pierce’s; but I had no mind to be with them, for I do clearly\nfind that my wife is troubled at my friendship with her and Knepp,\nand so dined with my Lord Crew, with whom was Mr. Browne,\nClerk of the House of Lords, and Mr. John Crew. Here was mighty\ngood discourse, as there is alway; and among other things, my Lord\nCrew did turn to a place in the Life ofSir Ph. Sidny, wrote by Sir\nFulke Grevill, which doth foretell the present condition of this\nnation in relation to the Dutch, to the very degree of a prophecy;\nand is so remarkable that I am resolved to buy one of them, it being\nquite through a good discourse. Thence I after dinner to the Duke\nof York’s playhouse, and there saw Sir Martin Marrall, which I have\nseen so often; and yet am mightily pleased with it and think it\nmighty witty, and the fullest of proper matter for mirth that ever\nwas writ. AndI do clearly see that they do improve in their acting of\nit. Here a mighty company of citizens, prentices and others; and it\nmakes me observe that when Ibegin first to be able to bestow a play\non myself, I do not remember that I saw so many by half of the\nordinary prentices and mean people in the pit, at 2s.-6d. apiece, as\nnow; I going for several years no higher then the 12d., and then the\n18d. places, and thoughI\nstrained hard to go in then when I did—so\nmuch the vanity and prodigality of the age is to be observed in this\nperticular. Thence I to Whitehall, and there walked up and down\nthe House a while.\nBy and byI met with Mr. Brisban; and having it in my mind this\nChristmas to (do what Inever can remember that Idid) go to see the\nmanner of the gaming at the Groome porter’s (I having in my\ncoming from the playhouse stepped into the two Temple halls, and\nthere saw the dirty prentices and idle people playing — wherein Iwas\nmistaken in thinking to have seen gentlemen of quality playing\n859\n1668 1 January\nthere, as I think it was when I was alittle child, that one of my\nfather’s servants, John Bassum I think, carried me in his armes\nthither), I did tell him of it and he did lead me thither; where after\nstaying an hour, they begin to play at about 8 at night — where to see\nhow differently one man took his losing from another, one cursing\nand swearing, and another only muttering and grumbling to\nhimself, a third without any appearing discontent at all—to see how\nthe dice will run good luck in one hand for half an hour together —\nand another have no good luck at all. To see how easily here, where\nthey play nothing but guinnys, 100l is won or lost. To see two or\nthree gentlemen come in there drunk, and putting their stock of\ngold together — one 22 pieces, the second 4, and the third ¢§pieces;\nand these to play one with another, and forget how much each of\nthem brought, but he that brought the 22 think that he brought no\nmore then the rest. To see the different humours of gamesters to\nchange their luck when it is bad — how ceremonious they are as to\ncall for new dice — to shift their places — to alter their manner of\nthrowing; and that with great industry, as if there was anything in\nit. To see how some gamesters, that have no money now to spend\nas formerly, do come and sit and look on; as among others, Sir\nLewes Dives, who was here and hath been a great gamester in his\ntime. To hear their cursing and damning to no purpose; as one man,\nbeing to throwa seven if he could and failing to do it after a great\nmany throws, cried he would be damned if ever he flung seven\nmore while he lived, his despair of throwing it being so great, while\nothers did it as their luck served, almost every throw. To see how\npersons of the best quality do here sit down and play with people of\nany, though meaner; and to see how people in ordinary clothes shall\ncome hither and play away 100, or 2 or 300 guinnys, without any\nkind of difficulty. And lastly, to see the formality of the Groome\nporter, who is their judge of all disputes in play and all quarrels that\nmay arise therein; and how his under-officers are there to observe\ntrue play at each table and to give new dice, is a consideration I\nnever could have thought had been in the world, had Inot now seen\nit. And mighty glad I am that I did see it; and it may be will find\nanother evening, before Christmas be over, to see it again; when I\nmay stay later, for their heat of play begins not till about 11 or 12 a-\nclock; which did give me another pretty observation, of a man that\ndid win mighty fast when I was there: I think he won rool at single\npieces ina\nlittle time; while all the rest envied him his good fortune,\nhe cursed it, saying, “A pox on it that it should come so earely upon\n860\nme! For this fortune two hours hence would be worth something to\nme; but then, God damn me, I shall have no such luck.”’ This kind\nof profane, mad entertainment they give themselfs. And so Ihaving\nenough for once, refusing to venture, though Brisband pressed me\nhard and tempted me with saying that no man was ever known to\nlose the first time, the Devil being too cunning to discourage a\ngamester; and he offered me also to lend me ten pieces to venture,\nbut I did refuse and so went away — and took coach and home about\n9 or 10 at night."

The orders they sent for this day was the first order that I\nhave yet met with about this business, and was of my own single\nhand warranting; but I do think it will do me no harm, and\ntherefore do not much trouble myself with it — more then to see\nhow much trouble I am brought to who have best deported myself\nin all the King’s business.

At noon thence toward the committee; but\nmeeting with Sir W.

But\nthence I,to Westminster hall and there spent till late at night,\nwalking to and again with many people; and there in general I hear\nof the great high words that was in the House on Saturdy last, upon\nthe first part of the Committee’s Report about the dividing of the\nfleet;' wherein some would have the counsels of the King to be\ndeclared, and the reasons of them and who did give them; where Sir\nW. Coventry lay open to them the consequences of doing that, that\nthe King would never have any honest and wise men ever to be of\nhis Council. They did here in the House talk boldly of the King’s\nbad counsellors, and how they must be all turned out, and many of\nthem, and better, brought in; and the proceedings of the Long\nParliament in the beginning of the war were called to memory. And\nthe King’s bad intelligence was mentioned, wherein they were\nbitter against my Lord Arlington; saying, among other things, that\nwhatever Morrices was, who declared he had but 750! a year\nallowed him for intelligence, the King paid too dear for my Lord\nArlington’s in giving him 10000! and a Barony for it. Some\nmutterings Idid hear of a design of dissolveing the Parliament, but I\nthink there is no ground for it yet, though Oliver would have\ndissolved them for half the trouble and contempt these have put\nupon the King and his councils. The dividing of the fleet, however,\nis I hear voted a miscarriage, and the not building a fortification at\nSherenesse; and I have reason every hour to expect that they will\nvote the like of our paying men off by ticket; and what the\nconsequence of that will be I know not, but am put thereby into\ngreat trouble of mind.

In discourse, we think\nourselfs safe for this year by this league with Holland, which pleases\neverybody, and they say vexes France; insomuch that De lestrade\nthe French Imbassador in Holland, when he heard it, told the States\nthat he would have them not forget that his Maister is in the head of\n100000 men, and is but 28 years old— which was a great speech. The\nBishop tells me he thinks that the great business of Toleration will\nnot, notwithstanding this talk, be carried this Parliament; nor for\nthe King’s taking away the Deanes and Chapters’ lands to supply\nhis wants, they signifying little to him — if he had them for his\npresent service.

Upand by coach, with W. Griffin with me and our contract-\nbooks, to Durham Yard to the Commissioners for Accounts — the\nfirst time I ever was there; and staying a while before Iwas admitted\nto them, I did observe a great many people attending about\ncomplaints of seamen concerning tickets; and among others, Mr.\nCarcasse and Mr. Martin my purser. And I observe a fellow, one\nCollins, is there, who is imployed by these Commissioners\nperticularly to hold an office in Bishopsgate street, or somewhere\nthereabouts, to receive complaints of all people about tickets — and I\nbelieve he will have work enough. Presently Iwas called in, where I\nfound the whole number of Commissioners, and was there\nreceived with great respect and kindness and did give them great\nsatisfaction, making it my endeavour to inform them what it was\nthey were to expect from me and what was the duty of other\npeople, this being my only way to preserve myself after all my pains\nand trouble. They did ask many questions and demand other books\nof me; which I did give them very ready and acceptable answers to;\nand upon the whole, I observe they do go about their business like\nmen resolved to go through with it, and ina very good method, like\nmen of understanding. They have Mr. Jessop their secretary; and it\nis pretty to see that they are fain to find out an old-fashion man of\nCromwell’s to do their business for them, as well as the Parliament\nto pitch upon such for the most part in the list of people that were\nbrought into the House for Commissioners. | went away with\ngiving and receiving great satisfaction; and so away to Whitehall to\nthe Commissioners of Treasury — where waiting some time, I met\nthere with Coll. Birch and he andI fell into discourse, and Idid give\nhim thanks for his kindness to me in the Parliament-house, both\nbefore my face and behind my back; he told me he knew me to bea\nman of the old way for taking pains, and did always endeavour to\ndo me right and prevent anything that was moved that might tend\nto my injury — which I was obliged to him for, and thanked him.\nThence to talk of other things and the want of money and he told\nme of the general want of money in the country; that land sold for\nnothing, and the many pennyworths he knew of lands and houses\nupon them with good titles in his country, at 16 years’ purchase.\n“And,” says he, “though I am in debt, yet I have a mind to one, and\nthat is a Bishop’s lease;” “But,” said I, “will you choose sucha\nlease\nbefore any other?” - “Yes,” says he plainly, “because I know they\ncannot stand, and then it will fall into the King’s hands, and I in\npossession shall have an advantage by it — and,”’ says he, “I know\n869\n1668 31 _January—2 February\nthey must fall, and they are now near it, taking all the ways they can\nto undo themselfs and showing us the way;”’ and thereupon told me\na story of the present quarrel between the Bishop and Deane of\nCoventry and Lichfield; the former of which did excommunicate\nthe latter and caused his excommunication to be read in the church\nwhile he was there; and after it was read, the Deane made the service\nbe gone through with, though himself, an excommunicate, was\npresent (which is contrary to the Canon), and said he would justify\nthe Quire therein against the Bishop; and so they are at law in the\nArches about it — which is a very pretty story. He tells me that the\nKing is for Toleration, though the Bishops be against it; and that he\ndoth not doubt but it will be carried in Parliament but that he fears\nsome will stand for the tolerating of papists with the rest; and that\nhe knows not what to say to, but rather thinks that the sober party\nwill be without it rather then have it upon those terms — and I do\nbelieve so. Here we broke off, and I home to dinner; and after\ndinner set down my wife and Deb at the Change, and I to make a\nvisit to Mr. Godolphin at his lodgings; who is come late from Spain\nfrom my Lord Sandwich, and did the other day, meeting me in\nWhitehall, compliment me mightily; and so I did offer him this\nvisit, but missed him.

And that being\ndone, I out of doors to Westminster hall and there met my Lord\nBrouncker, who tells me that our business is put off till Monday,\nand so Iwas mighty glad that I was eased of my attendance here and\nof any occasion that might put me out of humour, as it is likely ifwe\nhad been called before the Parliament. Therefore, after having\nspoke with Mr. Godolphin and Cosen Roger, I away home and\nthere do find everything in mighty good order; only, my wife not\ndressed, which troubles me. Anon comes my company, viz., my\nLord Hinchingbrooke and his Lady, Sir Ph. Carteret and his Lady,\nGodolphin and my Cosen Roger, and Creed, and mighty merry;\nand by and by to dinner, which was very good and plentiful (I\nshould have said, and Mr. George Mountagu, who came at a very\nlittle warning, which was exceeding kind of him): and there among\nother things, my Lord had Sir Samuel Morland’s late invention for\ncasting up sums of olos.od.; which is very pretty, but not very\nuseful. Most of our discourse was of my Lord Sandwich and his\nfamily, as being all of us of that family; and with extraordinary\npleasure all the afternoon thus together, eating and looking over my\ncloset: and my Lady Hinchingbrooke I find a very sweet-natured\nand well-disposed lady, a lover of books and pictures and of good\nunderstanding. About 5 a-clock they went, and then my wife andI\nabroad by coach into Moorefields, only fora little ayre; and so\nhome again, staying nowhere, and then up to her chamber, there to\ntalk with pleasure of this day’s passages, and so to bed.\n15. Lords day. To Whitehall and there walked with this man and that\nman till chapel done and the King dined; and then Sir Tho. Clifford\nthe Controller took me with him to dinner to his lodgings, where\nmy Lord Arlington anda great deal of good and great company —\nwhere Ivery civilly used by them —and had a most excellent dinner.\nAnd good discourse of Spain, Mr. Godolphin being there —\nperticularly of the removal of the bodies of all the dead Kings of\nSpain that could be got together, and brought to the Pantheon at the\nEscuriall (when it was finished) and there placed before the Alter,\nthere to lie for ever. And there was a sermon made to them upon\nthis text, Arida ossa, audite verbum dei — a most eloquent sermon as\nthey say who say they have read it. After dinner, away thence; andI\nto Mrs. Martin’s and there spent the afternoon and did hazer con\n889\nella; and here was her sister and Mrs. Burrows; and so in the\nevening got a coach and home, and there find Mr. Pelling and W.\nHewer, and there talked and supped (Pelling being gone); and\nmightily pleased with a picture that W. Hewer brought hither of\nseveral things painted upon a deal Board, which board is so well\npainted that in my whole life I never was so pleased or surprized\nwith any picture, and so troubled that so good pictures should be\npainted upon a piece of bad deale; even after I knew that it was not\nboard, but only the picture of a board, I could not remove my\nfancy. After supper to bed, being very sleepy and, I bless God, my\nmind at very good present rest."

Thence to\nWhitehall, expecting to have heard the Bishop of Lincolne, my\nfriend, preach, for so I understood he would do yesterday, but was\nmistaken; and therefore away presently back again and there find\neverything in good order against dinner; and at noon come Mr.\nPierce and she, and Mrs. Manuel the Jew’s wife, and Mrs. Corbett,\nand Mrs. Pierce’s boy and girl. But we are defeated of Knepp by her\nbeing forced to act today, and also of Harris; which did trouble me,\nthey being my chief guests. However, Ihad an extraordinary good\ndinner, and the better because dressed by my own servants — and\nwere mighty merry; and here was Mr. Pelling, by chance came and\ndined with me. And after sitting long at dinner, I had a barge ready\nat Tower wharfe to take us in; and so we went, all of us, up as high\nas Barne elmes, 2 very fine day, and all the way sang; and Mrs.\nManuel sings very finely and is a mighty discreet, sober-carriaged\nwoman, that both my wife and I are mightily taken with her; and\nsings well, and without importunity or the contrary. At Barne\nElms we walked round; and then to the barge again and had much\nmerry talk and good singing; and came before it was [dark] back to\nthe New Exchange stairs, and there landed and walked up to Mrs.\nPierce’s, where we sat awhile and then up to their dining-room; and\nso havinga violin and theorbo, did fall to dance, here being also Mr.\nFloyd come thither, and by and by Mr. Harris. But there being so\nfew of us that could dance, and my wife not being very well, we had\nnot much pleasure in the dancing (there was Knepp also, by which\nwith much pleasure we did singalittle); and so about 10 a-clock I\ntook coach with my wife and Deb, and so home and there to bed.\n892\n24 March 1668\n24. Up pretty betimes; and so there comes to me Mr. Shish to\ndesire my appearing for him to succeed Mr. Chr. Pett, lately dead,\nin his place of Maister-Shipwright of Deptford and Woolwich;\nwhich I do resolve to promote when I can. So by and by to\nWhitehall and there to the Duke of York’s chamber, where I\nunderstand it is already resolved by the King and Duke of York that\nShish shall have the place. From the Duke’s chamber, Sir W.\nCoventry and I to walk inthe Matted Gallery; and there, among\nother things, he tells me of the wicked design that now is at last\ncontriving against him, to get a petition presented from people, that\nthe money they have paid to W. Coventry for their places may be\nrepaid them back. And that this is set on by Temple and Hollis of\nthe Parliament and among other mean people in it, by Capt.\nTatnell. And he prays me that I will use some effectual way to sift\nTatnell what he doth, and who puts him on on this business; which\nI do undertake, and will do with all my skill for his service — being\ntroubled that he is still under this difficulty. Thence up and down\nWestminster, by Mrs. Burroughes her mother’s shop, thinking to\nhave seen her, but could not; and therefore back to Whitehall,\nwhere great talk of the tumult at the other end of the town about\nMoorefields among the prentices, taking the liberty of these\nholidays to pull down bawdy houses. And Lord, to see the\napprehensions which this did give to all people at Court, that\npresently order was given for all the soldiers, horse and foot, to be\nin armes; and forthwith alarmes were beat by drum and trumpet\nthrough Westminster, and all to their colours and to horse, as if the\nFrench were coming into the town. So Creed, whom I met here,\nand Ito Lincolnes Inn fields, thinking to have gone into the fields to\nhave seen the prentices; but here we found these fields full of\nsoldiers all in a body, and my Lord Craven commanding of them,\nand riding up and down to give orders like a madman. And some\nyoung men we saw brought by soldiers to the guard at Whitehall,\nand overheard others that stood by say that it was only for pulling\ndown of bawdy houses. And none of the bystanders finding fault\nwith them, but rather of the soldiers for hindering them. And we\nheard a Justice of Peace this morning say to the King that he had\nbeen endeavouring to suppress this tumult, but could not; and that\nimprisoning some in the new prison at Clerkenwell, the rest did\ncome and break open the prison and release them. And that they do\ngive out that they are for pulling down of bawdy houses, which is\none of the great grievances of the nation. To which the King made a\n893\nvery poor, cold, insipid answer: ‘““Why, why do they go to them,\nthen?”’, and that was all, and had no mind to go on with the\ndiscourse.\nMr. Creed and I to dinner to my Lord Crew, where little\ndiscourse, and there being none but us at the table and my Lord and\nmy Lady Jemimah. And so after dinner away, Creed and I, to\nWhitehall, expecting a committee of Tanger, but came too late. So!\nto attend the Council, and by and by were called in with Lord\nBrouncker and Sir W. Penn to advise how to pay awayalittle\nmoney to most advantage to the men of the yards, to make them\ndespatch the ships going out; and there I did make alittle speech,\nwhich was well liked. And after all, it was found most satisfactory\nto the men and best for the King’s despatch, that what money we\nhad should be paid weekly to the men for their week’s work, until a\ngreater sum could be got to pay them their arreares and then\ndischarge them. But Lord, to see what shifts and what cares and\nthoughts there was imployed in this matter, how to do the King’s\nwork and please the men and stop clamours, would make a man\nthink the King should not eat a bit of good meat till he hath got\nmoney to pay the men — but I do not see the least print of care or\nthoughts in him about it all. Having done here, I out and there met\nSir Fr. Hollis, who doth still tell me that above all things in the\nworld he wishes he had my tongue in his mouth; meaning, since my\nspeech in Parliament. He took Lord Brouncker and me down to the\nguards, he and his company being upon the guards today; and there\nhe did, ina handsome room to that purpose, make us drink, and did\ncall for his Bagpiper; which, with pipes of ebony tipped with silver,\nhe did play beyond anything of that kind that ever Iheard in my life.\nAnd with great pains he must have obtained it, but with pains that\nthe instrument doth not deserve at all; for at the best, it is mighty\nbarbarous music. So home, and there to my chamber to prick out\nmy song, It is decreed, intending to have it ready to give Mr. Harris\non Thursdy when we meet for him to sing, believing that he will do\nit more right then a woman that sings better, unless it were Knipp —\nwhich I cannot have opportunity to teach it to."

I did also present a demand of mine for\nconsideration for my travelling charges of coach and boat hire\nduring the war — which though his Royal Highness and the\ncompany did all like of, yet contrary to my expectationIfind him so\nJealous now of doing anything extraordinary, that he desired the\ngentlemen that they would consider it and report their minds in it to\nhim. This did unsettle my mind a great while, not expecting this\nstop: but however, I shall do as well I know, though it causes me a\nlittle stop. But that that troubles me most is that while we were thus\ntogether with the Duke of York, comes in Mr. Wren from the\nHouse, where he tells us another storm hath been all this day almost\nagainst the Officers of the Navy upon this complaint: that though\nthey have made good rules for payment of tickets, yet they have not\nobserved them themselfs; which was driven so high as to have it\nurged that we should presently be put out of our places—and so they\nhave at last ordered that we be heard at the bar of the House upon\nthis business on Thursdy next.\n882\n1—4 March - 1668\n—*MARCH2-\n1. Lords day. Up very betimes and by coach to Sir W.

I\nfind him in great anxiety, though he will not discover it, in the\nbusiness of the proceedings of Parliament; and would as little as is\npossible have his name mentioned in our discourses to them, and\nperticularly the business of selling places is now upon his hand to\ndefend himself in — wherein I did help him in his defence about the\nFlaggmaker’s place which is named in the House. We did here do\nthe like about the complaint of want of victuals in the fleet in the\nyear 1666, which will lie upon me to defend also; so that my head is\nfull of care and weariness in my imployment. Thence home; and\nthere, my mind beingalittle lightened by my morning’s work in\nthe arguments I have now laid together in better method for our\ndefence to the Parliament, I to talk with my wife; and in lieu of a\nCoach this year, I have got my wife to be contented with her closet\nbeing made up this summer and going into the country this\nsummer for a month or two to my father’s, and there Mercer and\nDeb and Jane shall go with them; which [I] the rather do for the\nentertaining my wife, and preventing of fallings-out between her\nand my father or Deb — which uses to be the fate of her going into\nthe country.\n4-5. Up betimes and with Sir W. Penn in his coach to Whitehall,\nthere to wait upon the Duke of York and the Commissioners of the\nTreasury, W. Coventry and Sir Jo. Duncombe — who do declare\nthat they cannot find the money we demand; and we, that less then\nwhat we demand will not set out the fleet intended; and so broke up\nwith no other conclusion then that they would let us have what they\ncould get, and we would improve that as well as we could. So God\nbless us and prepare us against the consequences of these matters.\nThence, it being a cold wet day, I home with Sir\nJ.Mennes in his\ncoach, and called by the way at my bookseller’s and took home\nwith me Kercher’s Musica, very well bound. But I had no comfort\nto look upon them, but as soon as I came home fell to my work at\nthe office, shutting the doors that we, I and my clerks, might not be\ninterrupted; and so, only with room fora little dinner, we very busy\n883\nall the day till night, that the officers met for me to give them the\nheads of what I intended to say; which I did, with great discontent\nto see them all rely on me that have no reason at all to trouble myself\nabout it, nor have any thanks from them for my labour; but\ncontrarily, Brouncker looked mighty dogged, as thinking that\nI did\nnot intend to do it so as to save him. This troubled me so much, as\ntogether with the shortness of the time, and muchness of the\nbusiness, did let me be at it till but about 10 at night; and then, quite\nweary and dull and vexed, I could go no further, but resolved to\nleave the rest to tomorrow morning; and so in full discontent and\nweariness did give over and went home, with[out] supper vexed\nand sickish, to bed — and there slept about three hours; but then\nwaked, and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind,\nthinking of the task I have upon me, and upon what dissatisfactory\ngrounds, and what the issue of it may be to me. With these thoughts\nI lay troubling myself till 6 a-clock, restless, and at last getting my\nwife to talk to me to comfort me; which she at last did, and made me\nresolve to quit my hands of this office and endure the trouble [of] it\nno longer then till I can clear myself of it. So, with great trouble but\nyet with some ease from this discourse with my wife, I up and to\nmy office, whither came my clerks; and so I did huddle up the best I\ncould some more notes for my discourse today; and by 9 a-clock\nwas ready and did go down to the Old Swan, and there by boat,\nwith T. Hater and W. Hewer with me, to Wesminster, where I\nfound myself come time enough and my Brethren all ready. But I\nfull of thoughts and trouble touching the issue of this day; and to\ncomfort myself did go to the Dogg and drink half a pint of mulled\nsack, and in the Hall did drink a dram of brandy at Mrs. Howletts,\nand with the warmth of this did find myself in better order as to\ncourage, truly.\nSo we all up to the Lobby; and between 11 and 12 a-clock were\ncalled in, with the Mace before us, into the House; where a mighty\nfull House, and we stood at the Barr - viz., Brouncker, Sir J.\nMennes, Sir T. Harvey and myself— W. Penn being in the House as\na Member. I perceive the whole House was full, and full of\nexpectation of our defence what it would be, and with great\nprejudice. After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the\nHouse, and read the report of the Committee, I begin our defence\nmost acceptably and smoothly, and continued at it without any\nhesitation or losse but with full scope and all my reason free about\nme, as ifit had been at my own table, from that time till past 3 in the\n884\nafternoon; and so ended without any interruption from the\nSpeaker, but we withdrew. And there all my fellow-officers, and all\nthe world that was within hearing, did congratulate me and cry up\nmy speech as the best thing they ever heard, and my fellow-officers\noverjoyed in it. We were called in again by and by to answer only\none question, touching our paying tickets to ticket-mongers — and\nso out; and we were in hopes to have had a vote this day in our\nfavour, and so the generality of the House was; but my speech being\nso long, many had gone out to dinner and come in again half drunk,\nand then there are two or three that are professed enemies to us and\neverybody else; among others, Sir T. Littleton, Sir Tho. Lee, Mr.\nWiles (the coxcomb whomI saw heretofore at the cockfighting)\nand a few others; I saw these did rise up and speak against the\ncoming to a vote now, the House not being full, by reason of\nseveral being at dinner but most because that the House was to\nattend the King this afternoon about the business of Religion\n(wherein they pray him to put in force all the laws against\nnonconformists and papists); and this prevented it, so that they put\nit off to tomorrow come sennit. However, it is plain we have got\ngreat ground; and everybody says I have got the most honour that\nany could have had opportunity of getting. And so, with our hearts\nmightily overjoyed at this success, we all to dinner to Lord\nBrouncker; that is to say, myself, T. Harvey, and W. Penn, and\nthere dined; and thence with Sir Anth. Morgan, who is an\nacquaintance of Brouncker’s, a very wise man, we after dinner to\nthe King’s House and there saw part of The Discontented Colonell —\nbut could take no great pleasure in it because of our coming in the\nmiddle of it. After the play, home with W. Penn and there to my\nwife, whom W. Hewer had told of my success; and she overjoyed,\nand I also as to my perticular.

But here Sir H.\nCholmly had his propositions read, about a greater price for his\nwork of the Mole, or to do it upon account; which being read, he\nwas bid to withdraw; but Lord, to see how unlucky a man may be\nby chance; for taking an unfortunate minute when they were almost\ntired with other business, the Duke of York did find fault with it,\nand that made all the rest, that I believe he had better have given a\ngreat deal and had it had nothing said to it today; whereas, I have\nseen other things more extravagant pass at first hearing without any\ndifficulty. Thence I to my Lord Brouncker’s at Mrs. Williams’s and\nthere dined, and she did show me her closet; which I was sorry to\nsee, for fear of her expecting something from me; and here she took\nnotice of my wife’s not once coming to see her; which I am glad of,\nfor she shall not — a prating, vain, idle woman. Thence with Lord\nBrouncker to Loriners hall by Mooregate (a hall [I] never heard of\nbefore) to Sir Tho. Teddiman’s burial - where most people\nbelonging to the sea were; and here we had rings, and here I do hear\nthat some of the last words that he said was: that he had a very good\nKing, God bless him, but that the Parliament had very ill rewarded\nhim for all the service he had endeavoured to do them and his\ncountry — so that for certain, this did go far towards his death. But\nLord, to see among the young commanders and Tho. Killigrew and\nothers that came, how unlike a burial this was, Obrian taking out\nsome ballets out of his pocket, which J read and the rest came about\nme to hear; and there very merry we were all, they being new\nballets. By and by the Corps went, and I with my Lord Brouncker\nand Dr. Clerke and Mr. Pierce as far as the foot of London bridge;\nand there we struck off into Thames street, the rest going to\nRedriffe, where he is to be buried. And we light at the Temple and\nthere parted; and I to the King’s House and there saw the last act of\n910\nThe Committee, thinking to have seen Knepp there, but she did not\nact. And so to my bookseller’s and there carried home some books;\namong others, Dr. Wilkins’s Reall Character. And thence to Mrs.\nTurner’s, and there went and sat and she showed me her house from\ntop to bottom, which I had not seen before — very handsome. And\nhere supped; and so home and got Mercer, and she and I in the\ngarden singing till 10 at night; and so home toa little supper, and\nthen parted with great content and I to bed. The Duchess of\nMonmouth’s hip is I hear now set again, after much pain. I am told\nalso that the Countesse of Shrewsbery is brought home by the\nDuke of Buckingham to his house; where his Duchess saying that it\nwas not for her and the other to live together in a house, he\nanswered, ““Why, Madam, I did think so; and therefore have\nordered your coach to be ready to carry you to your father’s;”’\nwhich was a devilish speech, but they say true; and my Lady\nShrewsbry is there it seems."

But the\nplay when it came, though there was here and there a pretty saying,\nand that not very many neither, yet the whole of the play had\nnothing extraordinary in it at all, neither of language nor design;\ninsomuch that the King I did not see laugh nor pleased the whole\nplay from the beginning to the end, nor the company; insomuch\nthat I have not been less pleased at a new play in my life] think. And\nwhich made it the worse was that there never was worse music\nplayed; that is, worse things composed; which made me and Capt.\nRolt, who happened to sit near me, mad. So away thence, very little\nsatisfied with the play, but pleased with my company: I carried\nthem to Kensington to the Grotto, and there we sang to my great\ncontent; only, vexed in going in to see a son of Sir Heneage Finche’s\ngI2\nbeating of a poor little dog to death, letting it lie in so much pain that\nmade me mad to see it; till by and by, the servants of the house\nchiding of their young maister, one of them came with a thong and\nkilled the dog outright presently.

So back by water to Westminster\nPalace and there got a coach who carried us as far as the Minorys,\nand there something of the traces broke, and we forced to light and\nwalked to Mrs. Horsfields house, it being a long and bad way, and\ndark; and having there put her in a-doors, her husband being in bed,\nwe left her; and so back to our coach, where the coachman had put it\nin order, but could not find his whip in the dark a great while,\nwhich made us stay long; at last, getting a neighbour to hold a\ncandle out of their window, Mercer found it, and so away; we\nhome at almost 12 at night; and setting them both at their homes, |\nhome and to bed."

And among other things, one was\nabout this building of a ship with Hemskirkes secret, to sail a third\nfaster than any other ship; but he hath got Prince Rupart on his side,\nand by that means I believe will get his conditions made better then\nhe would otherwise, or ought endeed.

Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon home to dinner,\nand Creed with me; and after dinner, he and I to the Duke of York’s\nplayhouse; and there coming late, he and I up to the Balcony-box,\nwhere we find my Lady Castlemayne and several great ladies and\nthere we sat with them. AndI saw The Impertinents once more, now\nthree times, and the three only days it hath been acted; and to see the\nfolly how the house doth this day cry up the play more then\nyesterday; and I-for that reason like it, I find, the better too. By Sir\nPositive At all, I understand, is meant Sir Rob. Howard. My Lady\npretty well pleased with it; but here I sat close to her fine woman,\nWillson, who endeed is very handsome, but they say with child by\nthe King. I asked, and she told me this was the first time her Lady\nhad seen it, I having a mind to say something to her. One thing of\nfamiliarity I observed in my Lady Castlemayne; she called to one of\n905\nher women, another that sat by this, fora little patch off of her face,\nand put it into her mouth and wetted it and so clapped it upon her\nown by the side of her mouth, I suppose she feeling a pimple rising\nthere. Thence with Creed to Westminster hall and there met with\nCosen Roger, who tells me of the great conference this day between\nthe Lords and Commons about the business of the East India\nCompany — as being one of the weightiest conferences that hath\nbeen, and managed as weightily; Iam heartily sorry Iwas not there,\nit being upon a mighty point of the privileges of the subjects of\nEngland in regard to the authority of the House of Lords and their\nbeing condemned by them as the supreme court; which they say\nought not to be but by appeal from other courts. And he tells me\nthat the Commons had much the better of them in reason and\nhistory there quoted, and believes the Lords will let it fall. Thence\nto walk in the Hall; and there hear that Mrs. Martin’s child, my\ngod-daughter, is dead. And so by water to the Old Swan; and\nthence home and therealittle at Sir W. Penn’s; and so to bed."

And by and\nby, though we designed to have done before company came, much\ncompany came; very fine ladies; and the manner pretty enough,\nonly methinks it cannot be clean to go so many bodies together in to\nthe same water.

But strange to see\nwhen women and men herein, that live all the season in these\nwaters, that cannot but be parboiled, and look like the creatures of\nthe Bath.

Here we dined, and much good talk with him, 7s. 6d: a\nmessenger to Sir Jo. Knight, who was not at home, 6d. Then walked\nwith him and my wife and company round the key, and to the ship;\nand he shewed me the Custom House, and made me understand\nmany things of the place, and led us through Marsh street, where our\n925\ngirl was born. But, Lord! the joy that was among the old poor\npeople of the place, to see Mrs. Willet’s daughter, it seems her\nmother being a brave woman and mightily beloved. And so brought\nus a back way by surprize to his house, where a substantial good\nhouse, and well furnished; and did give us good entertainment of\nstrawberries, a whole venison pasty, cold, and plenty of brave wine,\nand above all Bristoll milk; where comes in another poor woman,\nwho, hearing that Deb was here, did come running hither, and with\nher eyes so full of tears, and heart so full of joy, that she could not\nspeak when she come in, that it made me weep too: I protest that I\nwas not able to speak to her (which I would have done) to have\ndiverted her tears.

After dinner,\ncarried her by coach to St. James’s, where she sat in the coach till Ito\n“my Lady Peterborough; who tells me, among other things, her\nLord’s good words to the Duke of York lately about my Lord\nSandwich, and that the Duke of York is kind to my Lord Sandwich\n— which I am glad to hear. My business here was about her Lord’s\npension from Tanger. Here met with Povy, who tells me how hard\nCreed is upon him, though he did give him, about six months since\nI think he said, 50 pieces in gold. And one thing there is in his\naccounts that I fear may touch me; but I shall help it, [hope.

And the benefit of brick\nwas well seen, for it burnt all inward and fell down within itself—so\n929\nno fear of doing more hurt; so homeward and stopped at Mr. Mills,\nwhere he and she at the door, and Mrs. Turner and Betty and Mrs.\nHollworthy; and there I stayed and talked, and up to the church\nleads and saw the fire, which spent and spent itself, till all fear over; I\nhome, and there we to bed again and slept pretty well. And about 9\nrose; and then my wife fell into her blubbering again and at length\nhad a request to make to me, which was that she might go into\nFrance and live there out of trouble: and then all came out, that I\nloved pleasure and denied her any, and a deal of do; andI find that\nthere have been great fallings-out between my father and her,\nwhom for ever hereafter I must keep asunder, for they cannot\npossibly agree. AndI said nothing; but with very mild words and\nfew suffered her humour to spend, till we begin to be very quiet and\nI think all will be over, and friends; and so I to the office, where all\nthe morning doing business.

At noon home to dinner; and\nthence by coach to Whitehall, where we attended the Duke of York\nin his closet upon our usual business. And thence out and did see\nmany of the Knights of the Guarter with the King and Duke of\nYork, going into the Privy-chamber to elect the Elector of Saxony\ninto the Order; who I did hear the Duke of York say was a good\ndrinker; I know not upon what score this compliment is done him.\nThence with W.

Here I did get the words of a\nsong of Harris that I wanted. Here was also Mr. Young and\nWhistler by chance met us and drank with us. Thence home and to\nprepare business against the afternoon; and did walk an hour in the\ngarden with Sir W.

I to Whitehall and walked through the park fora little\nayre; and so back to the Council chamber to the Committee of the\nNavy, about the business of fitting the present fleet suitable to the\nmoney given; which as the King orders it and by what appears, will\nbe very little, and so as I perceive the Duke of York will have\nnothing to command, nor can intend to go abroad. But it is pretty\nto see how careful these great men are to do everything so as they\nmay answer it to the Parliament.\nThe entries from 5-17 June are written in note form on sheets ofpaper\ninserted into the volume, where ten pages are left blank for the finished\nversion which Pepys never composed.

He tells me that now Buckingham does rule all; and\nthe other day, in the King’s Journy he is now in, at Bagshot and that\nway, he caused Prince Rupert’s horses to be turned out of an Inne,\nand caused his own to be kept there; which the Prince complained\nof to the King, and the Duke of York seconded the complaint but\nthe King did over-rule it for Buckingham; by which there are high\ndispleasures among them — and Buckingham and Arlington rule all.\nThence by water home and to dinner; and after dinner by water\nagain to Whitehall, where Brouncker, W. Penn and I attended the\nCommissioners of the Treasury about the victualling contract —\nwhere high words between Sir Tho. Clifford and us, and myself\nmore perticularly, who told him that something that he said was\ntold him about this business was a flat untruth. However, we went\non to our business in the examination of the draft, and so parted,\nand I vexed at what happened. And Brouncker, W. Penn and I\nhome ina hackney coach—and [all the night so vexed, that Idid not\nsleep almost all night; which shows how unfit Iam for trouble. So\nafter a little supper, vexed and spendinga little time melancholy in\nmaking a base to the Lark’s song, I to bed."

And is much pleased\nwith it, and earnest to have it with us; and he and IJ are like to be\nmuch together in the considering how to reform the Office, and\nthat by the Duke of York’s command. Thence I, mightily pleased\nwith this success, away to the office, where all the morning, my\nhead full of this business; and it is pretty how Lord Brouncker this\nday did tell ine how he hears that a design is on foot to remove us\nout of the office, and proposes that we two do agree to draw up a\nform of a new constitution of the office, there to provide remedies\nfor the evils we are now under, that so we may be beforehand with\nthe world — which I agreed to, saying nothing of my design. And\nthe truth is, he is the best man of them all, and I would be glad, next\nmyself, to save him; for as he deserves best, so I doubt he needs his\nplace most. So home to dinner at noon, and all the afternoon busy at\nthe office till night; and then, with my mind full of businesses now\nin my head, I to supper and to bed.\n26-27. Up, and to the office, where all the morning almost, busy\nabout business against the afternoon; and we metalittle, to sign\ntwo or three things at the Board of moment. And thence at noon\nhome to dinner, and so away to Whitehall by water, in my way to\nthe Old Swan finding a great many people gathered together in\nCannon street about a man that was working in the ruins, and the\nground did sink under him, and he sunk in and was forced to be dug\nout again, but without hurt. Thence to Whitehall; and it is strange\nto see with what speed the people imployed do pull down Paul’s\nsteeple — and with what ease. It is said that it and the Quire are to be\ntaken down this year, and another church begun in the room\nthereof the next. At Whitehall we met at the Treasury chamber, and\nthere before the Lords did debate our draft of the victualling\ncontract with the several bidders for it— which were Sir D. Gawden\n— Mr. Child and his fellows, and Mr. Dorrington and his — a poor\n940\nvariety in a business of this value. There till after candle-lighting,\nand so home by coach with Sir D. Gawden, who by the way tells\nme how the City doth go on in several things toward the building of\nthe public places; which I am glad to hear, and gives hope that in a\nfew years it will be a glorious place. But we met with several stops\nand new troubles in the way in the streets, so as makes it bad to\ntravel in the dark now through the City. So I to Mr. Bateliers by\nappointment, where I find my wife and Deb and Mercer — Mrs.\nPierce and her husband, son and daughter; and Knipp and Harris;\nand W. Batelier and his sister Mary and cousin Gumbleton, a good-\nhumoured, fat young gentleman, son to the Jeweller, that dances\nwell. And here danced all night long, with a noble supper; and\nabout 2 in the morning, the table spread again for a noble breakfast,\nbeyond all moderation, that put me out of countenance — so much\nand so good. Mrs. Pierce and her people went home betimes, she\nbeing big with child; but Knipp and the rest stayed till almost 3 in\nthe morning, and then broke up and Knipp home with us; and I to\nbed and rose about 6 — mightily pleased with this night’s mirth; and\naway by water to St. James’s and there with Mr. Wren did correct\nhis copy of my letter; which the Duke of York hath signed in my\nvery words, without alteration of a syllable.\nAnd so, pleased therewith, I to my Lord Brouncker, who I find\nwithin, but hath business and so comes not to the office today; and\nso I by water to the office, where we sat all the morning; and just as\nthe Board rises, comes the Duke of York’s letter; which I knowing,\nand the Board not being full and desiring rather to have the Duke of\nYork deliver himself to us, I suppressed it for this day, my heart\nbeginning to falsify in this business — as being doubtful of the\ntrouble it may give me by provoking them; but however, I am\nresolved to go through it, and it is too late to help it now. At noon to\ndinner to Capt. Cocke’s, where I met with Mr. Wren, my going\nbeing to tell him what I have done; which he likes — and to confer\nwith Cocke about our office; who tells me that he is confident the\ndesign of removing our officers doth hold, but that he is sure that I\nam safe enough ~ which pleases me; though I do not much show it\nto him, but as a thing indifferent. So away home, and there met at\nSir Rd. Ford’s with the Duke of York’s Commissioners about our\nprizes, with whom we shall have some trouble before we make an\nend with them. And thence, stayingalittle with them, I with my\nwife and W. Batelier and Deb; carried them to Bartholomew fayre,\nwhere we saw the dancing of the ropes and nothing else, it being\n941\n1668 27 August—4 September\nlate; and so back home to supper and to bed — after having done at\nmy Office.\n—+SEPTEMBER*%-\n3. Up, and to the office, where busy till it was time to go to the\nCommissioners of Accounts — which I did about noon, and there\nwas received with all possible respect, their business being only to\nexplain the meaning of one of their late demands to us, which we\nhad not answered in our answer to them; and this being done, away\nwith great content, my mind being troubled before; and so to the\nExchequer and several places, calling on several businesses, and\nperticularly my bookseller’s, among others, for Hobbs’s Leviathan,\nwhich is now mightily called for; and what was heretofore sold for\n8s. Inow give 245. at the second hand, and is sold for 30s., it being a\nbook the Bishops will not let be printed again. And so home to\ndinner, and then to the office all the afternoon; and towards the\nevening, by water to the Commissioners of the Treasury; and\npresently back again and there met a little with W. Penn, and so W.\nPenn and Lord Brouncker and J at the lodging of the latter to read\nover our new drafts of the victualler’s contract; and so broke up,\nand home to supper and to bed.\n4. Up, and met at the office all the morning; and at noon, my wife\nand Deb and Mercer and W. Hewer to the Fair, and there at the old\nhouse did eat a pig, and was pretty merry; but saw no sights, my\nwife having a mind to see the play, Bartholomew fayre with puppets;\nwhich we did, and it is an excellent play; the more I see it, the more I\nlove the wit of it; only, the business of abusing the puritans begins\nto grow stale, and of no use, they being the people that at last will be\nfound the wisest. And here Knipp came to us and sat with us, and\nthence took coach in two coaches; and losing one another, my wife\nand Knipp and I to Hercules Pillars and there supped, and I did take\nfrom her both the words and notes of her song of the Larke, which\npleases me mightily. And so set her at home, and away we home,\nwhere our company came home before us. This night, Knipp tells\nus that there is a Spanish woman, lately come over, that pretends to\nsing as well as Mrs. Knight; both of which I must endeavour to\nhear. So after supper, to bed.\n942"

However, I\nwas obliged to attend the Duke of York, thinking to have had a\nmeeing of Tanger today, but had not; but he did take me and Mr.\nWren into his closet, and there did press me to prepare what Ihad to\nsay upon the answers of my fellow-officers to his great letter; which\nI promised to do against his coming to town again the next week;\nand so to other discourse, finding plainly that he is in trouble and\napprehensions of the reformers, and would be found to do what he\n950\ncan towards reforming himself.\nAnd so thence to my Lord Sandwich; where after long stay, he\nbeing in talk with others privately, I to him; and there he taking\nphysic and keeping his chamber, I had an hour’s talk with him\nabout the ill posture of things at this time, while the King gives\ncountenance to Sir Ch. Sidly and Lord Buckhurst, telling him their\nlate story of running up and down the streets a little while since all\nnight, and their being beaten and clapped up all the night by the\nconstable, who is since chid and imprisoned for his pains. He tells\nme that he thinks his matters do stand well with the King — and\nhopes to have despatch to his mind; but I doubt it, and do see that he\ndoth fear it too. He told me my Lady Carteret’s trouble about my\nwriting of that letter of the Duke of York’s lately to the office;\nwhich I did not own, but declared to be of no injury to G. Carteret,\nand that I would writealetter to him to satisfy him therein. But this\nIam in pain how to do without doing myself wrong, and the end I\nhad, of preparing a justification to myself hereafter, when the faults\nof the Navy come to be found out.

And upon her pressing me, did offer to give\nher under my hand that I would never see Mrs. Pierce more, nor\nKnepp, but did promise her perticular demonstrations of my true\nlove to her, owning some indiscretion in what I did, but that there\nwas no harm in it. She at last on these promises was quiet, and very\nkind we were, and so to sleep; and in the morning up, but with\n27 my mind troubled for the poor girl, with whom Icould not get\nopportunity to speak; but to the office, my mind mighty full of\nsorrow for her, where all the morning, and to dinner with my\npeople and to the’office all the afternoon; and so at night home and\nthere busy to get some things ready against tomorrow’s meeting of\nTanger; and that being done and my clerks gone, my wife did\ntowards bedtime begin to be in a mighty rage from some new\nmatter that she had got in her head, and did most part of the night in\nbed rant at me in most high terms, of threats of publishing my\nshame; and when I offered to rise, would have rose too, and caused\n951\na candle to be lit, to burn by her all night in the chimney while she\nranted; while [I], that knew myself to have given some grounds for\nit, did make it my business to appease her all I could possibly, and\nby good words and fair promises did make her very quiet; and so\nrested all night and rose with perfect good peace, being heartily\nafflicted for this folly of mine that did occasion it; but was forced to\nbe silent about the girl, which I have no mind to part with, but\nmuch less that the poor girl should be undone by my folly. So\nup, with mighty kindness from my wife and a thorough peace;\nand being up, did by a note advise the girl what I had done and\nowned, which note I was in pain for till she told me that she had\nburned it.\nSo by coach with Mr. Gibson to Chancery lane, and there made\noath before a Maister of Chancery to my Tanger account of Fees;\nand so to Whitehall, where by and by a Committee met; my Lord\nSandwich there, but his report was not received, it being late; but\nonly a little business done, about the supplying the place with\nvictuals; but I did get, to my great content, my account allowed of\nFees, with great applause by my Lord Ashly and Sir W.

They walked up and\ndown together the Court this day, and several people joyed them.\nBut I avoided it, that I might not be seen to look either way. This\nday also, I hear that my Lord Ormond is to be declared in Council\nno more Deputy-Governor of Ireland, his commission being\n955\n1668 4 November\nexpired, and the King is prevailed with to take it out of his hands;\nwhich people do mightily admire, saying that he is the greatest\nsubject of any prince in Christendome, and hath more acres of land\nthen any — and hath done more for his prince then ever any yet did.\nBut all will not do; he must down it seems — the Duke of\nBuckingham carrying all before him. But that that troubles me\nmost, is that they begin to talk that the Duke of York’s regiment is\nordered to be disbanded; and more, that undoubtedly his Admir-\nalcy will fallow; which doth shake me mightily, and I fear will have\nill consequences in the nation, for these counsels are very mad. The\nDuke of York doth, by all men’s report, carry himself wonderful\nsubmissive to the King, in the most humble manner in the world;\nbut yet it seems nothing must be spared that tends to the keeping\nout of the Chancellor, and that is the reason of all this. The great\ndiscourse now is that the Parliament shall be dissolved, and another\ncalled which shall give the King the Deane and Chapters lands; and\nthat will put him out of debt. And it is said that Buckingham doth\nknownly meet daily with Wildman and other Commonwealths-\nmen; and that when he is with them, he makes the King believe that\nhe is with his wenches. But that that pleases me most, isthat several\ndo tell me that Pen is to be removed; and others, that he hath\nresigned his place; and perticularly, Spragge tells me for certain that\nhe hath resigned it and is become a partener with Gawden in the\nvictualling —in which Ithink he hath done a\nvery cunning thing, but\nJam sure I am glad of it, and it will be well for the King — to have\nhim out of this office.

My wife and Ispent much time this evening talking of our\nbeing put out of the office and my going to live at Deptford at her\nbrother’s till Ican clear my accounts and rid my hands of the town —\nwhich will take me a year or more; and I do think it will be best for\nme to do so, in order to our living cheap and out of sight.\n956"

We landed at the Temple, and there I did bid him\ncall at my Cosen Roger Pepys’s lodgings, and I stayed in the street\nfor him; and so took water again at the Strand stairs and so to\nWhitehall, in my way Itelling him plainly and truly my resolutions,\nif I can get over this evil, never to give new occasion for it. He is, I\nthink, so honest and true a servant to us both, and one that loves us,\nthat I was not much troubled at his being privy to all this, but\nrejoiced in my heart that Ihad him to assist in the making us friends;\nwhich he did do truly and heartily, and with good success — for I did\nget him to go to Deb to tell her that I had told my wife all of my\nbeing with her the other night, that so, if my wife should send, she\n964\n20 November 1668\nmight not make the business worse by denying it. While I was at\nWhitehall with the Duke of York doing our ordinary business with\nhim, here being also the first time the new Treasurers, W. Hewer\ndid go to her and come back again; and so | took him into St.\nJames’s park, and there he did tell me he had been with her and\nfound what I said about my manner of being with her true, and had\ngiven her advice as I desired. I did there enter into more talk about\nmy wife and myself, and he did give me great assurance of several\nperticular cases to which my wife had from time to time made him\nprivy of her loyalty and truth to me after many and great\ntemptations, and I believe them truly. I did also discourse the\nunfitness to my leaving of my imployment now in many respects,\nto go into the country as my wife desires — but that I would labour\nfit myself for it; which he thoroughly understands, and doth agree\nwith me in it; and so, hoping to get over this trouble, we about our\nbusiness to Westminster hall to meet Roger Pepys; whichI did, and\ndid there discourse of the business of lending him so0o/ to answer\nsome occasions of his, which I believe to be safe enough; and so\ntook leave of him and away by coach home, calling on my coach-\nmaker by the way, where Ilike my little coach mightily. But when I\ncame home, hoping for a further degree of peace and quiet, I find\nmy wife upon her bed in a horrible rage afresh, calling me all the\nbitter names; and rising, did fall to revile me in the bitterest manner\nin the world, and could not refrain to strike me and pull my hair;\nwhich I resolved to bear with, and had good reason to bear it. So I\nby silence and weeping did prevail with hera\nlittle to be quiet, and\nshe would not eat her dinner without me; but yet by and by into a\nraging fit she fell again worse then before, that she would slit the\ngirl’s nose; and at last W. Hewer came in and came up, who did\nallay her fury, I flinging myself in a sad desperate condition upon\nthe bed in the blue room, and there lay while they spoke together;\nand at last it came to this, that if | would call Deb ‘“‘whore”’ under\nmy hand, and write to her that I hated her and would never see her\nmore, she would believe me and trust me — which I did agree to,\nonly, as to the name of ‘‘whore” I would have excused, and\ntherefore wrote to her sparing that word; which my wife thereupon\ntore it, and would not be satisfied till, W. Hewer winking upon me,\nI did write so, with the name of a whore, as that I did fear she might\ntoo probably have been prevailed upon to have been a whore by her\ncarriage to me, and therefore, as such, I did resolve never to see her\nmore. This pleased my wife, and she gives it W. Hewer to carry to\n965\nher, with a sharp message from her. So from that minute my wife\nbegun to be kind to me, and we to kiss and be friends, and so\ncontinued all the evening and fell to talk of other matters with great\ncomfort, and after supper to bed.\nThis evening comes Mr. Billup to me to read over Mr. Wren’s\nalterations of my draft ofa letter for the Duke of York to sign, to the\nBoard; whichI like mighty well, they being not considerable, only\nin mollifying some hard terms which | had thought fit to put in.\nFrom this to other discourse; I do find that the Duke of York and his\nservant Mr. Wren do look upon this service of mine as a very\nseasonable service to the Duke of York, as that which he will have\nto show to his enemies in his own justification of his care of the\nKing’s business. And I am sure I am heartily gladof it— both for the\nKing’s sake and the Duke of York’s, and my own also — forif I\ncontinue, my work, by this means, will be the less, and my share in\nthe blame also. He being gone, I to my wife again and so spent the\nevening with very great joy, and the night also, with good sleep and\nrest, my wife only troubled in her rest, but less then usual — for\nwhich the God of Heaven be praised. I did this night promise to my\nwife never to go to bed without calling upon God upon my knees\nby prayer; and Ibegun this night, and hopeI shall never forget to do\nthe like all my life — for I do find that it is much the best for my soul\nand body to live pleasing to God and my poor wife — and will ease\nme of much care, as well as much expense."

Coventry was just now sent to\nthe tower about the business of his challenging the Duke of\nBuckingham, and so was also Harry Savill to the Gate-house —\nwhich, as a gentleman and of the Duke of York’s bed-chamber, I\nheard afterward that the Duke of York is mightily incensed at, and\ndoth appear very high to the King that he might not be sent thither,\n993\n1669 4 March\nbut to the Tower — this being done only in contempt to him. This\nnews of Sir W. Coventry did strike me to the heart; and with\nreason, for by this and my Lord of Ormond’s business, I do doubt\nthat the Duke of Buckingham will be so fleshed, that he will not\nstop at anything but be forced to do anything now, as thinking it\nnot safe to end here; and Sir W. Coventry being gone, the King will\nhave never a good counsellor, nor the Duke of York any sure friend\nto stick to him — nor any good many will be left to advise what is\ngood. So meeting with my Lord Bellasses, he told me the\nperticulars of this matter; that it arises about a quarrel which Sir W.\nCoventry had with the Duke of Buckingham about a design\nbetween him and Sir Rob. Howard to bring him into a play at the\nKing’s House. Being very much troubled at this, | away by coach\nhomeward, and directly to the Tower, where I find him in one Mr.\nBennet’s house, in the Bricke tower — where I find him busy with\nmy Lord Halifax and his brother; so I would not stay to interrupt\nthem, but only to give him comfort and offer my service to him;\nand so I parted, with great content that I had so earlily seen him\nthere; and so going out, did meet Sir Jer. Smith going to meet me,\nwho had newly been with Sir W. Coventry; and so he and I by\nwater to Redriffe, and so walked to Deptford, where I have not\nbeen I think these twelve months; and there to the Treasurer’s\nhouse, where the Duke of York is, and his Duchesse; and there we\nfind them at dinner in the great room, unhung, and there was with\nthem my Lady Duchess of Monmouth, the Countess of Falmouth,\nCastlemayne, Henrietta Hide my Lady Hinchingbrooke’s sister,\nand my Lady Peterbrough. And after dinner, Sir Jer. Smith and I\nwere invited down to dinner with some of the Maids of Honour;\nviz., Mrs. Ogle, Blake, and Howard (which did me good to have\nthe honour to dine with and look on); and the Mother of the Maids,\nand Mrs. Howard, the mother of the Maid of Honour of that name,\nand the Duke’s housekeeper here. Here was also Monsieur\nBlancfort, Sir Rd. Powell, Coll. Villers, Sir Jona. Trelany, and\nothers. And here drank most excellent and great variety and plenty\nof wines, more then I have drank at once these seven years, but yet\ndid me no great hurt. Having dined and very merry, and\nunderstanding by Blancfort how angry the Duke of York was\nabout their offering to send Savill to the Gate-house among the\nrogues and talking of others as their enemies — they parted; and so\nwe up, and there J did find the Duke of York and Duchess with all\nthe great ladies, sitting upon a carpet on the ground, there being no\n994\nchairs, playing at ‘‘I love my love with an A because he is so and so;\nand I hate him with an A because of this and that;”’ and some of\nthem, but perticularly the Duchess herself and my Lady Castle-\nmaine, were very witty. This done, they took barge, and I with Sir\nJ. Smith to Capt. Cox’s and there to talk, and left them and other\ncompany to drink while I slunk out to Bagwells and there saw her\nand her mother and our late maid Nell, who cried for joy to see me;\nbut Ihad no time for pleasure there nor could stay; but after drinking,\nIback to the yard, having a month’s mind para have had a bout with\nNell—whichI believe Icould have had—and may another time. So to\nCox’s and thence walked with Sir\nJ.Smith back to Redriffe, and so\nby water home; and there my wife mighty angry for my absence and\nfeil mightily out; but not being certain of anything, but think([s] only\nthat Pierce or Knepp were there, and did ask me, and I perceive the\nboy, many questions, but I did answer her; and so after much ado,\ndid go to bed and lie quiet all night; but had another bout with me in\nthe morning, but I did make shift to quiet her, but yet she was not\nfully satisfied, poor wretch, in her mind, and thinks much at my\ntaking so much pleasure from her; which endeed is a fault, though I\ndid not design or foresee it when I went."

After much discourse with him, I walked out\nwith him into St. James’s park; where being afeared to be seen with\nhim (he having not leave yet to kiss the King’s hand, but notice\ntaken, as I hear, of all that go to him) I did take the pretence of my\nattending [the] Tanger Committee to take my leave; though to\nserve him, I should I think stick at nothing. At the Committee this\nmorning, my Lord Middleton declares at last his being ready to go\nas soon as ever money can be made ready to pay the garrison.

Coventry’s advice touching the\npresent posture of the Navy, as the Duke of Buckingham and the\nrest do now labour to make changes therein; and that it were best\nfor him to suffer the King to be satisfied with the bringing in of a\nman or two which they desire. I did also give the Duke of York a\nshort account of the history of the Navy, as to our Office,\nwherewith he was very well satisfied; but I do find that he is pretty\nstiff against their bringing in of men against his mind, as the\nTreasurers were, and perticularly against Child’s coming in,\nbecause he is a merchant. This night I did bring home from the\nKing’s potticary’s in Whitehall, by Mr. Cooling’s direction, a water\nthat he says did him mighty good for his eyes; I pray God it may do\nme good, but by his description, his disease was the same as mine,\nand this doth encourage me to use it.\n5. To the Mullberry garden, where Sheres is to treat us with a\nSpanish Oleo by a cook of his acquaintance that is there, that was\nwith my Lord in Spain. And without any other company, he did do\nit, and mighty nobly; and the Oleo was endeed a very noble dish,\nsuch as I never saw better, or any more of. This, and the discourse\nhe did give us of Spain, and description of the Escuriall, was a fine\ntreat. So we left other things that would keep till night for a\ncollation — and with much content took coach again and went five\n1005\nor six miles towards Branford: the Prince of Tuscany, who comes\ninto England only to spend money and see our country, comes into\nthe town today, and is much expected; and we met him, but the\ncoach passing by apace, we could not see much of him, but he seems\na very jolly and good comely man. By the way we overtook Capt.\nFerrers upon his fine Spanish horse; and he is a fine horse endeed,\nbut not so good, Ithink, as Ihave seen some. He did ride by us most\nof the way, and with us to the park and there he left us, where we\npassed the evening; and meeting The[oph]. Turner, Talbt., W.\nBatelier and his sister in coach, we anon took them with us to the\nMullberry garden; and there, after a walk, to supper upon what was\nleft at noon, and very good; only, Mr. Sheres being taken suddenly\nill for a while did spoil our mirth; but by and by was well again, and\nwe inighty merry. And so broke up, and left him at Charing cross;\nand so calling only at my cousin Turner’s, away home, mightily\npleased with that day’s work: and this day came another new mayd\nfor a middle-maid, but her name I know not yet — and for a cook-\nmaid, we have ever since Bridget went used a blackmoore of Mr.\nBatelier’s (Doll), who dresses our meat mighty well, and we\nmightily pleased with her.

The initials are formed into a monogram: see plate 25.\n1023\n“POSTSCRIPT\n#-\nPepys never kept another diary comparable in scale and character\nwith this, although his eyes quickly recovered from the worst\neffects of the strain which had led him to end it. He later\ncomposed other journals, which were for the most part not\npersonal diaries but memoranda arranged\nin diary form and\nwritten out by clerks. But in July 1683 when he was sent to\nTangier as secretary of the Commission which supervised the\nevacuation of the colony, the occasion called for a descriptive\ndiary. He wrote it in shorthand and it covers the voyage there and\nback, his time in Tangier, and a trip he took in mid-winter to\nS.W. Spain. It has passages that are reminiscent of his diary\nkeeping at its best. But it suffers from its shortness and from the\nlimitations of its purpose: he does not attempt in its pages to lay\nbare his life. What readers of Pepys must regret is that he did not\nresume his great diary in the 1670s and ’80s. His version of those\ncritical years, which included the Popish Plot and Glorious\nRevolution of 1688 (in both of which he was closely involved),\ntold in diary form and in Pepysian detail by one who knew James u1\nso well, would have been an historical source of incomparable\nvalue. It must rank as one of the most interesting books never\nwritten.\n1024\n-“PURTHER READING!%-\nOf the commentaries on the diary the most comprehensive is vol.\nX of the complete edition edited by myself and Professor William\nMatthews — the Companion, 1983 — which has essays by various\nauthors on persons, places and subjects. The most succinct is a\nwork written for the general reader by J. R. Tanner, a pioneer\nscholar to whom all students of Pepys are indebted, Mr Pepys\n(1925), which summarises the subject matter of the diary in\nchapters entitled ‘Books’, ‘The Household’ and so on, and has\nexcellent short accounts of his life before and after the diary\nperiod. C. S. Emden’s Pepys Himself (Oxford, 1963) and Percival\nHunt’s Pepys in the Diary (Pittsburgh, 1959) are also useful. The\nlatter succeeds in preserving something of the charm of the\noriginal. H. B. Wheatley’s Samuel Pepys and World he Lived in\n(1880) and the concluding volume of his edition of the diary\n(Pepysiana, 1899), like W. H. Whitear, More Pepysiana (1927), have\ninformation mostly of an antiquarian sort. So have the two\nvolumes of Occasional Papers ... of the Samuel Pepys Club (priv.\nprtd, 1917, 1925). Special aspects are dealt with in H. C. Levis,\nExtracts from the Diaries and Correspondence of John Evelyn and\nSamuel Pepys relating to Engraving (1915); Helen McAfee, Pepys on\nthe Restoration Stage (New Haven, 1916); A. G. Matthews, Mr\nPepys and Nonconformity (1954);\nJ.H. Wilson, The Private Life ofMr\nPepys (1960) and M. H. Nicolson, Pepys’ Diary and the New Science\n(Charlottesville; 1965). The diary’s evidence necessarily plays a\n‘large part in W. G. Bell’s The Great Fire (1923) and the same\nauthor’s The Great Plague (rev. ed., 1951). Pepys’s shorthand may\nbe studied in the modern reprint of the manual from which he\nlearned the system — Thomas Shelton’s A Tutor to Tachygraphy, or\nShort-writing (for a modern reprint, see above, p. Xiv, n. 2).\n1. The place of publication is London unless otherwise stated.\n1025\nFurther Reading\nApart from the diary and his letters the most important of Pepys’s\nwritings which have been printed are three: his Tangier diary, in\nThe Tangier Papers of Samuel Pepys, transcribed, edited and\ncollated with the transcription by William Matthews by Edwin\nChappell (Navy Records Society, 1935): his Memoires relating to the\nRoyal Navy (1690, cf. pp. xxx—xxxi above) reprinted at Oxford in\n1906 in the Tudor and Stuart Library and edited by J. R. Tanner;\nand his Naval Minutes (ed. Tanner, Navy Records Society, 1926),\na commonplace book of notes he kept in the 1680s and ’gos,\nmostly reflecting on the nation’s neglect of its navy. Six of the\npamphlets he wrote in 1698-9 in his attempt to reform Christ’s\nHospital have been reproduced in fascimile (Rudolf Kirk, ed., Mr\nPepys upon the State of Christ-Hospital, Philadelphia, 1939). His\ntranscription of Charles m’s oral account of his escape after the\nBattle of Worcester has been edited by William Matthews (Charles\n’s Escape from Worcester, 1966).\nA substantial number of Pepys’s letters are available in print. He\npreserved much of his official and private correspondence in four\nletter-books inherited by his nephew Jackson, who himself added\nsome that were among his own papers. A small selection from the\nletter-books was printed in the nineteenth-century editions of the\ndiary by Braybrooke and by Bright. The letter-books have now\nbeen published much more fully by J. R. Tanner in Private\nCorrespondence and Miscellaneous Papers of Samuel Pepys, 1679-1703\n(2 vols, 1926) and Further Correspondence of Samuel Pepys 1662-79\n(1929). A few of the miscellaneous papers and all the shorthand\nletters were omitted by Tanner. The latter were printed by Edwin.\nChappell in Shorthand Letters of Samuel Pepys (Cambridge, 1933).\nOther letters survive in manuscript, principally in the Rawlinson\ncollection in the Bodleian Library. A handful of these were printed\nby Braybrooke and by Bright in their editions of the diary; a larger\nselection (together with a selection from the Tanner volumes) was\npublished and edited by R. G. Howarth in his Letters and the Second\nDiary of Samuel Pepys (1933). (The second diary is the Tangier\ndiary which Howarth printed from John Smith’s defective text of\n1841.) Two other selections have appeared — H. T. Heath’s edition\nof The Letters ofSamuel Pepys and his Family Circle (Oxford, 1955,\nrepr. Westport, Conn., 1979) and some of his correspondence\n1026\nFurther Reading\nwith Evelyn in C. Marburg, Mr Pepys and Mr Evelyn (Philadel-\nphia, 1935).\nOf biographies of Pepys, that by Sir Arthur Bryant is the fullest,\nthough it goes no further than 1689 (3 vols, 1933-8 and later\nissues, Cambridge and London: Samuel Pepys, vol. 1, The Man in\nthe Making; vol. Il, The Years ofPeril; vol. Il, The Saviour of the\nNavy). Its strong points derive from the author’s gift for vivid\nnarrative. Richard Ollard’s Pepys, a Biography (1974; also in\npaperback 1978 and, Oxford, 1984), elegantly written, is far and\naway the best single-volume life and is superior to Bryant as a\ncharacter study. Edwin Chappell’s Eight Generations of the Pepys\nFamily, 1500-1800 (1926) presents the genealogical information in\nan ingenious and accessible form. Pepys’s patron Sandwich is well\nserved by the sound and ample biography by F. R. Harris (2 vols,\n1912).\nThe political background is best studied in David Ogg, England in\nthe Reign of Charles 1 (vol. I, 2nd ed., Oxford, 1955);\nJ. R. Jones,\nCountry and Court, 1658-1714 (1981), and John Miller, James II, a\nStudy in Kingship (Hove, 1977). Debate on the character and\npolitical behaviour of Charles 1 continues; the latest defence is by\nAntonia Fraser (King Charles 11, 1979) and the latest attack by\nRichard Ollard (The Image of the King: Charles 1 and Charles u,\n1979). J. R. Tanner’s Samuel Pepys and the Royal Navy (Cam-\nbridge, 1920), covers Pepys’s career as an administrator. It is\nadmirably supplemented by N. A. M. Rodger, The Admiralty\n(Lavenham, 1979); J. P. W. Ehrman, The Navy in the Wars of\nWilliam 111 (Cambridge, 1958), which casts a great dealoflight on\nthe Pepys period, and Michael Lewis, England’s Sea-Officers\n(1939). For the Second Dutch War, see A. W. Tedder, The Navy of\n_the Restoration (Cambridge, 1916); C. H. Wilson, Profit and Power:\nA study of England and the Dutch Wars (1957); Richard Ollard, Man\nof War: Sir Robert Holmes and the Restoration Navy (1969) and P. G.\nRogers, The Dutch in the Medway (1970). The ships of the line are\ndescribed, with illustrations, in F. Fox, Great Ships: The Battle-fleet\nofCharles 11 (1980). There are three diaries that give vivid pictures\noflife at sea: by a seaman, Edward Barlow (Barlow’s Journals, ed.\nB. Lubbock, 2 vols, 1934); a naval surgeon, James Yonge (Journal,\n1027\nFurther Reading\ned. F. N. L. Poynter, 1963), and a naval chaplain, Henry Teonge\n(Diary, 1675-1679, ed. G. E. Manwaring, The Broadway Travel-\nlers, 1927). The Tangier episode is dealt with in E. M. G. Routh,\nTangier, an Outpost ofEmpire, 1661-84 (1912).\nA list of diaries roughly contemporary with that of Pepys\n(embellished with a sprightly introduction) is to be found in\nWilliam Matthews’s standard bibliography: British Diaries [1442-\n1942] (Univ. Cal. Press and Cambridge, 1950). They are, princi-\npally, those of John Evelyn (the definitive edition is by E. S. De\nBeer, Oxford, 6 vols, 1955; he also published it in slightly reduced\nform in one volume in the Oxford Standard Authors series in\n1959); Robert Hooke (ed. H. W. Robinson and W. Adams, 1935);\nRalph Josselin (the definitive edition is by A. Macfarlane, 1976,\nwho has written an interesting commentary, from the point of\nview of\na social anthropologist, in The Family Life ofRalph Josselin,\nCambridge, 1970); Roger Lowe (ed. W. L. Sachse, 1938); John\nLocke (Locke’s Travels in France 1675-1679, ed. J. Lough, Cam-\nbridge, 1953); Anthony 4 Wood (Life and Times, 5 vols, ed. A.\nClark, Oxford Historical Society, 1891-1900) and Celia Fiennes\n(Journeys, ed. C. Morris, 1947; illust. ed. 1982). Of slighter\ninterest are those of Thomas Rugge, annalist of events in London\n(Diurnal, ed. W. L. Sachse, Camden Society, 1961), and Elias\nAshmole the astrologer (ed. R. T. Gunther, Old Ashmolean\nReprints, 1927). There are summaries of many sixteenth- and\nseventeenth-century diaries, and some observations on diary\nkeeping in general, in A. Ponsonby, English Diaries (1923) and\nMore English Diaries (1927).\n1028\n~&GLOSSARY*®-\nThis list consists of words and phrases, mostly obsolete, which the\nreader may find it difficult to understand. It does not include obsolete\nforms whose meaning is sufficiently clear without explanation — e.g.\njangle (quarrel) or bedaggled (bedraggled). Where a word is used by\nPepys in several senses the different meanings are separated by semi-\ncolons. No note is made of the modern meaning where a word is used in\nboth obsolete and modern senses, nor are all the spellings recorded. Old\nforms of place names — Gracious (Gracechurch) Street, Cales (Cadiz) etc.\n— are to be found not here but in the Index. A few foreign words and\nphrases are included, but there is no attempt to translate titles of books\nand songs, or Pepys’s macaronic language.\nThe definitions in many cases owe much to those given by Dr Richard\nLuckett in the Large Glossary which he compiled for the Companion\nvolume of the full edition of the diary.\nABLE: wealthy BALK: beam of timber BREAK THOUGHTS: disclose\nACCENT: accentuation BALLET: ballad BRIG(ANTINE): small vessel\nACCOUNTANT: Official BAND: neckband equipped for sailing and\nresponsible for BAss: bass viol rowing\nexpenditure BATTELL: cockfight BRISTOL MILK: sweet sherry\nACTOR: male or female BAVIN: bundle of kindling BROTHER: brother-in-law;\nperformer wood colleague\nADMIRAL SHIP: flagship BAYS: baize, light woollen BULLET: cannon ball\ncarrying a. cloth BUSSE: heavily built N.

Its general\ndesign and many of its conventions are based on the index to the\ncomplete edition. Pepys himself is understood to be the subject of\nthe whole diary. A small number of references have been gathered\nunder his hame, covering events before the diary period. Other\nreferences to him are distributed throughout the index, signalled\nby the initial P; Elizabeth Pepys (EP) is similarly treated, the\nreferences under her name being restricted to principal events and\nactivities. London is the almost permanent venue of the events\ndescribed, and references under that heading are confined to civic\naffairs. Otherwise persons and places are given in the commonest of\nforms used in the text here printed (with modern or received\nforms given in square brackets) save where it is convenient or\nlogical to give the modern forms followed by any textual variant\nenclosed in round brackets. Peers and holders of courtesy titles\nappear under their titles; titles and offices held are limited to the\ndiary era, except in a few cases of well-known persons best\nremembered by titles or offices held after 1669 (which information\nis added in square brackets). Bishops are to be found under the\nnames of their sees unless at some point Pepys mentions them by\nsurname. Books, plays and musical compositions are indexed under\nthe names of their authors and composers where these are given\nby Pepys or if more than one work is mentioned; otherwise by\ntitle as printed in italic in the text (representing longhand in the\nMS.); or else under the subject matter if Pepys offers neither\nauthor/composer nor title.\nIt remains for me to thank the Editor and his wife for their help\nat many points in my work.\nC.S.
